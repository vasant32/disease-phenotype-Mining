<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Caveolin-1 (CAV1) acts as a growth suppressor in various human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, but its expression is elevated in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancers</z:e>, suggesting the oncogenic switch of its role during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the molecular basis for the growth-promoting function of CAV1, we characterized its expression status, differential roles for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, and effect on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal elevation of CAV1 was detected in a substantial fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> and cell lines and tightly correlated with promoter CpG sites hypomethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of elevated CAV1 led to AMPK activation followed by a p53-dependent G1 cell-cycle arrest and autophagy, suggesting that elevated CAV1 may contribute to ATP generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CAV1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> downregulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> accumulation, and intracellular ATP level, supporting that aerobic glycolysis is enhanced by CAV1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistently, CAV1 was shown to stimulate GLUT3 transcription via an HMGA1-binding site within the GLUT3 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HMGA1 was found to interact with and activate the GLUT3 promoter and CAV1 increased the HMGA1 activity by enhancing its nuclear localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of HMGA1 increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, whereas its knockdown caused AMPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, GLUT3 expression was strongly induced by cotransfection of CAV1 and HMGA1, and its overexpression was observed predominantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> harboring high levels of CAV1 and HMGA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these data show that elevated CAV1 upregulates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and ATP production through HMGA1-mediated GLUT3 transcription, suggesting that CAV1 may render <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells growth advantages by enhancing aerobic glycolysis </plain></SENT>
