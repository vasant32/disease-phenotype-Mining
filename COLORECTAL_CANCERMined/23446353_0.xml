<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The rapid cell turnover of the intestinal epithelium is achieved from small numbers of stem cells located in the base of glandular crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These stem cells have been variously described as rapidly cycling or quiescent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A functional arrangement of stem cells that reconciles both of these behaviours has so far been difficult to obtain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alternative explanations for quiescent cells have been that they act as a parallel or reserve population that replace rapidly cycling stem cells periodically or after injury; their exact nature remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show mouse intestinal quiescent cells to be precursors that are committed to mature into differentiated secretory cells of the Paneth and enteroendocrine lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, crucially we find that after intestinal injury they are capable of extensive proliferation and can give rise to clones comprising the main epithelial cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, quiescent cells can be recalled to the stem-cell state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings establish quiescent cells as an effective clonogenic reserve and provide a motivation for investigating their role in pathologies such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
