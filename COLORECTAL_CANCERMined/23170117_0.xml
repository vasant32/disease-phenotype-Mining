<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed and the prognostic value was determined using univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PTEN, STAT3 and VEGF-C expression was detected in 32.4, 60.3 and 63.2% of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cases and 90.0, 0 and 0% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTEN and STAT3 were correlated with pathological grade (p=0.011, p=0.001, respectively), but not with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> or clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VEGF-C was correlated with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p=0.002), but not with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, pathological grade or clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of STAT3 and VEGF-C was negatively correlated with PTEN (r=-0.402, r=-0.320, respectively), whereas STAT3 and VEGF-C expression was positively correlated with PTEN (r=0.254) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3- and 5-year survival rates of PTEN protein-positive patients (68.1 and 50.0%, respectively) were significantly higher than those of PTEN protein-negative patients (32.6 and 19.6%, respectively; p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3- and 5-year survival rates of STAT3-positive (29.3 and 17.1%, respectively) were significantly lower than those of STAT3-negative patients (66.7 and 48.1%, respectively; p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 3- and 5-year survival rates of VEGF-C-positive patients (29.3 and 17.1%, respectively) were significantly lower than the rates of VEGF-C-negative patients (66.7 and 48.1%, respectively; p=0.003, p=0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that VEGF-C expression was an independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study indicates that PTEN, STAT3 and VEGF-C expression are beneficial prognostic factors, which may aid in the accurate assessment of prognosis and guide clinical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
