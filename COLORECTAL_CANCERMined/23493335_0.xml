<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current development in biomarker studies is also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerized literature searches of PubMed (National Library of Medicine), the Cochrane Collaboration Library, and commonly accepted US and international guidelines (American Society of Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo>, European Society for Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo>, and National Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Network) were performed from 2001 to 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Literature published before 2001 was noted for historical interest but not evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Literature review was focused on available systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published predictive (associated with treatment response and/or efficacy) and prognostic (associated with disease outcome) biomarkers of known therapeutic targets in colorectal, breast, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, significant health outcomes (e.g. predicted response to therapy, overall survival, disease-free survival, quality of life, lesser toxicity, and cost-effectiveness) were used for making recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> biomarkers were evaluated, two of which (2D6 genotyping, Oncotype Dx) were considered emerging with insufficient evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> biomarkers were evaluated, five of which (EGFR gene expression, K-ras G13D gene mutation, B-raf V600E gene mutation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency</z:e>, and UGT1A1 genotyping) were considered emerging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e> biomarkers were evaluated, five of which were emerging (EGFR gene expression, ERCC gene expression, RRM1 gene expression, K-ras gene mutation, and TS gene expression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 biomarkers evaluated, the following showed evidence of clinical utility and were recommended for routine use in practice: ER/PR and HER2 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>; K-ras gene mutation (except G13D gene mutation) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; and EGFR and EML4-ALK gene mutations for non-small cell lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recommendations for these biomarkers were uniformly supported by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> guidelines </plain></SENT>
