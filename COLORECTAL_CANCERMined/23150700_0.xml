<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: National guidelines recommend that discussions about end-of-life (EOL) care planning happen early for patients with incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We do not know whether earlier EOL discussions lead to less aggressive care near <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the extent to which EOL discussion characteristics, such as timing, involved providers, and location, are associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of care received near <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 1,231 patients with stage IV lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium, a population- and health system-based prospective cohort study, who died during the 15-month study period but survived at least 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our main outcome measure was the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of EOL care received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nearly half of patients received at least one marker of aggressive EOL care, including chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life (16%), intensive care unit care in the last 30 days of life (9%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hospital-based care in the last 30 days of life (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who had EOL discussions with their physicians before the last 30 days of life were less likely to receive aggressive measures at EOL, including chemotherapy (P = .003), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care (P &lt; .001), or any aggressive care (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such patients were also more likely to receive hospice care (P &lt; .001) and to have hospice initiated earlier (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early EOL discussions are prospectively associated with less aggressive care and greater use of hospice at EOL </plain></SENT>
