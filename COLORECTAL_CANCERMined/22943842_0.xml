<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to assess the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic versus open resection of hepatic colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (CRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing initial resection of CRM at a single institution between 1995 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study cohort consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing laparoscopic resection and a cohort of patients undergoing open resection matched on a 4:1 basis by propensity scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables analyzed included patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics, short-term outcomes, and OS and disease-free (DFS) survivals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 35 patients in the laparoscopic cohort and 140 patients in the open cohort were equivalent in terms of age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics, and Clinical Risk Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar proportions of patients in the laparoscopic and open groups underwent synchronous colectomy (9% in both; P = .976) and major hepatectomy (54% vs 51%; P = .705) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood loss (202 vs 385 mL; P &lt; .001), complications (23% vs 50%; P = .004), and duration of stay (4.8 vs 8.3 days; P &lt; .001) were less in the laparoscopic cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year OS (36% vs 42%; P = .818) and DFS (15% vs 22%; P = .346) were also similar in the laparoscopic and open groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic resection of hepatic CRM seems to be a beneficial alternative to open surgery in appropriately selected patients </plain></SENT>
