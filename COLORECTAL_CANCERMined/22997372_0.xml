<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our retrospective study compared Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> (RECIST) version 1.1 with modified CT criteria to determine their respective utilities as a prognostic indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using both sets of criteria, we compared treatment responses of patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> treated with bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy with those of patients treated with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who received bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy (n=30, group 1) or chemotherapy alone (n=29, group 2) for the treatment of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> underwent contrast-enhanced CT before treatment and 2 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists determined changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and density between the pretreatment and 2-month follow-up CT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RECIST 1.1 assesses responses on the basis of changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, and the modified CT criteria assesses responses on the basis of changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> density and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were correlated with time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> by log rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to RECIST 1.1, nine of 30 patients (30%) in group 1 and 12 of 29 patients (41%) in group 2 were good responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the modified CT criteria, 23 of 30 patients in group 1 (77%) and 23 of 29 patients in group 2 (79%) were good responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As assessed by the modified CT criteria, good responders in both groups had significantly longer time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> than poor responders (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As assessed by RECIST 1.1, good responders in group 1 had significantly longer time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> than poor responders (p=0.0154), but there was no difference in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Evaluating treatment response with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and density changes on CT was a better predictor of time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> than changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size alone in both groups </plain></SENT>
