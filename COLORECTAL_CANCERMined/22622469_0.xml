<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor progression</z:e> while receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) has been associated with poor outcome and is commonly considered a contraindication to liver resection (LR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to clarify in a large multicenter setting whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> is always a contraindication to LR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the LiverMetSurvey international registry were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing LR for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> without extrahepatic disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 1990 and 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 2143 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> occurred in 176 (8.2 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk of progression was increased after 5-FU or irinotecan (22.7 % vs. 6.8 % after other regimens, p &lt; 0.0001; 14.9 % vs. 7.2 %, p &lt; 0.0001), while it was reduced after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (5.6 % vs. 12.0 %, p &lt; 0.0001) and still diminished among patients receiving targeted therapies (2.6 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> was an independent prognostic factor of survival at multivariate analysis (35 % vs. 49 %, p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> group, 3 independent prognostic factors were identified: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ≥ 200 ng/mL (p = 0.003), &gt;3 metastases (p = 0.028), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter ≥ 5 0 mm (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A survival predictive model showed that patients without any risk factors had 5-year survival rates of 53.3 %; good survival results were still observed if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were &gt;3 or ≥ 50 mm (29.9 and 19.1 %, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, survival was less than 10 % at 3 years in the presence of &gt;1 prognostic factor or CEA of ≥ 200 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> is a negative prognostic factor, but it is not an absolute contraindication to LR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> could be scheduled for LR except for those with &gt;3 metastases and ≥ 50 mm, or CEA ≥ 200 ng/mL in whom further chemotherapy is recommended </plain></SENT>
