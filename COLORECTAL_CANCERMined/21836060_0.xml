<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line HCT116 is known to have a mutation in the hMLH1 mismatch repair gene resulting in microsatellite instability and defective mismatch repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Honokiol is a biphenolic compound that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating various ailments including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that honokiol enhances the radiosensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells with mismatch repair defect (HCT116) compared with those that are mismatch repair proficient (HCT116-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29438">CH3</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first determined that the combination of honokiol and Î³-irradiation treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation and colony formation in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the effects were more pronounced in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the combination induced higher levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (caspase 3 activation, Bax to Bcl2 ratio) in the HCT116 cells compared with HCT116-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29438">CH3</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analyses revealed higher levels of dead cells in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination treatment reduced expression of cyclin A1 and D1 and increased phosphorylated p53 in both cell lines, although there were significantly lower amounts of phosphorylated p53 in the HCT116-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29438">CH3</z:chebi> cells, suggesting that high levels of hMLH1 reduce radiosensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that honokiol is highly effective in radiosensitizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, especially those with a mismatch repair defect </plain></SENT>
