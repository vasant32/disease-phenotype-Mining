<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Given the potential interference between treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) and surgical procedures, we sought to determine the prevalence of major surgery following mCRC diagnosis in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cohort study used physician-surveyed data from the LifeLink™ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Analyzer database for mCRC patients in five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom [UK]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients aged ≥21 years at mCRC diagnosis and with data collected during 2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Major surgical procedures were examined descriptively by the purpose and location of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study sample included 3,249 mCRC patients; 515, 862, 656, 649, and 567 were from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following mCRC diagnosis, at least one major surgical procedure for any purpose was seen in 30.5% (UK), 35.2% (Germany), 35.6% (Spain), 36.3% (France), and 38.4% (Italy) of patients, with a mean of 1.3 (UK) to 1.6 (France) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of major surgery for curative purposes was the highest in Italy (13.4%), followed by France (12.8%), Spain (10.3%), and Germany (9.2%); the lowest was in the UK (7.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major surgery performed on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> (12.4-27.1% of patients, depending on the country) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (6.4-14.6%) made up the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Major surgery is highly prevalent following mCRC diagnosis, suggesting an important role in meeting the goals of mCRC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of pharmacological treatment options and their potential to interfere with both surgery use and surgical outcomes should be considered when evaluating mCRC treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
