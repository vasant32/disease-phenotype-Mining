<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: African American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients have worse survival outcomes than Caucasian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether differences exist in the molecular mechanisms driving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between African Americans and Caucasians, we characterized patient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from a single institution by assessing genetic alterations involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively examined 448 African Americans and Caucasians diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at The University of Chicago Medical Center between 1992 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability (MSI) status was determined by genotyping the BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, D5S346, and BAX loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in KRAS codons 12 and 13 and BRAF codon 600 were identified by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSI and detected mutations were correlated with clinicopathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, no difference existed in MSI or BRAF mutation frequencies between African Americans and Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, African Americans with microsatellite stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>)/MSI-low (MSI-L) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had a higher proportion of KRAS mutations than Caucasians (34% vs. 23%, P = 0.048) that was isolated to proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> and primarily driven by mutations in codon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no racial difference in receipt of chemotherapy, but African Americans with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>/MSI-L <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had a 73% increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> over Caucasians that could not be explained by known prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The significantly higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among African Americans with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>/MSI-L <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> may be related to differences in the distribution of factors influencing response to standard therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data underscore the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms driving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression in underserved and understudied populations </plain></SENT>
