<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual characteristics, family trees and colonoscopy findings of asymptomatic first-degree relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were classified into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and/or non-invasive high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>), high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (≥ 10 mm and/or a villous component) and low-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (tubular &lt; 10 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dependent variable was the presence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and/or high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-three relatives (147 females), 50.0 ± 11.5 (range, 25-75) years of age, agreed to participate out of a total of 618 who were invited (acceptance rate 42.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Index cases were diagnosed at 63.8 ± 12.4 (range, 37-88) years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The closest familial relationship was parent/offspring in 168 (63.9%) participants and sibling in 95 (36.1%) participants; 14.8% had three or more relatives with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, and two or more affected generations were identified in 24.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was found in 56 (21.3%) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e>, non-invasive high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in five (1.9%), six (2.3%) and 45 (17.1%) participants, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in 20 (7.6%) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Male sex (odds ratio, 2.59; P = 0.003) and sibling relationship (odds ratio, 2.74; P = 0.001) were independently associated with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We detected advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in a considerable number of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data support colonoscopy screening in first-degree relatives of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at an earlier age than in the medium-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Male sex and sibling relationship were predictors of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
