<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to estimate the frequency and characteristics of HNPCC gene mutations in a population-based sample of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The analysis included 1893 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancer</z:e> ascertained from three population-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Full-germline DNA sequencing of the coding regions was performed on three HNPCC genes, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collection of demographic, clinical and family history information was attempted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine clearly pathogenic mutations were identified, including five in MSH6, two each in MLH1 and MSH2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 28 unique predicted pathogenic missense variants were identified in 55 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathogenic mutation carriers had an earlier mean age at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, overrepresentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with non-serous histologies and a higher number of relatives with HNPCC-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fewer than 1% of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> harbour a germline mutation in the HNPCC genes, with overrepresentation of MSH6 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This represents a lower-range estimate due to the large number of predicted pathogenic variants in which pathogenicity could not definitively be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identification of mismatch repair gene mutations has the potential to impact screening and treatment decisions in these women </plain></SENT>
