<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-one SNPs in 26 microRNA-related genes were genotyped in 1,097 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recruited at the University of Texas MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center (Houston, TX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were enrolled between 1990 and 2008 and last follow-up was in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations between genotypes and recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) stratified by clinical stage were analyzed in 741 newly diagnosed patients (diagnosed within 1 year) and replicated the findings in an additional 356 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with stage III disease, mir608: rs4919510 was associated with increased risk for both recurrence [HR, 2.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-5.33] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR, 3.53; 95%CI, 1.42-8.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The associations were confirmed in the replication set, and the combined HRs for training and replication sets were 1.65 (95% CI, 1.13-2.41) for recurrence and 1.96 (95% CI, 1.19-3.21) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mir219-1:rs213210 showed consistent association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the training set (HR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.33-11.22), the replication set (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.39-7.98), and combined data set (HR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.70-6.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In combined analysis of these two SNPs, patients carrying the variant genotypes at both sites exhibited a 5.6-fold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms in the microRNA pathway may predict prognosis in patients with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
