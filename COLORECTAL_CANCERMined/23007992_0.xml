<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (70 women and 61 men) were matched for gender and age to 206 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the two groups was 62 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meat intake, cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking were assessed using a specific frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The body mass index was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from peripheral blood; RsaI polymorphism genotypes were evaluated by PCR-RFLP and 96-bp insertion genetic polymorphisms were evaluated by specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distributions of CYP2E1 RsaI c1/c1, c1/c2 and c2/c2 genotypes were 90.2, 9.2 and 0.6%, respectively, in controls and 83.9, 13.7 and 2.4% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allele c2 was associated with increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> [odds ratio (OR) = 1.88, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.02-3.45] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CYP2E1 RsaI c2/c2 genotype was associated with an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 3.23, 95%CI = 1.26-9.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 96-bp insertion was slightly more frequent in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> group (9.3 vs 11.4%, P = 0.19), especially in females (6.4 vs 11.5%, P = 0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Smoking, alcohol drinking or high intake of red meat and CYP2E1 polymorphisms were not associated with increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 96-bp insertion was marginally more frequent (P = 0.07) in undernourished <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is higher among individuals with allele c2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The CYP2E1 RsaI c2/c2 genotype was associated with an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
