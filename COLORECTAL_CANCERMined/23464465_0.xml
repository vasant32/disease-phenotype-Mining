<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here therefore studied PTEN, VEGF, HER2 and p53 by immunohistochemistry as possible prognostic and predictive factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: A total of 34 retrospectively collected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples were evaluated, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from patients receiving bevacizumab-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VEGF-A, PTEN, HER2, p53 were assessed and data was compared with clinicopathologic characteristics of patients and the bevacizumab response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: In this study, the median age of the 34 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients was 55.5 (24-75), twelve (35.3%) being women and 22 (64.7%) men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PTEN, VEGF, HER2, p53 expressions were compared with bevacizumab response and other chacteristics of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical significant differences were not found between bevacizumab response rates and different expression levels of VEGF, PTEN, HER2 and p53 (respectively p=0.256, p=0.832, p=0.189, p=0.131) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a survival difference was noted in the VEGF expression negative group (median OS:55 months; 95%CI, 22-88 months) (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant OS difference in other groups (PTEN p=0.6, HER2 p=0.189, p53 p=0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: We did not find any predictive factor for BV therapy in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VEGF negative expression could be an important prognostic factor in metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
