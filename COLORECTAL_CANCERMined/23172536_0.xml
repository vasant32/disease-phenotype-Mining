<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the RNAi and the chemotherapy drugs nolatrxed on the expression of thymidylate synthase(TS) and the growth of the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> LOVO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The siRNA was constructed targeting the human TS gene, and then transfected into the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> LOVO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Western blot technique were used to observe the TS gene and protein expression levels, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was used to detect cell proliferation after silencing the TS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, siRNA and nolatrxed were applied to the LOVO cells to observe the TS protein expression and cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TS siRNA significantly reduced the expression of TS gene and protein in LOVO cells, and inhibited cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IC50 value of LOVO cells was (1.46±0.25) μmol/L in TS siRNA combined with nolatrexed group, (6.81±0.31) μmol/L in the negative control group, and (6.47±0.43) μmol/L in the single nolatrexed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment of TS siRNA combined with nolatrexed on LOVO cells for 36 hours, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> index was higher than that in single TS siRNA and nolatrexed[(62.12±0.89)% vs.(21.56±0.67)% and(40.51±0.83)%, both P&lt;0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TS siRNA can partly suppress the expression of TS gene in LOVO cells, inhibit cell proliferation, promote cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and enhance cell sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by nolatrexd </plain></SENT>
