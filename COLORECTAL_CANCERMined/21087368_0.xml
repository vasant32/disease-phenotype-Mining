<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended using three times a country's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as the threshold for economic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the WHO criteria, pharmacoeconomic modelling was used to illustrate the application of value-based price towards bevacizumab, a relatively new drug that provides a 1.4-month survival benefit to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A decision model was developed to simulate outcomes in mCRC patients receiving chemotherapy Â± bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained from randomized trials and costs from Canadian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Utility estimates were determined by interviewing 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> nurses and pharmacists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A price per dose of bevacizumab was then estimated using a target threshold of $CAD117,000 per quality adjusted life year gained, which is three times the Canadian per capita GDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For a 1.4-month survival benefit, a price of $CAD830 per dose would be considered cost-effective from the Canadian public health care perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the drug were able to improve patient quality of life or survival from 1.4 to 3 months, the drug price could increase to $CAD1560 and $CAD2180 and still be considered cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The use of the WHO criteria for estimating a value-based price is feasible, but a balance between what patients/governments can afford to pay and the commercial viability of the product in the reference country would be required </plain></SENT>
