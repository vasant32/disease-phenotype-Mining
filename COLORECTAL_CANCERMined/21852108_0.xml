<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aberrant expression of Eph and ephrin proteins in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> is extensively documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data are frequently limited to one gene and therefore incomplete and in some instances conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Eph and ephrin genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines and 153 clinical specimens, providing for the first time a comprehensive analysis of this system in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eph/ephrin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and correlated with protein expression (flow cytometry, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data show that EphA1, EphA2, EphB2 and EphB4 were significantly over expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, at least one Eph gene was found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon (EphA1, EphA2, EphB2, EphB4), where expression was observed at high levels in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, other Eph gene expression was lost in individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> compared to the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, EphA7 being a striking example </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of expression was more common in advanced disease and thus correlated with poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the redundant functionality of Eph receptors, such that expression of a single Eph gene is sufficient for effector function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the data suggest a progressive loss of expression of individual Eph genes suggesting that individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> need to be phenotyped to determine which Eph genes are highly expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Targeted therapies could then be selected from a group of specific antibodies, such as those developed for EphA1 </plain></SENT>
