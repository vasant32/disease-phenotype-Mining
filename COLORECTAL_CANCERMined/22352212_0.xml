<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present article is to study the role of drainage tubes on the management of minor anastomotic dehiscences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively review clinical reports of 18 consecutive patients with anastomotic dehiscence after open elective colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 63 years and the male - female ratio was 5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine (50%) patients underwent re-operation for fecal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> (group A) while the remaining nine (50%) were managed conservatively (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The parameters evaluated in both groups were: time of the anastomotic breakdown, clinical findings, amount of fluid drained the day of the dehiscence, diagnostic means used, length of stay and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anastomotic leakages were observed medially after 3, 6 days from surgery in group A and after 5.6 days in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clinical manifestations were: fecal material through the tubes (88.9%), pelvic pain (88.9%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (77.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in group A had a median faecal fluid flow of 235cc the day of the dehiscence and 130cc those in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Imaging was employed only in three cases in group A and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The length of hospital stay was longer in patients treated surgically: 37 days versus 29 in those treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minor anastomotic leakages generally occur later than greater ones, they have a milder clinical presentation and can be managed conservatively with the use of drain tubes </plain></SENT>
