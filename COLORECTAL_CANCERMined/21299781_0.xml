<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical trial units are integral to the functioning of a medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> department with patient access to clinical trials an important component in patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been a paucity of potential key performance indicators in medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> and clinical trial information may be utilised for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to record retrospectively and collate prospectively collected information regarding basic demographics, response rate, progression and survival plus grade 3 or 4 toxicity in patients enrolled in clinical trials for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> at the Sydney <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Centre between 1999 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline patient demographics, clinical response, progression dates, grade 3 or 4 toxicities plus treatment-related fatalities were collected from individual clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were clinical response, progression-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a total of 14 trials undertaken during the defined period for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was available information for 243 patient trials with sufficient information regarding response rates, toxicity, progression and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> response rates ranged from 27% to 66% for first line chemotherapy trials and 0% to 20% for non-first line chemotherapy trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall progression-free survival was 6.4 months and overall survival 14.0 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one treatment-related fatality on clinical trial during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of our clinical database have been used here to illustrate the concept and value of reporting clinical trial information in medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Public reporting of such information may allow for comparisons between units and for quality improvement </plain></SENT>
