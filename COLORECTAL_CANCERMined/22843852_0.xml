<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MutL is a mismatch repair protein known to coordinate several steps in repair that ultimately results in strand removal following mismatch identification by MutS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MutL homologs from bacteria to humans contain well-conserved N-terminal and C-terminal domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the contribution of the MutL N-terminal domain to mismatch repair, we analyzed 14 different missense mutations in Bacillus subtilis MutL that were conserved with missense mutations identified in the human MutL homolog MLH1 from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333990" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We characterized missense mutations in or near motifs important for ATP binding, ATPase activity, and DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 13 of the 14 missense mutations conferred a substantial defect to mismatch repair in vivo, while three mutant alleles showed a dominant negative increase in mutation frequency to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mutL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed immunoblot analysis to determine the relative stability of each mutant protein in vivo and found that, although most accumulated, several mutant proteins failed to maintain <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> levels, suggesting defects in protein stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining missense mutations located in areas of the protein important for DNA binding, ATP binding, and ATPase activities of MutL compromised repair in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results define functional residues in the N-terminal domain of B. subtilis MutL that are critical for mismatch repair in vivo </plain></SENT>
