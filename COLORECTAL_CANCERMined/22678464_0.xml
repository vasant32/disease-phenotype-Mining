<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Smoking is widely accepted as the most important risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the modern world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several constituents of cigarette smoke are known to interact with drug-metabolizing enzymes, potentially affecting the outcomes of drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab (Erbitux(Â®); Merck Serono) is indicated for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with respect to restoring chemosensitivity to irinotecan in irinotecan-resistant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether cigarette smoking adversely affects the actions of cetuximab in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who were treated with cetuximab in our hospital during the time period from 2009 through 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the adverse reaction rates of 16 patients who smoked (smokers) with those of 38 patients who did not smoke (non-smokers, including 16 patients who never smoked and 22 patients who were former smokers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of skin reactions after cetuximab treatment was lower in the smokers than in the non-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> was higher in the smokers than in the non-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the group of non-smokers, no statistically significant differences were observed between the never smokers and the former smokers with regard to adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cigarette smoking during anticancer treatment with cetuximab-based regimens reduces the skin reaction, which leads to a reduction in the benefit of the treatment; therefore, patients should quit smoking, at least while receiving cetuximab-based treatment </plain></SENT>
