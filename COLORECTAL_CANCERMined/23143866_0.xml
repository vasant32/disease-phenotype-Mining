<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Elective surgical resection is the curative treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Up to 30 % of patients present as surgical emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to determine the association between presenting with an emergency condition and consequent outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery in the Appalachian state of West Virginia (WV) in comparison to the rest of the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent a surgical procedure from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2007 were selected, and those with a diagnosis requiring emergency surgery were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures were length of stay (LOS), total hospital charges, and inpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean LOS was higher for WV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean charges were higher for the USA than for WV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in WV were greater than the rest of the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those undergoing emergency surgery spent 51.9 % (β=0.40) more days in the hospital than those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For WV, LOS was 7.6 % (β=0.07) higher than that of the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hospital charges for those that underwent emergency resection were 68.3 % (β=0.52) higher than those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The odds of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were 1.68 (95 % CI=1.42-1.98) times greater in WV than in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those that underwent emergency surgery had a nearly four times (OR 3.88; 95 % CI=3.74-4.03) greater chance of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study stresses the ongoing burden of emergency surgeries in many states around the nation and the need to increase awareness about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening practices, especially in patients who are at increased risk of the disease </plain></SENT>
