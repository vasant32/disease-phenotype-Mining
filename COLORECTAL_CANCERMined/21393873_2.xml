<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The over expression of fascin, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), and ezrin proteins has been associated with poor prognosis in various <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, very few studies have reported the relationship between the expression of fascin, EMMPRIN, and ezrin proteins and the clinico-pathologic parameters of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim was to investigate the relationship between fascin, EMMPRIN, and ezrin proteins in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and their correlation with clinico-pathologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The expression of fascin, EMMPRIN, and ezrin proteins was studied in 210 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients through immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining by the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> peroxidase method was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The scoring of each protein expression was done and divided into three groups (negative, low-, and high-expression groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A chi-square test, and Kendall's tau-b correlation test were used for comparing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests and the Cox proportional hazard model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of the high-expression group of fascin, EMMPRIN, and ezrin proteins in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were 24%, 73%, and 62%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weak positive correlations were observed among these protein expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increased expression of the fascin protein was significantly associated with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> depth and shorter survival times, and a high expression of fascin protein was an independent prognostic factor in univariate and multivariate survival analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EMMPRIN and ezrin protein expressions were not associated with the clinico-pathologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high expression of fascin protein may be an unfavorable prognostic marker for individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
