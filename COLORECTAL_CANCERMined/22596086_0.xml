<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of the water extracts of H. androsaemum (HA) and H. perforatum (HP) were investigated in two human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>-derived cell lines, HCT15 and CO115, which harbour activating mutations of KRAS and BRAF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrarily to HP, HA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HA decreased BRAF and phospho-ERK expressions in CO115, but not in HCT15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HA also decreased Akt phosphorylation in CO115 and induced p38 and JNK in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
