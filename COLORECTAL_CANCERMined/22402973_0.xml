<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Two stage hepatectomy is currently a method of choice for the treatment of multifocal bilobar hepatic lesions, especially in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a technique that facilitates second-stage hepatectomy by taping the major vascular structures of the right liver and performing a hanging maneuver during the first stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: At the first-stage hepatectomy, the right hepatic artery and the right portal branch are dissected free and taped with color-coded <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A classic hanging maneuver is performed using a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These three loops are left in situ until the second-stage hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the second-stage hepatectomy, the presence of the vascular tapes appears a major aid in the subsequent dissection and control of the major vascular structures, and the hanging loop helps parenchymal section and surgeon orientation, without liver mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient a biliary leak developed after the first-stage procedure, and this required reoperation for drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there is a risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in this setting, there were no vascular complications related to the tape positioning, nor was there any incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> related to the use of the <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The technique described here has been in regular use in our department since 2009, and in our experience, it may facilitate second-stage hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
