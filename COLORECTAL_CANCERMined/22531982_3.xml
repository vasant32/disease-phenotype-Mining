<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> for colonoscopy is largely administered by anesthesiologists or anesthesiology nurses in the United States (US) and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopist-directed administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (EDP) by nonanesthesiologists has recently been proposed, with potential savings of anesthetist reimbursement costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess potential EDP-related benefit in a screening setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a Markov model the total number of screening and follow-up colonoscopies in a cohort of 100 000 US subjects were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anesthetist-assisted colonoscopy was compared with an EDP strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Model outputs were projected onto the 50 - 80-year-old US population, assuming 27 % as the current uptake for colonoscopy screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anesthetist costs were estimated using the mean reimbursement for the corresponding Medicare code (≥ 65-year-olds) and from commercial insurance information (50 - 64-year-olds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of colonoscopies with anesthesiologist assistance was estimated from the Medicare database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean nurse salary was used to estimate the cost of a 2-week EDP training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absolute number of US endoscopists was estimated by inflating by 33 % the number of board-certified gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No EDP mortality was assumed in the reference scenario, and 0.0008 % mortality in the sensitivity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>US census data were adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analogous inputs were used for France to assess EDP-related benefit in a European country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EDP training for 17 166 nurses (one for each US endoscopist) showed a cost of $ 47 million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cost estimates for anesthesiologist assistance for colonoscopy were $ 95 (Medicare) and $ 450 (non-Medicare commercial insurance), with 34.8 % of colonoscopies requiring anesthesiologist assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>US implementation of an EDP policy showed a 10-year saving of $ 3.2 billion (Monte Carlo analysis 5 - 95 % percentiles $ 2.7 - $ 11.9 billion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the sensitivity analysis, assuming 50 % of colonoscopies were anesthetist-assisted showed an EDP benefit of $ 4.6 billion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Assuming a 0.0008 % mortality rate, the incremental cost - effectiveness of anesthetist-assisted colonoscopy versus an EDP policy was $ 1.5 million per life-year gained, supporting EDP as the optimal choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A 31-fold increase of EDP-related mortality or a 17-fold cost reduction for anesthetist-assisted colonoscopy was required for EDP to become not cost-effective in this scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Implementation of an EDP policy in France, within a guaiac-fecal occult blood test (g-FOBT) screening program, was estimated to save € 0.8 billion in 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The absolute economic benefit of EDP implementation in a screening setting is probably substantial with 10-year savings of $3.2 billion in the US and €0.8 billion in France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The impact of an eventual EDP-related mortality on EDP cost - effectiveness seems marginal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The huge economic and medical resources entailed by anesthetist-assisted colonoscopy could be more efficiently invested in other clinical fields </plain></SENT>
