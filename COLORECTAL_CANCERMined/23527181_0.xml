<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this regard, maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35191">triterpene</z:chebi> extracted from wax-like coatings of olives, is known to inhibit proliferation and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines without affecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy and associated mechanisms of maslinic acid treatment on spontaneous intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in Apc(Min/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two mice were randomized into 2 groups: control group and MA group, fed with a maslinic acid-supplemented diet for six weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MA treatment reduced total intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> formation by 45% (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Putative molecular mechanisms associated with suppressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0200008'>intestinal polyposis</z:hpo> in Apc(Min/+) mice were investigated by comparing microarray expression profiles of MA-treated and control mice and by analyzing the serum metabolic profile using NMR techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The different expression phenotype induced by MA suggested that it exerts its chemopreventive action mainly by inhibiting cell-survival signaling and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes eventually induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the metabolic changes induced by MA treatment were associated with a protective profile against intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of MA against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumor</z:e> development in the Apc(Min/+) mice model, suggesting its chemopreventive potential against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
