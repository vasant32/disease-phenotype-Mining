<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine whether carnosic acid (CA), the main <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> compound of Rosmarinus officinalis L., would inhibit the cell viability of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines: Caco-2, HT29 and LoVo in a dose-dependent manner, with IC₅₀ values in the range of 24-96 µM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CA induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Caco-2 line after 24 h of treatment and inhibited cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration, possibly by reducing the activity of secreted proteases such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and metalloproteinases (MMPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These effects may be associated through a mechanism involving the inhibition of the COX-2 pathway, because we have determined that CA downregulates the expression of COX-2 in Caco-2 cells at both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CA modulates different targets involved in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that carnosic acid may have anticancer activity and may be useful as a novel chemotherapeutic agent </plain></SENT>
