<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the results of SILS with those of conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for malignant colorectal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 27 patients who received SILS for the treatment of malignant disease using a home-made multiple-port system were compared with those of 68 patients who received CLS performed in a standard manner using four to five trocar sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, gender, disease stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size between the SILS and CLS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common surgery was high anterior resection in both groups (SILS, 63.0%vs CLS, 58.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the groups in types of surgery performed, length of bowel resected, resection margin, blood loss, duration of surgery or postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative pain scores were significantly higher in the SILS group than in the CLS group (3.07 ± 1.14 vs 2.41 ± 0.63, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SILS is as effective as CLS, and is not associated with increased duration of surgery, blood loss or complications </plain></SENT>
