<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and assess the quality of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of pharmaceutical therapies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and EconLit databases were searched for the Medical Subject Headings or text key words quality-adjusted, QALY, life-year gained (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>), and cost-effectiveness (January 1, 1999-December 31, 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Original CEAs of mCRC pharmacotherapy published in English were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CEAs that measured health effects in units other than quality-adjusted life years or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> and letters to the editor, case reports, posters, and editorials were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Each article was independently assessed by 2 trained reviewers according to a quality checklist created by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four CEA studies pertaining to pharmaceutical therapies for mCRC were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies showed a wide variation in methodologic approaches, which resulted in a different range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios reported for each regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found common methodologic flaws in a significant number of CEA studies, including lack of clear description for critique of data quality; lack of method for adjusting costs for inflation and methods for obtaining expert judgment; no results of model validation; wide differences in the types of perspective, time horizon, study design, cost categories, and effect outcomes; and no quality assessment of data (cost and effectiveness) for the interventions evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown a wide variation in the methodology and quality of cost-effectiveness analysis for mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improving quality and harmonization of CEA for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further study is suggested to assess the quality of CEA methodology outside the mCRC disease state </plain></SENT>
