<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy and safety of CAPIRI+bevacizumab (Bev) in comparison with FOLFIRI+Bev as first-line treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI plus Bev 5 mg kg(-1) every 2 weeks (Arm-A) or CAPIRI plus Bev 7.5 mg kg(-1) every 3 weeks (Arm-B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-three patients (Arm-A=167; Arm-B=166) were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in median progression-free survival (PFS) (10.0 and 8.9 months; P=0.64), overall survival (25.7 and 27.5 months; P=0.55) or response rates (45.5 and 39.8.7%; P=0.32) for FOLFIRI-Bev and CAPIRI-Bev, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with CAPIRI-Bev presented significantly higher incidence of diarrhoea (P=0.005), febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (P=0.003) and hand-foot skin reactions (P=0.02) compared with patients treated with FOLFIRI-Bev </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment delays (P=0.05), dose reduction (P&lt;0.001) and treatment discontinuation owing to toxicity (P=0.01) occurred more frequently in the CAPIRI-Bev arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The PFS of FOLFIRI-BEV is not superior to that observed with the CAPIRI-Bev regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CAPIRI-Bev has a less favourable toxicity profile, requiring dose reductions, in order to be considered as an option in first-line treatment of patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
