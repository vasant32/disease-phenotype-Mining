<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of 276 samples, analysing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and microRNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 16% of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase Îµ (POLE) mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Excluding the hypermutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers, colon</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancers</z:e> were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression </plain></SENT>
