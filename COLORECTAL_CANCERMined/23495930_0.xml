<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Enteric glia form a network in the intestinal mucosa and have been suggested to engage in multidirectional interactions with the epithelium, blood vessels, nerves, and immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, due to the dispersed nature of the glial network, standard histology cannot provide a global view of the network architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prepared transparent human colon mucosa for three-dimensional (3-D) confocal microscopy with S100B immunostaining to reveal the location-dependent glial network for qualitative and quantitative analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Full-thickness human colons were acquired from colectomies performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We targeted the mucosa away from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site to characterize the glial network <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Optical clearing (use of immersion solution to reduce scattering) was applied to generate transparent specimens for deep-tissue microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Two features of the glial network were seen: (i) A dense glial population resides at the crypt base/mucosal boundary in contact with the lymphatic vessels, and (ii) from the base, the glial network elongates along the crypt axis with peri-cryptic and peri-vascular connections toward the opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We quantified the mucosal glia as the S100B-positive cells with at least two processes extending from the cell body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examples of the global and in-depth imaging of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> were given to illustrate the morphological correlation between the loss of glial fibers and the aberrant crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS &amp; INFERENCES: We have established a useful approach for 3-D imaging, panoramic illustration, and quantitation of the enteric glia in the human colon mucosa to help characterize their roles with mucosal components in health and disease </plain></SENT>
