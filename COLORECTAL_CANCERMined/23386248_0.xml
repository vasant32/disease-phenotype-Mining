<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the importance of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1*28 in irinotecan pharmacogenetics, our capability to predict drug-induced severe toxicity remains limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed at identifying novel genetic markers that would improve prediction of irinotecan toxicity and response in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (leucovorin), fluorouracil (5-FU), and irinotecan (camptosar)-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationships between UGT1A candidate markers across the gene (n = 21) and toxicity were prospectively evaluated in 167 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included variants in the 3'untranscribed region (3'UTR) of the UGT1A locus, not studied in this context yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These genetic markers were further investigated in 250 Italian FOLFIRI-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several functional UGT1A variants, including UGT1A1*28, significantly influenced risk of severe hematologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As previously reported in the Italian cohort, a 5-marker risk haplotype [haplotype II (HII); UGTs 1A9/1A7/1A1] was associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in our cohort [odds ratio (OR) = 2.43; P = 0.004] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of a 3'UTR single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) permitted refinement of the previously defined HI, in which HIa was associated with the absence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in combined cohorts (OR = 0.55; P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested UGT1A variations and upon multivariate analyses, no UGT1A1 SNPs remained significant, whereas three SNPs located in the central region of UGT1A were linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> grade 3-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analyses of these markers with the 3'UTR SNP allowed the identification of a protective HI (OR = 0.50; P = 0.048) and two risk haplotypes, HII and HIII, characterized by 2 and 3 unfavorable alleles, respectively, revealing a dosage effect (ORs of 2.15 and 5.28; P â‰¤ 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that specific SNPs in UGT1A, other than UGT1A1*28, may influence irinotecan toxicity and should be considered to refine pharmacogenetic testing </plain></SENT>
