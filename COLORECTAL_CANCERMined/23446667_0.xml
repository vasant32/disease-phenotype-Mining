<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to measure the time requirements and health effects of colonoscopy and computed tomography colonography (CTC) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective diary study in a consecutive sample within a randomized controlled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening trial, comparing primary colonoscopy and CTC screening for average-risk individuals aged 50 - 74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diary ended when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screening-related complaints had passed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diary was returned by 75 % (241/322) of colonoscopy and 75 % (127/170) of CTC screenees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median interval between leaving home and returning from the examination was longer for colonoscopy (4 hours and 18 minutes [4:18], interquartile range [IQR] 3:30 - 5:00) than for CTC (2:30 hours, IQR 2:06 - 3:00; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the time to return to routine activities was longer after colonoscopy (3:54 hours, IQR 1:48 - 15:00) than after CTC (1:36 hours, IQR 0:54 - 4:42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration of screening-related symptoms after the examination was shorter for colonoscopy (11:00 hours, IQR 2:54 - 20:00) than for CTC (22:00 hours; IQR 5:30 - 47:00; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abdominal complaints were reported more frequently after CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo>, pain, and quality of life worsened during the screening process, with no differences between the two examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with colonoscopy, CTC screening required less time and allowed screenees to return to their daily activities more quickly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CTC was associated with a twofold longer duration of screening-related symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Feelings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, pain, and quality of life scores were similar during colonoscopy and CTC screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results should be incorporated into cost-effectiveness analyses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening techniques </plain></SENT>
