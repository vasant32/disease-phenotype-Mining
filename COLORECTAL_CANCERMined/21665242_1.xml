<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the value of p53 immunohistochemistry in microsatellite instability-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> prescreening and attempted to clarify the relationship between DNA mismatch repair system and p53 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a series of 104 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, we performed p53 immunohistochemistry, TP53 mutational analysis, DNA mismatch repair system efficiency evaluation (DNA mismatch repair system immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability status, MLH1/MSH2 germ line, and BRAF, murine double minute 2, and p21 immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability high was observed in 25 of 104 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, with DNA mismatch repair system protein loss (24/25) and germ line (8/25) or BRAF mutations (8/25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p53 immunohistochemistry revealed 3 distinct patterns of expression: complete negative immunostaining associated with truncating TP53 mutations (P &lt; .0001), diffuse overexpression associated with missense TP53 mutations (P &lt; .0001), and restricted overexpression characterized by a limited number of homogenously scattered strongly positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in 36.5% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This latest pattern was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> TP53 and microsatellite instability high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (P &lt; .0001) including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Lynch <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (8/8), but its presence among 22% of DNA mismatch repair system-competent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> decreased its positive predictive value (55.2% [95% confidence interval, 45%-65%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was also correlated with murine double minute 2 overexpression (P &lt; .0001) and inversely with p21 loss (P = .0002), independently of microsatellite instability status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a restricted pattern of p53 overexpression is preferentially associated with microsatellite instability high phenotype and could, therefore, be of clinical use as signal for microsatellite instability analysis in a large-scale <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its association with concomitant murine double minute 2 overexpression suggests an alternative mechanism of p53 pathway deregulation </plain></SENT>
