<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Secreted frizzled related proteins (SFRPs) play important roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> progress through antagonizing Wnt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, SFRPs has not been systematically studied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary purpose of the study was to discuss the relationship between the expression of SFRPs and the clinicopathologic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of SFRPs were analyzed in 20 paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and adjacent non-cancerous tissues by quantitative real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein expression of SFRP1 and SFRP4 were verified by Western blot in those 20 paired samples and were further detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in other 206 colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of SFRP1 and SFRP5 were significantly downregulated in 85 and 80% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, respectively; but SFRP4 was overexpressed in 16 of 20 CRC samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were concordant with those obtained from the Western blotting in SFRP1 and SFRP4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IHC analysis demonstrated increasing SFRP4 expression and decreasing SRFP1 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with HIN and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SFRP1 and SFRP4 appear to be candidate markers for colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike SFRP1 as a negative regulator for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, SFRP4 may play quite different biological role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
