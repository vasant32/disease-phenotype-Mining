<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of ESD as an initial treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to nine expert panelists in colorectal ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire used retrospective data from consecutive case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven cases of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> (≥ 20 mm) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic growth types were 25 laterally-spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (LST) of granular type (G), 15 LST of non-granular types (NG), and seven protruded types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathological diagnoses included 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (Ad), 18 intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (M), three submucosally-shallow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancers</z:e> (&lt; 1000 µm) (SMs), and 11 submucosally-deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancers</z:e> (≥ 1000 µm) (SMd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expert panelists completed questionnaires about recommended initial treatment under suppositions of before and after the introduction of ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over-surgery was defined as surgery for Ad, M, and SMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Non-curative endoscopic resection (ER) was defined as ER for SMd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the introduction of ESD, the reduction in the over-surgery rate was estimated at 10.8% for Ad, M, and SMs, and the increase in the non-curative ER rate was estimated at 27.2% for SMd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By endoscopic growth type, the reduction of over-surgery rates for LST-NG, LST-G, and protruded type was 15.5%, 10.5%, and 2.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopists changed their therapeutic strategy for large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> to reduce over-surgery, especially in LST-NG, demonstrating the impact of ESD </plain></SENT>
