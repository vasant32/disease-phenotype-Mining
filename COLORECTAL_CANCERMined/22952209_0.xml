<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Case management (CM) models based on experienced nurses are increasingly used to improve coordination and continuity of care for patients with complex health care needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anyway, little is known about the effects of hospital-based CM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To analyse the effects of hospital-based CM on (i) GPs' evaluation of information from the hospital and collaboration with the hospital staff and (ii) patients' contacts with GPs during daytime and out of hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial allocated 280 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients 1:1 to either a control group or CM intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Patients were recruited at a Danish surgical department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An ad hoc piloted questionnaire was sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients' GPs 30 weeks after patients' recruitment and the responses from the two groups of GPs were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Registry data on patients' contacts with general practice during daytime and out of hours were collected 9 months after recruitment and the data from the two groups were compared quarterly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CM was associated with an overall tendency towards more positive GP evaluations, which for 3 of 20 items reached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistically significantly fewer GPs of CM patients reported contacting the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CM did not affect the number of patient contacts with the GPs during the daytime, but CM patients showed a tendency towards more contacts to the out-of-hours GP services than non-CM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CM was appreciated by the GPs and reduced their need for subsequent hospital contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CM increased the number of patient contacts to the out-of-hours GP services </plain></SENT>
