<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether laparoscopic surgery for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> is cost-effective in comparison with open surgery remains unclear, because laparoscopic surgery results in shorter hospital stays but is associated with increased equipment costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open surgery for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, incorporating factors not included in previous cost-effectiveness studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A decision analysis model was constructed, and extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to test the assumptions of the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Data were taken from previously published studies; data from large randomized trials were used whenever possible as inputs into the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients enrolled in the trials from which data were gathered for the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: There were no interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open surgery for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laparoscopic resection results in savings of $4283 and essentially no difference in quality-adjusted life-years (0.001 more quality-adjusted life-years than open resection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses indicate that laparoscopic surgery is cost-effective at &lt;$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year under almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only circumstance that affects the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery is postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of the additional time off work for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> repair, laparoscopic resection is cost-effective only if it results in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> rate less than or equal to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other variables, the laparoscopic approach remains less costly than the open approach with no difference in quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The model relies on data from other studies, rather than being an independent trial designed to specifically collect these data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic resection for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> results in decreased costs and equivalent quality of life, making it the preferred approach in suitable patients </plain></SENT>
