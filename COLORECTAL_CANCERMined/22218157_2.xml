<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is increasing sharply in Korea, and evidence has suggested the role of dietary <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> supply and related polymorphisms on colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and alcohol intake, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 787 cases and 656 controls were recruited from 2 university hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and corresponding 95% CIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MTHFR 677T homozygotes were at a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.78 for TT compared with CC/CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake was associated with reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.84 for high compared with low intake), and high alcohol consumption was associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.46 for high compared with low intake) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When data were stratified by the amount of dietary <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> (combined intake of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and alcohol), those with low-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> diets had higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.18, 4.56) than did those with high-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> diets among CC/CT carriers, whereas the amount of dietary <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> did not affect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk among carriers with the TT homozygous variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was stronger in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that the effect of dietary <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> supply on colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> may differ according to MTHFR C677T genotype and the subsite of origin in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
