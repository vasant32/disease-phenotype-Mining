<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to assess the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (overall and subsite specific) among EC survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODSA historical cohort study was performed by linking the Manitoba <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and the Manitoba Health administrative databases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were followed up to the date of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, migration, or study end point (December 31, 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Competing-risk proportional hazards models were used to compare the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates with adjustment for age, history of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were three mutually exclusive (and competing) outcomes: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, another primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: hazard ratio [HR] = 4.41; 95% CI, 1.47 to 13.26; right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: HR = 7.48; 95% CI, 1.29 to 43.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among women 51 to 65 years of age or those older than 65 years at the time of EC diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, women 51 to 65 years of age at EC diagnosis had an increased risk of right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (HR = 2.30; 95% CI, 1.05 to 5.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONThis study suggests young women (age â‰¤ 50 years) with EC are at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; risk of right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is also increased in women 51 to 65 years old at EC diagnosis </plain></SENT>
