<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations are the most common oncogenic event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) progression and their occurrence is associated with lack of response to anti epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using preclinical models and patients' samples we recently reported that the emergence of KRAS mutations but also KRAS amplification is associated with acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitors cetuximab or panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that KRAS amplification may also be responsible for primary resistance to these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, while the prevalence of KRAS mutations has been well established in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, little is known about the frequency of KRAS amplification in large <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a screening of 1,039 CRC samples to assess the prevalence of KRAS amplification in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type and further evaluated the role of this genetic alteration on the sensitivity to anti EGFR therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected KRAS amplification in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens and cell lines, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although KRAS amplification is an infrequent event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, it might be responsible for precluding response to anti-EGFR treatment in a small proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
