<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study of microsatellite instability was done with antibodies to hMSH2 and hMSH6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 blocks were analysed from patients aged 16-83 years (median 56 years); 14 blocks (43.8%) were from resections and 18 (56.2%) were from biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An adenomatous component was present in 4 (12.5%) blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue showed strong nuclear reactivity to hMSH2 and hMSH6 in 96.9% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of loss of expression was 3.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of mutation in our sampled population was low and matched the rate reported in the literature from industrialized countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm the use of these markers in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
