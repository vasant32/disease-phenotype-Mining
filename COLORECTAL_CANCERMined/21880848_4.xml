<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Frequent use of personal, nonprotocol calcium supplements obscured an adverse effect of coadministered calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> (CaD) on cardiovascular risk in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of the use of personal calcium or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplements on other outcomes in the WHI CaD Study (WHI CaD) by using the WHI limited-access clinical trials data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The WHI CaD was a 7-y, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of CaD (1 g Ca/400 IU <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> daily) in 36,282 community-dwelling, postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699893" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nonmelanoma skin cancers</z:e>), breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, hip and total fracture, and mortality was assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the WHI CaD, interactions between the use of either personal calcium or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplements and CaD were found for total, breast, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> but not for fracture or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 15,646 women (43%) who were not taking personal calcium or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplements at randomization, CaD significantly decreased the risk of total, breast, and invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> by 14-20% and nonsignificantly reduced the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women taking personal calcium or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplements, CaD did not alter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk (HR: 1.06-1.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For women in the WHI CaD who were not taking personal calcium or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplements at randomization, CaD decreased the risk of total, breast, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and did not change the risk of fractures or total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nonskeletal effects of CaD may be more important than the skeletal effects and should be considered when evaluating these supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The WHI CaD trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000611 </plain></SENT>
