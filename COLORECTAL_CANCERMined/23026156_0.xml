<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This systematic review identifies and explores the challenges faced by parents and their (non)affected or at risk children caused by the (non)disclosure of genetic risk information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Qualitative meta-synthesis and thematic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Ovid databases; Ovid 'in progress', British Nursing Index, Embase, Medline and Psychinfo were combined with searches of EBSCOhost databases; CINAHL and ERIC and Web of science and ZETOC databases using truncations of communication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illness and disease and words relating to family with specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e>; Cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>Fibrosis</z:mp>, Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>Muscular Dystrophy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Familial Adenomatous Polyposis</z:e>, Hereditary Non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's Disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>Neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> and Sickle Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was augmented with free Internet and hand searches and an exploration of the bibliographies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> included papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>REVIEW METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> papers were quality assessed to ascertain their research quality and methodological rigour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2033 citations were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following the removal of duplicates, irrelevant articles and the application of an inclusion criterion, 12 articles remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A further three papers were omitted due to poor quality leaving nine papers which focussed on the disclosure of genetic information between parent and child (&lt;18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight papers were qualitative in design and one used a mixed method approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thematic synthesis produced four themes that inform the structure of the paper; disclosure, emotions involved in disclosure, desired disclosure and recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Disclosure of genetic risk information within families is a highly complex and affective process often resulting in delayed disclosure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This can lead to increased family tensions generated by misunderstanding, blame and secrecy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early, age appropriate disclosure can better prepare children for future considerations such as care planning and reproductive decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It also contributes to effective coping strategies that promote enhanced adaptation and emotional well being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Early disclosure also reduces parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxieties</z:hpo> concerning disclosure from an unwitting source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Research shows that children and young people want their parents to engage in open and honest discussions about the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic condition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore to help facilitate effective family communication health professionals should provide family centred care and better emotional and informational support </plain></SENT>
