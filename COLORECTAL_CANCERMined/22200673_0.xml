<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression levels of natural killer group 2 member A (NKG2A) and natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) in NK cells as well as the regulatory function of NKG2D in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and 32 healthy controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of NKG2A and NKG2D <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were investigated using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was performed to assay the levels of NKG2A and NKG2D proteins in NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of NKG2D <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in PBMCs in the patients were significantly lower than those in the controls [mean ± SD, 1.11 ± 0.60 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients) vs. 1.65 ± 0.71 (healthy controls); p &lt; 0.01], whereas the 2 groups showed no apparent difference in the levels of NKG2A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the patients showed significantly lower NKG2D levels in NK cells than the controls did (71.23% ± 8.31% [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients] vs. 79.39% ± 5.58% [healthy controls]; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, we observed no distinct difference in the NKG2A expression levels in NK cells between the 2 groups (p&gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notably, blockage of NKG2D signaling with anti-NKG2D antibodies ex vivo resulted in decreased cytotoxicity and CD107a degranulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data revealed that the decrease in NKG2D expression levels may have been associated with suppression of NK cell activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
