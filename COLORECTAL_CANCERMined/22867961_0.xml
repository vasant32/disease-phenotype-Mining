<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reviews the primary and secondary technical effectiveness, overall survival of patients, recurrence-free survival, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-free survival, rates of local recurrence, and postprocedural RFA complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Technical effectiveness and rates of complication with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location and size were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results were compared with similar studies from Europe and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 63 patients (109 tumours) treated with RFA between February 2004 and December 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average and median follow-up time was 19.4 and 16.5 months, respectively (range, 1-54 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from patient charts, pathology, and Picture Archiving and Communication System was integrated into an Excel database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical Analysis Software was used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary and secondary technical effectiveness of percutaneous and intraoperative RFA were 90.8% and 92.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average (SE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-free survival was 14.4 ± 1.4 months (range, 1-43 months), and average (SE) recurrence-free survival was 33.5 ± 2.3 months (range, 2-50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence was seen in 31.2% of treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (range, 2-50 months) (34/109) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 89.4% at 1 year, 70.0% at 2 years, and 38.1% at 3 years, with an average (SE) overall survival of 37.0 ± 2.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were 14 postprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in technical effectiveness for small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (1-2 cm) vs intermediate ones (3-5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in technical effectiveness for peripheral vs parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated good-quality outcomes for RFA treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from a Canadian perspective and compared favorably with published studies </plain></SENT>
