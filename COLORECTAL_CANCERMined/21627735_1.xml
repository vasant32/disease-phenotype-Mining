<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haggitt's line was used as baseline and the invasion depth was classified into two groups, head invasion and stalk invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was investigated between patients with head and stalk invasion </plain></SENT>
