<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> plays a key role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e>, the present study analyzed the polymorphisms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related genes and their impact on survival after curative resection in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-seven patients were enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genomic DNA was extracted from fresh colorectal mucosal tissue, and 15 SNPs of 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related genes were determined using a Sequenom MassARRAY system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 41.8 (range, 1.1-85.5) months patients alive at last follow-up, 65 relapses and 57 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the target polymorphisms, the RIPK1 rs2272990 in a dominant model and the CASP7 rs2227310 in a recessive model of the minor allele were associated with survival in a log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the GA+AA genotype of the RIPK1 rs2272990 and the GG genotype of the CASP7 rs2227310 were significantly correlated with a worse disease-free (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.093; P = 0.007 and HR = 2.641; 0.002, respectively) and disease-specific survival (HR = 2.222; P = 0.013 and HR = 2.247; P = 0.031, respectively) in a multivariate survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The RIPK1 and CASP7 polymorphisms can be considered as possible prognostic markers for survival after curative resection in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
