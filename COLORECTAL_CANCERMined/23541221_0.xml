<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction: The HOXB13 pGly84Glu mutation has recently been associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> but the association of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites with this allele has not been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data has suggested that HOXB13 expression levels are decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines indicating this gene may be involved in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumourigenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: To evaluate a potential association of this mutation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we genotyped the mutation in 2695 CRC cases and 4593 controls from population-based registries in Canada and Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: The HOXB13 pGly84Glu mutation was more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases than controls (0.48% vs. 0.17%, P=0.02) indicating a significant association between the HOXB13 variant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (OR=2.8; 95%CI: 1.2-6.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association was attenuated but remained significant with the inclusion of previously published and publicly available genotype data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pedigree analysis of cases and controls revealed that 7/21 HOXB13 mutation carriers had a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discussion: This report is the first to suggest a risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> associated with mutations in the HOXB13 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings require further validation but may be of importance in the screening and genetic counseling of families known to carry the HOXB13 pGly84Glu mutation </plain></SENT>
