<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A common genetic variant, rs4939827, located in SMAD7, was identified by two recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies to be strongly associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the following replication studies yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND FINDINGS: We conducted a case-control study of 641 cases and 1037 controls in a Chinese population and then performed a meta-analysis, integrating our and published data of 34313 cases and 33251 controls, to clarify the relationship between rs4939827 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our case-control study, the dominant model was significant associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.46; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.19-1.80] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following meta-analysis further confirmed this significant association for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models but with significant between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> &lt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By stratified analysis, we revealed that ethnicity, sample size, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sites might constitute the source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative analysis suggested that evident tendency to significant association was seen with adding study samples over time; whilst, sensitive analysis showed results before and after removal of each study were similar, indicating the highly stability of the current results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results from our case-control study and the meta-analysis collectively confirmed the significant association of the variant rs4939827 with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, fine-mapping of the susceptibility loci defined by rs4939287 should be imposed to reveal causal variant </plain></SENT>
