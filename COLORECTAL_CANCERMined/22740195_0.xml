<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radical resection is the central component of curative therapy in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate treatment results in patients with locoregionally <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1995 to December 2007, surgery was performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> in 82 patients who had undergone curative (R0) resection of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment included patient, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and treatment characteristics, postoperative complications, and time without re-recurrence; recurrence-free and overall survival rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resection was performed in 60 of the 82 patients (73 %), repeat R0 resection in 52 % (31/60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had a postoperative morbidity of 39 % (31/82), a relaparotomy rate of 13 % (11/82), and a <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> of 7 % (6/82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surgically-treated patients received a permanent stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Re-recurrence was seen in 52 % (16/31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>R0 resection was associated with a 5-year survival rate of 35 % (11/31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extensive reinterventions often enable repeat R0 resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite relevant morbidity, the <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> appears to be acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Decisive for the prognosis is re-recurrence </plain></SENT>
