<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although adequate knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening tests has a significant effect on screening behavior, there is still no clear information in this regard in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was therefore to identify knowledge toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and obstacles to screening tests among an Iranian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a preliminary analysis with baseline data drawn from an ongoing randomized community trial among people aged 50 years and over in municipal district 6 in Tehran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 360 members of health houses, who were not being exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests, completed the baseline survey and randomized to two study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected via personal interviews by 12 trained interviewers for demographics, knowledge related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and barriers to screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 58.0 (Â± 7.13) ranging from 50 to 86 years; 69% were female, 52% were unemployed, 65% had completed high school, and 90% had medical insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A considerable number of respondents stated that they had never heard about fecal occult blood test (61%) and colonoscopy (51%) as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In general, participants were more likely to respond the knowledge items inaccurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four commonly stated reasons for not being screened were "absence of clinical symptoms" (29%); "doctor did not recommend the test" (26%); "never think of the test" (22%); and "did not think it was needed" (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that lack of knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and various barriers to screening tests exist among Iranians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results may facilitate the development of effective educational strategies primarily aimed at high-risk people </plain></SENT>
