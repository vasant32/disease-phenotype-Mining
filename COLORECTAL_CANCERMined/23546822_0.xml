<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male and female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors (n = 1,768), aged ≥65 and ≥5 years post-diagnosis, completed surveys on their current PA, social participation, HQOL, health history, and relevant covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the cross-sectional relationship between PA and social participation with the SF-36 subscales, as well as the physical component summary score (PCS) and mental health component summary score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The final analytic sample (n = 832) was 81.5 ± 5.8 years and 8.2 ± 1.7 years post-diagnosis (mean ± SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meeting the current recommendation of 150 min/week of PA was associated with higher PCS (p &lt; 0.001) but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> (p = 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Engaging in any social participation, vs. none, was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> (p = 0.003), but not PCS (p = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a dose-response relationship between moderate-vigorous-intensity PA and PCS (p trend&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Light-intensity PA was not associated with either summary score after adjustment for moderate-vigorous PA (p &gt; 0.05), but in survivors performing no higher-intensity PA, it was associated with both (p &lt; 0.01, p = 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants reporting greater amounts of both planned exercise and non-exercise PA had significantly higher PCS (p trend&lt;0.01, p trend &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals participating in greater weekly hours of social participation had higher PCS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> (p trend&lt;0.05) than those participating in less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among older, long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors, PA is related to their physical health, while social participation is predominantly related to their mental health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CANCER</z:e> SURVIVORS: Older <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors who participate socially and are engaged in PA, even non-exercise and light-intensity activities, have higher levels of physical and mental health </plain></SENT>
