<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies to date have considered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as a single disease; however, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> that develop on the left and right sides of the colorectum display important phenotypic differences, suggesting they may also have different risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A population-based case-control study was conducted in Western Australia to examine the relationship between intake of both natural dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and supplements containing <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and the risk of left- and right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were available for 850 cases (575 left-sided and 275 right-sided) and 958 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were calculated using multinomial logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no association between natural dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake and risk of either left-or right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Supplement use similarly had no significant effect on right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, long-term supplement users (4+ yr) were at lower risk of left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than those who had not taken supplements (OR = 0.65, 95% CI, 0.50-0.86) and there was a significant trend in risk reduction as duration of use increased (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
