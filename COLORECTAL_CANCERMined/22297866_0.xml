<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventy-six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>,who had received surgical resection, were endoscopically followed-up to detect the development of metachronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or adenocarcinoama </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between the risk factors such as age, synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with index <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or other clinicopathological variables and the formation of postoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was assessed using the logrank test and the Cox proportional hazard model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age over 60, synchronous lesions at the time of surgery for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>(DM) as the associated disease were positively related to the formation of postoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among those patients with the three risk factors, only 27.8% remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-free during 5 years after operation, whereas in the group without any risk factor, it was 90.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From our data, age over 60, synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and DM were the potential risk factors for the postoperative formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and they should be taken into consideration when defining the appropriate interval of postoperative colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
