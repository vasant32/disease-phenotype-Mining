<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the complementary value to a Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Candidate genes were selected by applying cluster alignment and computational analysis of promoter regions to microarray-expression data of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation was measured by quantitative methylation-specific PCR on 34 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa, 71 advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, and 64 CRC tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The performance as biomarker was tested in whole stool samples from in total 193 subjects, including 19 with advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 66 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For a large proportion of these series, methylation data for GATA4 and OSMR were available for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complementary value to FIT was measured in stool subsamples from 92 subjects including 44 with advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phosphatase and Actin Regulator 3 (PHACTR3) was identified as a novel hypermethylated gene showing more than 70-fold increased DNA methylation levels in advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a stool training set, PHACTR3 methylation showed a sensitivity of 55% (95% CI: 33-75) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and a specificity of 95% (95% CI: 87-98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a stool validation set, sensitivity reached 66% (95% CI: 50-79) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 32% (95% CI: 14-57) for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 86-100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adding PHACTR3 methylation to FIT increased sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> up to 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PHACTR3 is a new hypermethylated gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with a good performance in stool DNA testing and has complementary value to FIT </plain></SENT>
