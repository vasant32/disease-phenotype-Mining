<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medicinal fungi has been used as adjuvants in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy due to its immunomodulatory and nutritional effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the metabolic and blood pressure effects on patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after dietary supplementation with Agaricus sylvaticus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The methodology used was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at the Base Hospital of the Federal District-Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples of 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, divided into two groups: Agaricus sylvaticus (30 mg/kg/day) and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three serum evaluations were conducted throughout the treatment: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, alkaline phosphatase; total, direct and indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase; immunoglobulins A (IgA), G (IgG) and M (IgM); total proteins and protein fractions; blood pressure levels were measured as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2003 and SPSS 14.0 programs, Student's t test, F statistical test, with p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Agaricus sylvaticus group presented a significant reduction of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p = 0.02), total cholesterol (p = 0.01), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (p = 0.05), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (p = 0.05), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.04), IgA (p = 0.0001), IgM (p = 0.02), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These alterations were not observed in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that dietary supplementation with Agaricus sylvaticus is capable of providing metabolic benefits to the biochemical, enzymatic and blood pressure parameters of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the postsurgical phase </plain></SENT>
