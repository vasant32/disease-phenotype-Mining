<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to test the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who had surgery with epidural anesthesia (EA) would have better outcome (either overall survival [OS] or recurrence-free survival [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>]) than those who were general anesthesia (GA), we performed this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By searching relevant literature, a total of 14 studies containing 18 sub-studies (seven in OS analysis and eleven in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> analysis) were identified and meta-analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For OS, the random-effects model was used to analyze the data and demonstrated an OS benefit in favor of EA compared with GA alone (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96, P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The influence analysis showed the robustness of the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, a significantly positive association between EA and improved OS was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.99, P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>, the random-effects model was used to analyze the data and no significant relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> benefit and EA (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.64-1.22, P = 0.457) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that epidural anesthesia and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> might be associated with improved overall survival in patients with operable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> undergoing surgery (especially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>), but it does not support an association between epidural anesthesia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to determine whether the association between epidural use and survival is causative </plain></SENT>
