<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: After curative treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), routine colonoscopies are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies of ethnic disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surveillance and examine any association between race/ethnicity and colonoscopy use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to address the association between race/ethnicity and colonoscopy use among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched Medline for relevant articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two authors reviewed titles, abstracts, and articles based on pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1,544 titles reviewed, eight studies published since 2001 investigated racial/ethnic disparities in colonoscopy use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four articles showed a small significant ethnic disparity in the receipt of timely colonoscopy, and the remaining four articles showed a nonsignificant trend in the same direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect did not vary by time of diagnosis or proportion of minorities in each study, though studies with larger samples showed somewhat greater racial/ethnic disparities in colonoscopy use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found at least a small disparity in the use of colonoscopy among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors, suggesting that ethnic disparities continue beyond prevention, detection, and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important to identify areas of unequal care in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivorship and to promote timely surveillance among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors who belong to racial/ethnic minorities to decrease disparities in mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CANCER</z:e> SURVIVORS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors who belong to racial/ethnic minorities may be less likely to receive follow-up colonoscopies on time, which could contribue to higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among minorities </plain></SENT>
