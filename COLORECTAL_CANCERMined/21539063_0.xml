<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that it can be prevented and cured when the diagnosis is made in early stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: For this reason it is necessary to apply a screening program in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Since 2003, we conducted a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening plan called "Mes del Colon" at Cl√≠nica Alemana Santiago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A press and local diffusion campaign was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Open to the community <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> talks were scheduled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An ad hoc database was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An informed consent was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients older than 50 years and high risk patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total colonoscopy and a medical interview after the procedure were included in the plan with favorable economic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Since 2003, 1158 patients were included The 1.8% of them were excluded because of incomplete data or because they did not meet the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 54% of patients were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 58.4 years old and mean body mass index 25.5 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Polipoid lesions were seen in 45% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six (1%) of them were <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, 291 (57%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (98% tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>), 189 (37%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> and 25 (5%) miscellaneous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this series, the necessary number to investigate for 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was 3.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention campaigns are needed due to the continuous increase of the incidence in our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The detection of precursor or early lesions that are longstanding before becoming <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> allows its treatment avoiding progression </plain></SENT>
