<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this trial was to determine the value of thymidylate synthase (TS), a key enzyme of DNA synthesis and target of 5-FU, to predict response to chemotherapy of mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> tissue was obtained from 168 patients with mCRC for relative thymidylate synthase (TS) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> quantitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised to receive either 5-FU/folinic acid (FA, FUFA) alone or in combination with irinotecan <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) stratified by TS (low versus high) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary end-point was overall response to first-line treatment among TS high patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parties, except for the randomisation centre, were blinded for TS status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biopsies (n=168) were taken without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TS levels were available for 147 patients (87.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysing response to FUFA and FOLFIRI in the per protocol set (n=119) after un-blinding TS in the data base revealed a trend to better overall response to FOLFIRI (9/19, 47%) in TS high compared to FUFA (5/23, 22%, p=0.077) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with biopsies taken from liver lesions (n=91) overall response to FOLFIRI and FUFA in TS high was 53% (9/17) and 18% (3/17), respectively (p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with low TS, no remarkable difference in overall response to FOLFIRI and FUFA was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taking a pre-treatment biopsy is a safe and feasible procedure in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After validation of our data in a larger group TS determination may have the potential to better help direct systemic treatment in patients with primarily non-resectable mCRC </plain></SENT>
