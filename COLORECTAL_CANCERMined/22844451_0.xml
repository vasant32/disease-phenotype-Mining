<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported gene expression signatures that predict recurrence risk in stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients with minimal gene membership overlap and undefined biological relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to investigate biological themes underlying these signatures, to infer genes of potential mechanistic importance to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence phenotype and to test whether accurate prognostic models can be developed using mechanistically important genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigated eight published <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> gene expression signatures and found no functional convergence in Gene Ontology enrichment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a random walk-based approach, we integrated these signatures and publicly available <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> data on a protein-protein interaction network and inferred 487 genes that were plausible candidate molecular underpinnings for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We named the list of 487 genes a NEM signature because it integrated information from Network, Expression, and Mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signature showed significant enrichment in four biological processes closely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> pathophysiology and provided good coverage of known oncogenes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A NEM signature-based Survival Support Vector Machine prognostic model was trained using a microarray gene expression dataset and tested on an independent dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model-based scores showed a 75.7% concordance with the real survival data and separated patients into two groups with significantly different relapse-free survival (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained with reversed training and testing datasets (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with prolonged survival of the high-risk patients (p = 0.006), but not beneficial to the low-risk patients (p = 0.491) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The NEM signature not only reflects <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biology but also informs patient prognosis and treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the network-based data integration method provides a convergence between biological relevance and clinical usefulness in gene signature development </plain></SENT>
