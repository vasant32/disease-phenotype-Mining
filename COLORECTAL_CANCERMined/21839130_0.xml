<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the expression and/or concentration of AM, its related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, adrenomedullin2/intermedin (AM2/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi>) and their receptors in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we assessed the correlation between the expression of AM and AM2/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi> with that of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a specific immunoradiometric assay, we found that AM concentrations were 2-11-fold higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues than in the surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression levels of preproAM (+548%), preproAM2/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi> (+2674%), calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) (+518%), receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP)2 (+281%), RAMP3 (+178%), VEGF-A (+277%) and MMP-9 (+864%) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues than in the surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, and there was a positive correlation between the gene expressions of MMP-9 and preproAM (r=0.352; p=0.005), but not with preproAM2/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi> (r=0.041, p=0.406) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both AM and AM2/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi> immunoreactivity were detected mainly within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, whereas MMP-9 immunoreactivity was mostly seen in the surrounding stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that AM produced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> acts in concert with MMP-9 in the stroma to contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
