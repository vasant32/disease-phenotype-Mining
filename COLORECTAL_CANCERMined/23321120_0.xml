<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methodology: We analyzed 197 CRC patients with elevated PreCA19-9 (&gt;=37U/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 were monitored postoperatively, according to standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IndexCEA and IndexCA19-9 were defined as the levels of CEA and CA19-9, respectively, recorded at recurrence confirmation or at the last follow-up of non-recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: There were 56 recurrences during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IndexCA19-9 (cut-off, 38.6U/mL) had better sensitivity (0.80 vs. 0.68) and specificity (0.87 vs. 0.83) than did IndexCEA (cut-off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2.8ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Area under the curve (AUC) analysis revealed that although IndexCA19-9 (0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.95) had better coverage than IndexCEA (0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.90), there was no significant difference (p=0.085) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the progressive rising of PreCA19-9 levels, we observed the trend of better AUC performance of IndexCA19-9 over IndexCEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a cut-off of 42U/mL for PreCA19-9, IndexCA19-9 began to have significantly better coverage than IndexCEA (p=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The surveillance advantage of CA19-9 over CEA was shown in the group of patients with preoperative CA19-9 levels &gt;42U/mL </plain></SENT>
