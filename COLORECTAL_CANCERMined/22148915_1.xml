<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported a urinary metabonomic profiling study on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subjects (n = 60) and health controls (n = 63), in which a panel of urinary metabolite markers was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a second urinary metabonomic study on a larger cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n = 101) and healthy subjects (n = 103), using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our previous findings, we observed a number of dysregulated metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cycle, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> cycle, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> metabolism, as well as gut microbial-host co-metabolism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirm distinct urinary metabolic footprints of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients characterized by altered levels of metabolites derived from gut microbial-host co-metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A panel of metabolite markers composed of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>, hippurate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17847">p-cresol</z:chebi>, 2-aminobutyrate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi>, and kynurenate was selected, which was able to discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subjects from their healthy counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis of these markers resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.993 and 0.998 for the training set and the testing set, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These potential metabolite markers provide a novel and promising molecular diagnostic approach for the early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
