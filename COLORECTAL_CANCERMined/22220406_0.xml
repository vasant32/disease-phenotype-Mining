<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased number of Tregs (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) were noticed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and/or regional lymph nodes lymphocytes (LNLs) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017185" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate the correlation between the percentage of Tregs in peripheral blood of patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, using flow cytometric technique and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages, classified as Dukes' A, B, C or D and by stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood venous samples were obtained from 92 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and from 30 healthy adult volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis: Linear regression equations were generated using a least-squares method and analyzed for differences of covariance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was calculated by Mann Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data has shown that 15% patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were classified as Dukes' A, 41% were Dukes' B, 35% were Dukes' C and 9% were Dukes' D </plain></SENT>
