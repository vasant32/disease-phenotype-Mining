<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our further aim was to determine the proliferative activity of intraepithelial α-SMA(+) cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slides immunostained for Ki-67, α-SMA, E-cadherin and pan-cytokeratin were digitalized and analyzed by using a digital microscope software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of α-SMA(+)/CK(+) cells was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples (3.34 ± 1.01%) compared to healthy (1.94 ± 0.69%) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (1.62 ± 0.78%) samples (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E-cadherin expression negatively correlated with the number of α-SMA(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of intraepithelial α-SMA(+) cells were in the proliferative phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, the appearance of dot-like α-SMA staining in CK positive cells may indicate the initial phase of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high proportion of intraepithelial α-SMA(+) proliferating cells may refer to their increased plasticity compared to differentiated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The negative correlation between E-cadherin and intraepithelial α-SMA expression suggests that EMT is facilitated by a loss of epithelial cell contact </plain></SENT>
