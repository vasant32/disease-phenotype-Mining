<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific interacting factors that influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> morbidity have yet to be fully investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multi-institutional collaborative study with 1511 CRC patients and 2098 control subjects was used to compare the odds ratios for the occurrence of polymorphisms at 11 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TaqMan PCR and questionnaires were used to evaluate the effects of environmental exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variants of rs6983267 on 8q24 were the most significant markers of risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.27, P = 0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100651'>insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), a higher body mass index at age 20, and meat consumption were environmental risk factors, whereas a tuna-rich diet and vitamin intake were protective factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cohort of rs6983267 SNP major (T) allele at 8q24 and DM had a 1.66-fold higher risk ratio than the cohort of major allele patients without DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that interactions between the genetic background and environmental factors are associated with increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a robust risk of the minor G allele at the 8q24 rs6983267 SNP; however, a major T allele SNP could more clearly reveal a correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specifically when DM is present </plain></SENT>
