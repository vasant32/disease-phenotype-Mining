<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transcription factor A (mtTFA) preferentially recognizes <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>-damaged DNA via physical interaction with p53 and is upregulated by treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and fluorouracil (5-FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether expression of mtTFA predicts the clinical outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 6 (mFOLFOX6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine patients with metastatic lesions from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with mFOLFOX6 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 25 women and 34 men with a median age of 62 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (85 mg/m(2) ) plus leucovorin (200 mg/m(2) ) as a 2-h infusion on day 1, followed by 5-FU (400 mg/m(2) ) bolus and 46-h continuous infusion of 2400 mg/m(2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of mtTFA and p53 of resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> were examined by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 59 patients, 33 (complete response 1, partial response 32) achieved a confirmed response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive cytoplasmic staining rate for mtTFA was 44.1% and that for p53 was 59.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strong expression of mtTFA was detected in eight of 33 complete response/partial response (24.2%) and in 18 of 26 SD/PD (69.2%), indicating that mtTFA expression was significantly correlated with response to chemotherapy (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was significantly longer in patients without mtTFA expression (P=0.0493) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that mtTFA expression significantly affected overall survival (hazard ratio 2.10, P=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study of mtTFA may be useful for predicting the clinical outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with FOLFOX </plain></SENT>
