<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CRCCP grantees must use evidence-based strategies from the Guide to Community Preventive Services, including small media and client reminders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess the existing resources and needs to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, we conducted 2 web-based surveys of CRCCP grantees and their community partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survey 1 sought to identify priority populations, the number and quality of existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resources for different population subgroups, and the types of small media and client reminder they were most interested in using </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survey 2 assessed screening messages that were used in the past or might be used in the future, needs for non-English-language information, and preferences for screening-related terminology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In survey 1 (n = 125 from 26 CRCCPs), most respondents (83%) indicated they currently had some information resources for promoting screening but were widely dissatisfied with the quality and number of these resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They reported the greatest need for resources targeting rural populations (62% of respondents), men (53%), and Hispanics (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In survey 2 (n = 57 from 25 CRCCPs), respondents indicated they were most likely to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening using messages that emphasized family (95%), role models (85%), or busy lives (83%), and least likely to use messages based on faith (26%), embarrassment (25%), or fear (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (85%) indicated a need for resources in languages other than English; 16 different languages were mentioned, most commonly Spanish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings provide the first picture of CRCCP information resources and interests, and point to specific gaps that must be addressed to help increase screening </plain></SENT>
