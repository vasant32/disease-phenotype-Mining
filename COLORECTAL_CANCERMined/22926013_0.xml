<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether physician-related factors influenced patient participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening programs and to identify patient characteristics associated with lower participation in order to facilitate the development of targeted actions to improve participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a French department during its first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening campaign from June 2007 to May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data for 157,766 patients followed by 903 general practitioners (GPs) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient participation was assessed using multilevel logistic modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall participation rate was 30% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 29.8-30.2) and varied across the 903 GPs from 0% to 75.5% (median, 30; interquartile range, 24-35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inter-GP variance explained only 5.5% of the participation rate variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participation was significantly lower in males (odds ratio [OR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.78-0.91), the youngest age group (55-59 years, OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.58-0.63), and patients living in socioeconomically deprived areas (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77-0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Targeted actions to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening participation should focus on patients younger than 60 years, males, and individuals living in deprived areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actions to enhance the influence of GPs on patient participation should be directed to the overall population of GPs </plain></SENT>
