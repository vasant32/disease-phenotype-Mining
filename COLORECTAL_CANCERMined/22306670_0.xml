<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, K-ras mutation testing has become mandatory in hospitals offering such treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the performance and reagent costs of 2 sensitive methods for detection of K-ras mutations: a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48021">peptide nucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) clamp polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and a commercially available amplification refractory mutation system/Scorpion (ARMS/S) PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both methods were applied in parallel to 101 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> clamp PCR assay detected K-ras mutations in 35% (35 of 101) of the samples, whereas the ARMS/S PCR assay detected mutations in 27% (27 of 101) of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was 92% (93 of 101) concordance between the 2 methods and the Îº coefficient for the comparison was 0.82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 8 discordant cases were exclusively positive by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> clamp PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the reagent costs of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> clamp PCR assay were estimated to be at least 20 times lower than the ARMS/S assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the high performance and low costs associated with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> clamp PCR assay encourage its use in the administration of personalized epidermal growth factor receptor-directed therapy </plain></SENT>
