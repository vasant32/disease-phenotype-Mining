<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the identification of CK19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as an optimal marker and its cut-off value for use in the detection of one-step nucleic acid amplification-based lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Candidate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> markers selected from the genome-wide expressed sequence tag database were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR using a mixture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-positive and another mixture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-negative lymph nodes (n = 5 each), followed by quantitative RT-PCR using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-positive and -negative lymph nodes (n = 10 each) from 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The one-step nucleic acid amplification assay for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> markers selected above was examined using 28 positive lymph nodes from 19 patients and 38 negative lymph nodes from the 11 pN0 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the 98 mRNAs selected from the genome-wide expressed sequence tag database and the subsequent quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the nine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> selected above indicated that CK19 and CEA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> have the highest capability for distinguishing between positive and negative lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CK19, CEA and CK20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were evaluated by the one-step nucleic acid amplification assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An area under a receiver-operating-characteristic curve for CK19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (0.999) was slightly larger than that for CEA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (0.946; P = 0.062) and significantly larger that than for CK20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (0.875; P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that CK19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> has the best diagnostic performance and its cut-off value for discriminating positive from negative lymph nodes can be set in the range of 75-500 copies/Âµl with 96.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity </plain></SENT>
