<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Heterocyclic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> (HAA) are animal carcinogens that are present in meat cooked at high temperature and in tobacco smoke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These compounds require activation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> 1A2 (CYP1A2) and N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) before they can damage DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study tested the hypotheses that well-done meat and cigarette smoking increase the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, the precursor to most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, especially in individuals with rapid CYP1A2 and rapid NAT2 activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: An endoscopy-based case-control study of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was conducted among Caucasians, Japanese and native Hawaiians to test this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall diet and consumption of well-done meat cooked by various high-temperature methods were assessed by interview in 1016 patients with a first <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 1355 controls with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> test was used to assess CYP1A2 and NAT2 activities in 635 cases and 845 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to account for matching factors and potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Smoking was associated with an increased risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Weak non-significant elevated OR were observed for the main effects of HAA intakes or NAT2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the combined effects of HAA intakes and NAT2 activity were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects in both the upper tertiles of NAT2 activity and HAA intake were at increased risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> compared with subjects in the lower tertiles of NAT2 activity and exposure (2-amino-3,4,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36616">quinoxaline</z:chebi> intake OR 1.70, 95% CI I 1.06 to 2.75; 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36616">quinoxaline</z:chebi> intake OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.16; and 2-amino-1-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16227">pyridine</z:chebi> intake OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data suggest that rapid N-acetylators with high HAA intake may be at increased risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
