<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews of 15 GPs and 11 specialists investigating views on the proposed introduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both GPs and specialists in this study, whilst agreeing on the overall merit of a population screening programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in New Zealand, argued that there were not sufficient resources to warrant the implementation of such a programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also little support, especially by the GPs, for the faecal occult blood test, which is likely to be the screening test if implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The concerns of GPs and specialists need to be addressed if a screening programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is introduced in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GPs undoubtedly would have to be the advocates of this programme to their patients and therefore they will have to be convinced of the value of this exercise </plain></SENT>
