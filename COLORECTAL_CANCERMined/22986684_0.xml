<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>.RESULTS:A total of 935 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both measures of general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (measured by BMI) and central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> (measured by WHR and WC) were significantly associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in men but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable-adjusted HRs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in men in the highest compared with the lowest quintiles were 2.15 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-3.43; P for trend=0.0006) for BMI, 1.97 (95% CI: 1.19-3.24; P for trend=0.0004) for WHR and 2.00 (95% CI: 1.21-3.29; P for trend=0.0002) for WC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BMI-associated risk was attenuated in analyses stratified by WHR, whereas the WHR-associated risk remained significant in the high BMI stratum (HR for comparison of extreme tertiles of WHR: 3.38, 95% CI: 1.47-7.75; P for trend =0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of these anthropometric measures were significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>.CONCLUSION:<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, particularly central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in men.International Journal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> advance online publication, 18 September 2012; doi:10.1038/ijo.2012.152 </plain></SENT>
