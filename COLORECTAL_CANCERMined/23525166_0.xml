<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Telomeres are essential for chromosomal stability and integrity, protecting the ends of chromosomes from degradation and preventing chromosomal end fusions and recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A loss of telomere function is a major mechanism for the generation of chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere shortening leads to mutations, chromosome rearrangements and translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colorectal laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (LSTs) are a special type of superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They are considered to have a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to characterize the expression of hTERT in an LST cell line and paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was utilized to examine the protein expression of hTERT in the LST cell line, 48 resected LSTs, 48 protruded-type colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (PAs) and 48 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were applied to test the associations between hTERT expression and clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that the positive expression levels of hTERT in LSTs, PAs and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa were 60.4, 22.9 and 10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with polypi and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, the expression levels of hTERT were significantly increased in LSTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of hTERT was also observed in the LST cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression of hTERT was significantly higher in LSTs, which may indicate a potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
