<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of the main changes of the current TNM-7 is the elimination of the category MX, since it has been a source of ambiguity and misinterpretation, especially by pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore the ultimate staging would be better performed by the patient's clinician who can classify the disease M0 (no distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>) or M1 (presence of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>), having access to the completeness of data resulting from clinical examination, imaging workup and pathology report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However this important change doesn't take into account the diagnostic value and the challenge of small indeterminate visceral lesions encountered, in particular, during radiological staging of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article the diagnosis of these lesions with multiple imaging modalities, their frequency, significance and relevance to staging and disease management are described in a multidisciplinary way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular the interplay between clinical, radiological and pathological staging, which are usually conducted independently, is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The integrated approach shows that there are both advantages and disadvantages to abandoning the MX category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To avoid ambiguity arising both by applying and interpreting MX category for stage assigning, its abandoning seems reasonable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recognition of the importance of small lesion characterization raises the need for applying a separate category; therefore a proposal for their categorization is put forward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By using the proposed categorization the lack of consideration for indeterminate visceral lesions with the current staging system will be overcome, also optimizing tailored follow-up </plain></SENT>
