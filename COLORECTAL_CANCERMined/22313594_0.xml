<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is inevitably affected by the number of removed lymph nodes, but lymph node ratio can be unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the value of lymph node ratio in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathologic factors and follow-up data of 145 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 1998 and December 2008 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses were used to determine the correlation coefficient, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival, and the Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for multivariate analysis in forward stepwise regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that lymph node ratio was not correlated with the number of removed lymph nodes (r = -0.154, P = 0.065), but it was positively correlated with the number of positive lymph nodes (r = 0.739, P &lt; 0.001) and N stage (r = 0.695, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> configuration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo>, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration, T stage, N stage, and lymph node ratio were associated with disease-free survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that serum CEA concentration, T stage, and lymph node ratio were prognostic factors for disease-free survival (P &lt; 0.05), whereas N stage failed to achieve significance (P = 0.664) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that lymph node ratio was a prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> and had a better prognostic value than did N stage </plain></SENT>
