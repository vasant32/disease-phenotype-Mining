<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: to provide up-to-date information and to analyze recent changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality trends in Andalusia during the period of 1980-2008 using joinpoint regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: age- and sex-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were taken from the official vital statistics published by the Instituto de Estadística de Andalucía for the years 1980 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We computed age-specific rates for each 5-year age group and calendar year and age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A joinpoint regression analysis was used for trend analysis of standardized rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify the years when a significant change in the linear slope of the temporal trend occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best fitting points (the "join-points") are chosen where the rate significantly changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Andalusia during the period studied has increased, from 277 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 1980 to 1,227 in 2008 in men, and from 333 to 805 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality rates increased from 7.7 to 17.0 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 100,000 person-years in men and from 6.6 to 9.0 per 100,000 person-years in women Changes in mortality did not evolve similarly for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality rates are lower in women than in men, which imply that women reach comparable levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality at higher ages than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: sex differences for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality have been widening in the last decade in Andalusia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In spite of the decreasing trends in age-adjusted mortality rates in women, incidence rates and the absolute numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> are still increasing, largely because of the aging of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> still has a large impact on health care services, and this impact will continue to increase for many more years </plain></SENT>
