<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: There is currently no routine collection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stages in population-based data in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the accuracy of International classification of diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) codes for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> recorded in hospital morbidity data to assign spread of disease at diagnosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The reference (gold) standard was the Australian clinicopathological stage (ACPS) documented by a treating colorectal surgeon and derived from histopathology and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To allow comparison with stages derived from the hospital morbidity data (HMD), ACPS was mapped to the spread of disease (local, regional and distant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity and positive-predictive values were calculated to compare the accuracy of stage derived from HMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from both the reference standard and HMD were available for 499 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HMD slightly overestimated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> (62.3 vs 56.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a corresponding underestimation of regional and distant spread of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While sensitivity for regional and distant disease was moderate (66.4 and 71.4%, respectively), specificity was high (92.7 and 96.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> codes for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in HMD are limited in their utility for determining the spread of disease for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians need to ensure that clinical coders are provided with enough information to accurately code for spread of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend reporting histopathology in a synoptic format which includes background information on the presence or absence of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
