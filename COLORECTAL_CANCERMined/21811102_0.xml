<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found three potential binding sites of Snail, a key transcriptional factor involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in the region of PRL-3 promoter (located at -642 to -383) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results showed that one of the Snail binding sites (located at -624 to -619) was the key element to maintain promoter activity of human PRL-3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional activity of PRL-3 promoter was abolished after the Snail binding site (located at -624 to -619) was mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both promoter activity and protein expression of PRL-3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines could be regulated by Snail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In clinical samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and metastatic lymph node of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, expression of PRL-3 protein was correlated with expression of Snail protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional studies using gene over-expression and knockdown methods indicated that Snail promoted proliferation, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SW480 cells with PRL-3 stable knockdown, cell proliferation increased after Snail was up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data first reveal transcriptional factor Snail as a key regulator of PRL-3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The link between Snail and PRL-3 suggests a new potential mechanism of Snail contributing to progression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
