<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is a risk factor for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; however, risk differences for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between African Americans and Caucasians with UC are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cohort study of patients with a diagnosis of UC during fiscal years 1998 to 2009 using the national Veterans Affairs administrative datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates and incidence rate ratios were calculated and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between race and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort comprised of 20,949 patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 168 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified during 112,243 patient-years (PY) of follow-up; overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rate was 163/100,000 PY (95% confidence interval [CI] 139-187/100,000 PY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates were 158/100,000 PY (95% CI 134-181/100,000 PY) and 180/100,000 PY (95% CI 155-205/100,000 PY) in Caucasians and African Americans, respectively, with an incidence rate ratio of 1.17 (95% CI 0.69-1.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3, 5, and 10-year cumulative incidence rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 0.36%, 0.76%, 1.79% for African Americans and 0.41%, 0.76%, 1.43% for Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>African Americans were not at an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.10, 95% CI 0.65-1.87) compared to Caucasians </plain></SENT>
