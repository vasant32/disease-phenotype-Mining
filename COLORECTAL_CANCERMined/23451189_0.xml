<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we examined the effectiveness of a combination treatment regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild type</z:mp> HCT116 cells and HCT116+ch3 cells (complemented with chromosome 3) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> and 5-FU in a time- and dose-dependent manner and evaluated by cell proliferation assays, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> staining, transmission electron microscopy, cell cycle analysis and immunoblotting for key signaling proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The individual IC50 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> and 5-FU were approximately 20 µM and 5 µM in HCT116 cells and 5 µM and 1 µM in HCT116+ch3 cells, respectively (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> significantly reduced survival in both cells; HCT116+ch3 cells were considerably more sensitive to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> and/or 5-FU than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IC50 values for combination treatment were approximately 5 µM and 1 µM in HCT116 and 5 µM and 0.1 µM in HCT116+ch3, respectively (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both cells by inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> degeneration and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis revealed that the anti-proliferative effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> and/or 5-FU was preceded by accumulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in the S cell cycle phase and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> potentiated 5-FU-induced expression or cleavage of pro-apoptotic proteins (caspase-8, -9, -3, PARP and Bax), and down-regulated anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xL) and proliferative (cyclin D1) proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although 5-FU activated NF-κB/PI-3K/Src pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, this was down-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment through inhibition of IκBα kinase activation and IκBα phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> with conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-FU could provide more effective treatment strategies against chemoresistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms involved may be mediated via NF-κB/PI-3K/Src pathways and NF-κB regulated gene products </plain></SENT>
