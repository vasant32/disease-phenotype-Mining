<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathology (other/tub1, 2), the proportion of neutrophils and lymphocytes, serum level of C-reactive protein and albumin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> volume were associated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis using these seven selected features disclosed that only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathology was associated with the overall survival (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
