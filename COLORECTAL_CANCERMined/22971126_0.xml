<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To that end, indicators of the quality of initial treatment delivered to newly-diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in a North-Western Region of Italy, were investigated using administrative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cohort includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (N = 24,187) selected by a validated algorithm from the Piedmont Hospital Discharge Record system over an 8-year period (2000-2007).Three indicators of quality of care in this population-based cohort were evaluated: the proportion of preoperative radiotherapy (RT) and of abdominoperineal (AP) resection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients, and the proportion of postoperative in-hospital mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e>, older patients were less likely to have preoperative RT, and more likely to receive an AP resection compared to younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of undergoing preoperative RT and AP resection was reduced in females compared to males (odds ratio (OR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.93 and OR 0.78, 95%CI 0.69-0.89, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was a trend of increasing RT over time (p for trend &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of undergoing AP resection was increased in less-educated patients and in hospitals with a low caseload.A higher risk of postoperative in-hospital mortality was found among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who were older, male, (female versus male OR 0.71, 95%CI 0.60-0.84), unmarried (OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.09-1.59) or with unknown marital status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence of the importance of social, clinical and hospital characteristics on the equity and quality of care in a Southern European country with an open-access public health care system </plain></SENT>
