<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There were 2 objectives: first, to investigate how many patients were excluded from surgery on the basis of the radiological extent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) or the clinical examination; and second, to develop a score based primarily on serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers (STMs) that could predict short <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (&lt;12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patient selection and prediction of prognosis is crucial for successful treatment of colorectal PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with colorectal PC referred for cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (2005-2008) at Uppsala University hospital were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups-nonsurgery and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological and laboratory parameters were collected in the surgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Corep (COloREctal-Pc) score was developed using hazard ratios from histology, hematological status, serial serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers (STMs), and STM changes over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive predicted value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>), and negative predicted value (NPV) were calculated in a second validating dataset (n = 24) with a survival cutoff of less than 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were included in the study, 42 in the nonsurgery group and 65 in the surgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the nonsurgery group, 2 patients were excluded solely on the basis of the radiological extent of PC and 7 patients on clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Corep score ranged from 0 to 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A score of 6 or more showed a validated sensitivity of 80%, specificity 100%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 1.0, and NPV 0.93 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiological extent of PC was not a main deciding factor for treatment decisions and had less impact than the clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Corep score identified patients with short <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival that may not be suitable for treatment </plain></SENT>
