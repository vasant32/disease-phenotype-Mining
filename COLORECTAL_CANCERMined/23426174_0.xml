<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported that 8-c [6-(2-(2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino)ethylamino)-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25657">octyl</z:chebi>-1H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36677">benzo[de]isoquinoline</z:chebi>-1,3(2H)-dione], a novel amonafide analogue, was generated as a new anticancer candidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about its activity in chemoresistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the antitumor effects of 8-c on the multi-drug-resistant human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines HCT-116/L-OHP and HCT-8/VCR have been investigated for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>8-c showed similar concentration-dependent inhibitory activities against multi-drug-resistant cells and corresponding parental cell lines by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay after 48 h of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>8-c treatment resulted in the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as evidenced by fluorescent staining analysis, comet assay data, and the increase in the number of apoptotic cells as detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot, qPCR, and siRNA techniques were used to elucidate the molecular mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggested that the apoptotic effect of 8-c can be attributed to the upregulation of p53, caspase-3, and cleaved poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) and the downregulation of Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ERCC1 is essential for nucleotide excision repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ERCC1 expression was correlated with sensitivity to chemotherapy in various <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is intriguing that decreases in ERCC1 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were also observed in the HCT-116/L-OHP and HCT-8/VCR cells after exposure to 8-c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further transient transfection of multi-drug-resistant cells with ERCC1 siRNA enhanced 8-c-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, epidermal growth factor-induced increase in ERCC1 protein levels was shown to rescue cell viability upon 8-c treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that 8-c has a strong potential to be developed as a new antitumor agent for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, and is worthy of further studies </plain></SENT>
