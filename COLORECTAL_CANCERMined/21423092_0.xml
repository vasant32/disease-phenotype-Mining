<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue of patients surgically treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between July 2005 and July 2009 were stored in a tissue bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These samples were studied with the technique of real-time polymerase chain reaction in respect to expression of the following genes: KRAS codon 12 mutation, TACSTD2, Ku70, and SERIN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> samples of 37 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 65.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty one patients (56.8%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (24.3%) were classified as TNM stage I, 11 patients (29.8%) as TNM stage II, eight patients (21.6%) as TNM stage III and nine patients (24.3%) as TNM stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Ku70 expression in poorly-differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is significantly higher than in well and moderately-differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (2.76 vs. 1.13; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SERIN1, TACSTD2 and KRAS codon 12 mutation are not associated with clinical-pathological characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ku70 expression in poorly-differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is significantly higher than in well and moderately-differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
