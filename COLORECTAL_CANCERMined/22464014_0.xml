<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of anti-proliferative mechanism of triptolide in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells is not entirely clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Triptolide markedly inhibited HT29 and SW480 cells proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Triptolide decreased ERK and AKT phosphorylation, and GABPÎ± expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beta-catenin expression and phosphorylation were not altered by incubation of triptolide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we found that triptolide repressed expression of LEF/TCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although it did not significantly affect cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, triptolide induced G1 phase arrest dose-dependently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further detection for the expression of cell cycle-related proteins suggesting that triptolide stimulate expression of p21 and repress cyclin A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased p21 binded to CDK4/CDK6, therefore blocked function of CDK4/CDK6, and subsequently contribute to the G1 arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that triptolide is a potential agent for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and its anti-proliferation effect mainly occur through G1 phase arrest </plain></SENT>
