<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is primarily expressed in the proliferative zone of the mammalian intestinal epithelium, where it regulates cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies showed that inhibition of KLF5 expression reduces proliferation rates in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumor</z:e> formation in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify chemical probes that decrease levels of KLF5, we used cell-based ultrahigh-throughput screening (uHTS) to test compounds in the public domain of NIH, the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary screen involved luciferase assays in the DLD-1/pGL4.18hKLF5p cell line, which stably expressed a luciferase reporter driven by the human KLF5 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cytotoxicity counterscreen was done in the rat intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 97 KLF5-selective compounds with EC(50) &lt; 10 μmol/L for KLF5 inhibition and EC(50) &gt; 10 μmol/L for IEC-6 cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two most potent compounds, CIDs (PubChem Compound IDs) 439501 and 5951923, were further characterized on the basis of computational, Western blot, and cell viability analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both of these compounds, and two newly synthesized structural analogs of CID 5951923, significantly reduced endogenous KLF5 protein levels and decreased viability of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines without any apparent impact on IEC-6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, when tested in the NCI-60 panel of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, compound CID 5951923 was selectively active against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show the feasibility of uHTS in identifying novel compounds that inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell proliferation by targeting KLF5 </plain></SENT>
