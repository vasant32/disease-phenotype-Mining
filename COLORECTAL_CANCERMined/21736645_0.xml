<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In recent years, therapeutic approaches including cytoreductive surgery followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy have proven effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> of colorectal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If cytology is to be used to include patients in aggressive treatment regimens, it is necessary to evaluate its performance, particularly in terms of specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess interobserver agreement for the detection of intraperitoneal free <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells (IFCCs) in patients with non-gynaecological <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 5-year period, 1223 patients were recruited in 19 French surgery departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peritoneal samples were examined in 14 dispersed pathology laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Giemsa-stained slides were sent to a control reader blind to the previous diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discordant cases, concordant positive results and a random selection of negative concordant cases were reviewed by a panel of seven cytopathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 'final diagnosis' was that of the consensus meetings but took into account locally-processed slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gathering dubious cases with negative results, a 95.6% concordance was achieved between local readers and the control reader </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IFCCs were ascertained by the panel in 85 cases (7.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight of 873 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> cases viewed locally were falsely positive (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy and neoadjuvant therapy had no impact on the false-positive rate as assessed by final validation by the panel (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Samples initially considered as dubious were reclassified as negative by the panel in 24 of 25 cases (96.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The panel consensus allowed reclassification of most dubious/equivocal peritoneal cytology cases, whereas clearcut distinction between benign and malignant cases was correctly achieved in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
