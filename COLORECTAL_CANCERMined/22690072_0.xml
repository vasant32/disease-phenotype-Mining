<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines HT29 and SW480 were treated with nigericin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> under the conditions specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell viability assay and invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> assay were performed to evaluate the effect of nigericin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sphere-forming assay and soft agar colony-forming assay were implemented to assess the action of nigericin on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell properties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, nigericin showed more toxicity for the HT29 cell line (IC50, 12.92 ± 0.25 μmol vs 37.68 ± 0.34 μmol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar result was also obtained with the SW116 cell line (IC50, 15.86 ± 0.18 μmol vs 41.02 ± 0.23 μmol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Boyden chamber assay indicated that a significant decrease in the number of HT29 cells migrating through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53250">polyvinylidene fluoride</z:chebi> membrane was observed in the nigericin-treated group, relative to the vehicle-treated group [11 ± 2 cells per high-power field (HPF) vs 19.33 ± 1.52 cells per HPF, P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the control group, the numbers of HT29 cells invading through the Matrigel-coated membrane also decreased in the nigericin-treated group (6.66 ± 1.52 cells per HPF vs 14.66 ± 1.52 cells per HPF, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nigericin also reduced the proportion of CD133+ cells from 83.57% to 63.93%, relative to the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nigericin decreased the number of spheres relative to the control group (0.14 ± 0.01 vs 0.35 ± 0.01, P &lt; 0.05), while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> increased the number of spheres relative to the control group (0.75 ± 0.02 vs 0.35 ± 0.01; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nigericin also showed a decreased ability to form colonies under anchorage-independent conditions in a standard soft agar assay after 14 d in culture, relative to the control group (1.66 ± 0.57 vs 7 ± 1.15, P &lt; 0.05), whereas the colony numbers were higher in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> group relative to the vehicle-treated controls (14.33 ± 0.57 vs 7 ± 1.15, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We further detected the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin in cells treated with nigericin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results showed that HT29 cells treated with nigericin induced an increase in E-cadherin expression and a decrease in the vimentin expression relative to vehicle controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> downregulated the expression of E-cadherin and upregulated the expression of vimentin in HT29 cells relative to vehicle controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that nigericin could partly reverse the EMT process during cell invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
