<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to characterize the effect of the primary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi>) upon(14) C-BT uptake in tumoral (Caco-2) and non-tumoral (IEC-6) intestinal epithelial cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 2-day exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi> markedly and concentration-dependently inhibited (14) C-BT uptake by IEC-6 cells (IC(50) = 120 µM), and, less potently, by Caco-2 cells (IC(50) = 402 µM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi> upon (14) C-BT uptake did not result from a decrease in cell proliferation or viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In IEC-6 cells: (1) uptake of (14) C-BT involves both a high-affinity and a low-affinity transporter, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi> acted as a competitive inhibitor of the high-affinity transporter; (2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi> inhibited both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-coupled monocarboxylate cotransporter 1 (SMCT1)- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi>-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated uptake of (14) C-BT; (3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi> significantly increased the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level of SMCT1; (4) inhibition of (14) C-BT uptake by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi> was dependent on CaM, MAP kinase (ERK1/2 and p38 pathways), and PKC activation, and reduced by a reactive oxygen species scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, BT (5 mM) decreased IEC-6 cell viability and increased IEC-6 cell differentiation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi> (100 µM) reduced this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi> is an effective inhibitor of (14) C-BT uptake in tumoral and non-tumoral intestinal epithelial cells, through inhibition of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> -coupled MCT1- and SMCT1-mediated transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the role played by BT in the intestine, this mechanism may contribute to the procarcinogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">CDCA</z:chebi> at this level </plain></SENT>
