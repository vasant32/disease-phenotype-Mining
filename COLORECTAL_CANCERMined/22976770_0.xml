<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect test-specific barriers have on colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) completion, what rationales are given for non-completion, and what "switch" patterns exist when participants are allowed to switch from one test to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low income adults who were not up-to-date with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines were recruited from safety-net clinics and offered colonoscopy or FIT (n = 418) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow up telephone surveys assessed test-specific barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Test completion was determined from patient medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For subjects who desired colonoscopy at baseline, finding a time to come in and transportation applied more to non-completers than completers (p = 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For participants who initially wanted FIT, keeping track of cards, never putting stool on cards, and not remembering to mail cards back applied more to non-completers than completers (p = 0.003, p = 0.006, and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common rationale given for not completing screening was a desire for the other screening modality: 7 % of patients who initially preferred screening by FIT completed colonoscopy, while 8 % of patients who initially preferred screening by colonoscopy completed FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that test-specific barriers apply more to subjects who did not complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a common rationale for test non-completion is a desire to receive a different screening modality, our findings suggest screening rates could be increased by giving patients the opportunity to switch tests after an initial choice is made </plain></SENT>
