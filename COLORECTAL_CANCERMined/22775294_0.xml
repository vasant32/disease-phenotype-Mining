<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Targeted health messages may help increase healthy behaviors among vulnerable groups such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using findings from focus groups with <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women, the authors created targeted messages to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and physical activity among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The messages addressed psychosocial constructs, such as benefits and barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and exercise, which were relevant to the target population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Messages were tested online with women age 50 years and older (N = 181) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants were stratified by weight (<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> vs. nonobese) and randomized to review either 10 targeted (intervention) or 10 generic (control) messages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Study outcomes included elaboration about the messages, message relevance and trustworthiness, and behavioral intentions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors used moderation and subgroup analyses to determine whether the intervention messages were better received by certain women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They found no differences in elaboration, behavioral intentions, relevance, or trustworthiness between intervention and control for either weight group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, exercise intentions increased more (p = .06) among inactive <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women who received intervention messages (+2.9) compared with those who were in the control group (+1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intervention messages also produced more elaboration among women who viewed their weight as a barrier to screening or exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tailoring intervention messages for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women on the basis of behavior and barriers may improve outcomes more than giving the same messages to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
