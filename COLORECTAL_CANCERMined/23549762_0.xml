<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little information has been available concerning the safety of laparoscopic resection of obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after transanal endoscopic tube decompression (TETD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic surgery following TETD for such advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 40 patients with obstructive left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> whose distended bowels were treated with TETD before laparoscopic surgery, between January 2001 and March 2011 (TETD group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elective surgery resulted in potentially curative resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their clinical records were compared to those of 80 matched controls with nonobstructive left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resected laparoscopically during the same period (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative time, blood loss, and the rate of conversion to laparotomy were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant between-group differences in morbidity rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival rates in the TETD and control groups were 71.9 and 75.4 %, respectively, with no statistical difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival rates after 5 years were also similar (TETD group, 64.5 % vs. control group, 66.3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the two groups in recurrence rates and patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that laparoscopic surgery following TETD is clinically and oncologically safe and could be a treatment of choice for obstructive left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
