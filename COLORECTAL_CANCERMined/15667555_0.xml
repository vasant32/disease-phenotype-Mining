<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the data for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients in the CD group were collected by registration through a cohort study, and the patients in the MS group were selected from mass screening of a natural population of 19 852 in Beijing Metropolitan area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was confirmed pathologically in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients over the age of 50 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> comprised 81.9% of the CD group and 83.3% of the MS group; the percentage of Dukes A + B was 41.1% and 91.7%, respectively; 0.28% of individuals with risk factors in the MS group were found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, whereas 0.05% did not (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically, 44.7% of the protruding type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were Dukes A or B compared with only 10% of the ulcerated type (chi(2) = 22.304, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positivity rate of the fecal occult blood (FOB) test was 79.9% in Dukes A + B and 82.0% in Dukes C + D, showing no difference between the FOB test and Dukes staging in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (chi(2) = 0.087, P = 0.768) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen in Dukes C + D was significantly higher than that in Dukes A + B (chi(2) = 5.547, P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the moderately and well-differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 51.8% (159/307) were Dukes A + B, resulting in a significant difference (chi(2) = 14.504, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in 17.9% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and 14.6% of their first-degree relatives suffered from <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Beijing Metropolitan area has been rising significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The staging and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> involves symptomatology, laboratory tests, endoscopic findings and pathologic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mass screening is effective for detecting early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in China </plain></SENT>
