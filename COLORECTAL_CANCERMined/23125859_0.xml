<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to determine whether relationships exist between the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and examine whether the risk is modified by level of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS were searched to May 2012 using the terms "<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>," "<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>," "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>," "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase," "MTHFR." Observational studies were included which (1) assessed the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for each polymorphism and/or (2) had defined levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake for each polymorphism and assessed the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From 910 references, 67 studies met our criteria; hand searching yielded 10 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The summary risk estimate comparing the 677CT versus CC genotype was 1.02 (95% CI 0.95-1.10) and for 677TT versus CC was 0.88 (95% CI 0.80-0.96) both with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The summary risk estimates for A1298C polymorphisms suggested no reduced risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The summary risk estimate for high versus low total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> for the 677CC genotype was 0.70 (95% CI 0.56-0.89) and the 677TT genotype 0.63 (95% CI 0.41-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the 677TT genotype is associated with a reduced risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, under conditions of high total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake, and this associated risk remains reduced for both MTHFR 677 CC and TT genotypes </plain></SENT>
