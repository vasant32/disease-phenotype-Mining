<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> were treated with CHIPC guided by B-mode ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>Ascites</z:hpo> were originally from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> (11 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (10 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (9 cases) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CHIPC was carried out at 43˚C for 90 min with 0.9% saline solution as a carrier containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin-C</z:chebi> as therapeutic reagents depending on the type of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic efficacy, postoperative complications and survival period of these patients were assessed with follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The KPS scores were elevated by 23.1±9.0 after 3 sessions of ultrasound guided CHIPC and the quality of life (QOF) of patients was significantly improved (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 9 months and 18 patients survived between 3 and 30 months after CHIPC treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A novel approach of using B ultrasound guided CHIPC for the treatment of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> demonstrated satisfactory outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The approach shows benefit in minimizing invasive surgery, improving the patient QOF and prolonging survival time </plain></SENT>
