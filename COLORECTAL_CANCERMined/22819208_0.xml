<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this investigation was the validation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure sVEGFR-3 in human plasma and the investigation of its applicability in clinical trials as first step of the biomarker validation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>General validation criteria were assessed based on current guidelines and recommendations for immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ELISA was applied in two clinical trials including healthy volunteers and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients receiving 50 or 37.5mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> per day, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SVEGFR-3 was measured at predefined time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Undiluted, inactivated fetal calf serum was identified as surrogate matrix to substitute for human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dilutional linearity and parallelism could be successfully confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analyte was measured in the study matrix with intra- and inter-run precision and accuracy â‰¤20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stability was proven over a period of at least 15 months as well as upon three freeze-thaw cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SVEGFR-3 concentrations decreased in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> to 57% (IQR 50-88%) and 58% (IQR 47-80%) of the respective baseline concentrations in healthy volunteers and mCRC patients, respectively, with subsequent increase after stop of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ELISA for the quantification of sVEGFR-3 in human plasma was successfully validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The applicability of the assay was demonstrated in two clinical trials </plain></SENT>
