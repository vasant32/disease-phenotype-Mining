<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The Florida Initiative for Quality <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care (FIQCC) was established to evaluate the quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care at the regional level across the state of Florida </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed adherence to validated quality indicators in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and the variability in adherence by practice site, volume, and patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The FIQCC is a consortium of 11 medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practices in Florida </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical record reviews were conducted for 507 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and seen as new medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> patients in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five indicators were evaluated individually and categorized across clinical domains and components of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean adherence for 19 of 35 individual indicators was &gt; 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathology reports were compliant on reporting depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion (96%; range, 86% to 100%), grade (93%; range, 72% to 100%), and status of proximal and distal surgical resection margins (97%; range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>86% to 100%); however, documentation of lymphovascular and perineural invasion did not meet adherence standards (76%; range, 53% to 100% and 39%; range, 5% to 83%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, documentation of the status of surgical radial margins was consistently low across sites (42%; range, 0% to 100%; P = .19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Documentation of planned treatment regimens for adjuvant chemotherapy was noted in only 58% of eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this large regional initiative, we found high levels of adherence to more than half of the established quality indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the quality of care delivered within FIQCC practices seems to be high, several components of care were identified that warrant further scrutiny on both a systemic level and at individual centers </plain></SENT>
