<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To perform meta-analyses using observational studies to assess the association between the use of selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic search of relevant studies published through February 2012 was carried out using the Medline (PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane Library databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the observational studies that were associated with our subject and carried out a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 324 screened articles, six observational studies were included in the final analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to this meta-analysis, the use of SSRIs was not associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in pooled analyses (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.79-1.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding was consistently observed in subgroup analyses of study area, location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, duration of SSRI use, study quality, adjustment for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use, and the prevalence of overweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our research shows that the use of SSRIs does not increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm the association between SSRIs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
