<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was 6 months progression-free survival (PFS).ResultsA total of 255 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intent-to-treat population comprised 247 patients (CapOx-bevacizumab: n = 127; mCapIri-bevacizumab: n = 120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The six-month PFS rates were 76% (95% CI, 69%-84%) and 84% (95% CI, 77%-90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median PFS and OS were 10.4 months (95% CI, 9.0-12.0) and 24.4 months (95% CI, 19.3-30.7) with CapOx-bevacizumab, and 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.8-13.2) and 25.5 months (95% CI, 21.0-31.0) with mCapIri-bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> as predominant toxic effect occurred in 22% of patients with CapOx-bevacizumab and in 16% with mCapIri-bevacizumab.ConclusionsBoth, CapOx-bevacizumab and mCapIri-bevacizumab, show promising activity and an excellent toxic effect profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Efficacy is in the range of other bevacizumab-containing combination regimen although lower doses of irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> were selected for mCapIri </plain></SENT>
