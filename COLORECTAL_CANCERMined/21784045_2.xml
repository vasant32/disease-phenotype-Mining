<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify the most cost-effective FIT cutoff level for referral to colonoscopy based on data from these trials and allowing for differences in screening ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the validated MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis (MISCAN)-Colon microsimulation model to estimate costs and effects of different screening strategies for FIT cutoff levels of 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 ng/mL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each cutoff level, screening strategies were assessed with various age ranges and screening intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assumed sufficient colonoscopy capacity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cost levels, FIT screening was most effective with the 50 ng/mL cutoff level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of biennial screening between ages 55 and 75 years using FIT at 50 ng/mL, for example, was 3900 euro per life year gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Annual screening had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 14,900 euro per life year gained, in combination with a wider age range (between ages 45 and 80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the sensitivity analysis, 50 ng/mL remained the preferred cutoff level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FIT screening is more cost-effective at a cutoff level of 50 ng/mL than at higher cutoff levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This supports the recommendation to use FIT at a cutoff level of 50 ng/mL, which is considerably lower than the values used in current practice </plain></SENT>
