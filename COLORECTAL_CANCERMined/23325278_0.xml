<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the differences between in-situ, prefixation and postfixation colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> measurements, their clinical impact upon determining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> surveillance intervals, and to compare postfixation measurements using three different devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study of 107 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> resected from 65 consecutive patients (45 men, 20 women) undergoing colonoscopy as part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were measured in situ, prefixation (study gold standard) and using three measurement devices (ruler, callipers and magnifying lens) postfixation in formalin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prefixation ruler measurements were significantly higher than in-situ (P=0.02) and postfixation ruler measurements (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between in-situ and postfixation ruler measurements (P=0.36), although in-situ measurements were more variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In-situ measurements also generated more variation in surveillance intervals than postfixation measurements (9.3 vs. 5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen between measurements obtained by the three different devices postfixation (P=0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence supporting the use of postfixation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size measurements as advised by recent European pathology <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a clinically significant difference between measurement devices, we advise the ruler to be used as a standard for postfixation measurements because of its widespread availability </plain></SENT>
