<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), a putative cold and menthol receptor, contributes to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> cold hypersensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the TRPM8 is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> OPN, varying concentrations of menthol were topically applied to the tongues of healthy subjects (n = 40) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (n = 36) before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The minimum concentration of menthol to evoke CS at the menthol application site was determined as the CS detection threshold (CDT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In healthy subjects, the mean CDT was 0.068 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sex and age differences were not found in the CDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, the mean CDT significantly decreased from 0.067% to 0.028% (P = 0.0039) after the first course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> infusions, and this marked CS occurred in patients who had grade 1 or less neurotoxicity, and grade 2 neurotoxicity, but not in those with grade 3 neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, the mean baseline CDT in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-treated patients was significantly higher than that of chemotherapy-na√Øve patients and healthy subjects (0.151% vs. 0.066%, P = 0.0225), suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> sensory changes may be concealed by progressive abnormalities in sensory axons in severe neurotoxicity, and that TRPM8 is subject to desensitization on repeat stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates the feasibility of undertaking CDT test in a clinical setting to facilitate the identification of early neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results indicate potential TRPM8 involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> OPN </plain></SENT>
