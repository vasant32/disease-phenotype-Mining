<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: We prospectively analyzed the long-term overall survival (OS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> control outcomes of 121 patients with five or fewer clinically detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, from any primary site, metastatic to one to three organ sites, and treated with SBRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Freedom from widespread distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (FFDM) was defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> not amenable to local therapy (i.e., resection or SBRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognostic variables were assessed using log-rank and Cox regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, the median follow-up was 4.5 years (7.1 years for 16 of 39 patients alive at the last follow-up visit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-year OS, FFDM, and local control (LC) rate was 74%, 52%, and 87%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 6-year OS, FFDM, and LC rate was 47%, 36%, and 87%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the multivariate analyses, the variables of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastases</z:e> (p = .057) and one vs. more than one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p = .055) were associated with a fourfold and threefold reduced hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the 17 bone lesions from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> recurred after SBRT vs. 10 of 68 lesions from other organs that recurred (p = .095) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients with nonbreast <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, the median follow-up was 1.7 years (7.3 years for 7 of 82 patients alive at the last follow-up visit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 2-year OS, FFDM, and LC rate was 39%, 28%, and 74%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 6-year OS, FFDM, and LC rate was 9%, 13%, and 65%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For nonbreast <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, a greater SBRT target volume was significantly adverse for OS (p = .012) and lesion LC (p &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients whose metastatic lesions, before SBRT, demonstrated radiographic progression after systemic therapy experienced significantly worse OS compared with patients with stable or regressing disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Select patients with limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> treated with SBRT are long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future research should address the therapeutic benefit of SBRT for these patients </plain></SENT>
