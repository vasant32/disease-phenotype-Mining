<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: AKT (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3) was a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and played crucial roles in protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, survival, and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PI3K/AKT pathway was commonly activated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and was recognized as a potential target for anticancer therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, clinical, molecular, or prognostic features of AKT-activated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> remained uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a database of 717 colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Ser473 phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) expression was detected in 448 (62%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute mortality hazards ratio (HR), adjusting for clinical and tumoral features, including PIK3CA, KRAS, BRAF, microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), LINE-1 methylation, TP53 (p53), and FASN (fatty acid synthase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> p-AKT expression was associated with PIK3CA mutation (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.80; P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p-AKT expression was significantly associated with longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank P = .0005), univariate Cox regression (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47-0.82; P = .0006) and multivariate analysis (adjusted HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56-0.99; P = .048) adjusting for clinical and molecular variables including PIK3CA, MSI, CIMP and LINE-1 hypomethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p-AKT expression was inversely associated with high stage (III-IV) (adjusted OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.88, P = .0071) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p-AKT expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is associated with low stage and good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>p-AKT may serve as a tissue biomarker to identify patients with superior prognosis and a possible therapeutic target (analogous to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor ESR1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
