<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinical and molecular factors related to different treatments for MCRAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with MCRAs were consecutively enrolled from January 2003 to June 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of their APC and MutYH genes was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical, molecular, and family histories of the patients were collected using the Progeny database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient treatments were divided into three groups of increasing clinical weight: endoscopic polypectomy, segmental resection, and total colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis of clinicomolecular factors related to different treatment options was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study comprised 80 patients (32 women, 40%) with a median age of 53 years (range 13-74 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was 33 (range 10-90).The cases included 62 diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e>, 18 segmental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis coli</z:e> and synchronous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; 34 cases, 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic mutations were biallelic MutYH (n = 19, 24%) and APC (n = 4, 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 74 months (median 43 months, range 1-468 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic polypectomy was performed in 25 cases (31%), segmental resection in 16 cases (20%), and total colectomy in 39 cases (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The logistics regression analysis, considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, showed that the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and mutation were correlated with more intensive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For the patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, only the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was correlated with the severity of the treatment (p &gt; 0.0166). "On the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve, 25 was the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> that best discriminated between surgical and endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with MCRAs undergo surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, only the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and not the presence of a disease-causing mutation, is correlated with increased heaviness of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with more than 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> are more likely to undergo a surgical resection </plain></SENT>
