<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to quantify the relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) as a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and to estimate whether this risk may be modified by long-term use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Personal histories of IBD and medication use were measured by structured, in-person interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of IBD and effect modification by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> were quantified by conditional and unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1921 matched pairs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and controls, a self-reported history of IBD was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use was associated with a reduced risk of both IBD-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (odds ratio [OR] = 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.78) and non-IBD <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may be more protective among those with IBD (ratio of OR = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01-1.31; P = .51), although not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use in patients with a history of IBD was suggestive of reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> but did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.12-1.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was elevated 1.9-fold in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
