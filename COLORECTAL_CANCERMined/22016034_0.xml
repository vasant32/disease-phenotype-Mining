<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Treatment of large colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (&gt;20 mm in diameter) by conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) often results in piecemeal resection that requires further intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of EMR with circumferential incision (CEMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2008-July 2009, we resected 24 large colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> measuring 20-40 mm in diameter by using the CEMR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CEMR was performed by using a ball-tip bipolar needle knife with a snaring technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the injection of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> into the submucosal layer, a circumferential incision was made, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was resected by snaring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions that showed a noninvasive pattern were diagnosed by magnifying chromoendoscopy as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or intramucosal or submucosal superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of en bloc resections and complications and the overall procedure time were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportions of en bloc and 2-piece resections by CEMR were 67% (16/24) and 17% (4/24), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median (interquartile range) time for CEMR completion was 40 minutes (30-63 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No postsurgery complications occurred in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CEMR might provide acceptable clinical outcomes for patients with large colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It results in a low incidence of incomplete treatments and low risk of complications </plain></SENT>
