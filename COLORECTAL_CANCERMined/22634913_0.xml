<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 383 patients were enrolled in this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathohistological analyses were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, the patients underwent surgery and obtained material was also pathohistologically analyzed in order to perform the Astler-Coller classification and the classification of the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the period 2000-2004 in the Tuzla Canton there were 383 newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 62 Â± 12 years, and the incidence was equally distributed per genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal tumour</z:e> was noted in 145 (37.9%) patients, and in 238 (62.1%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was found elsewhere in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average incidence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 15.73/100,000, with a dramatic increase in incidence in 2003 of 27.40/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average mortality incidence during the study was 6.89/100,000, and the largest number of the patients (339, 88.6%) was in an advanced stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There has been a significant increase in the number of newly detected cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Tuzla Canton during 2000- 2004, which implies the need for initiating a National Early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Detection Programme </plain></SENT>
