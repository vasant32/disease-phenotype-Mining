<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>20-25% of Stage II patients also develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, high-risk patients may benefit from chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As patient response to standard chemotherapy varies, the study of molecular differences in the expression of pharmacologically relevant genes may help clinicians to understand variability and tailor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) pathway genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from 53 Stages II-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who underwent 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy was investigated by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were dichotomized into high- and low-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level groups using median values of gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, a threshold analysis to identify a cut-off distinguishing recurrent- or nonrecurrent-disease was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high degree of interpatient variation in relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> expression of study genes was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple gene correlations were found, which suggest possible coregulation mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant relationship between experimental data and baseline clinical/pathological characteristics or clinical outcome was observed using gene expression median values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Threshold analysis indicated significant inverse relationships between deoxyuridine triphosphatase (DUT), ferrodoxin reductase (FDXR) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> protein p53 (TP53) and disease-free survival (DFS) in the entire case series and between DUT or NM23-H1 and DFS in Stage III patients: higher gene expression was associated with shorter DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study provides data on relationships between expression of 5-FU pathway genes and clinical outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients undergoing 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy and underscores the predictive role of specific genes </plain></SENT>
