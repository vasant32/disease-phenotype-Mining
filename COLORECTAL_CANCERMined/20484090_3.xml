<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of a novel decision aid on SDM in the primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An interactive, computer-based decision aid for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was developed and evaluated within the context of a randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 665 average-risk patients (mean age, 57 years; 60% female; 63% black, 6% Hispanic) were allocated to 1 of 2 intervention arms (decision aid alone, decision aid plus personalized risk assessment) or a control arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interventions were delivered just prior to a scheduled primary care visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures (patient preferences, knowledge, satisfaction with the decision-making process [SDMP], concordance between patient preference and test ordered, and intentions) were evaluated using prestudy/poststudy visit questionnaires and electronic scheduling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 95% of patients in the intervention arms identified a preferred screening option based on values placed on individual test features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean cumulative knowledge, SDMP, and intention scores were significantly higher for both intervention groups compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concordance between patient preference and test ordered was 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who preferred colonoscopy were more likely to have a test ordered than those who preferred an alternative option (83% v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>70%; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intention scores were significantly higher when the test ordered reflected patient preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our interactive computer-based decision aid facilitates SDM, but overall effectiveness is determined by the extent to which providers comply with patient preferences </plain></SENT>
