<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether a hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diet enriched with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> influences the formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) in colonic mucosa of Wistar rats treated with azoxymethane (AOM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At eight weeks of life, the rats were assigned to four groups: Group I-standard diet (STD) not treated with AOM; Group II-hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diet (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FED</z:e>), not treated with AOM; Group III-STD, treated with AOM; Group IV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FED</z:e>, treated with AOM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 16 weeks, the animals were injected intraperitoneal with 0.9% saline solution (Group I and II) or AOM at 15 mg/Kg (Groups III and IV) once a week for two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen weeks later, the animals were euthanized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FED</z:e> promoted <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in Groups II and IV compared to Groups I and III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The groups did not differ with regard to the total number of ACF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Chi-square test revealed no predominance of the presence of foci with &lt;4 crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, foci with â‰¥5 crypts were proportionally more prevalent in Group III than in Group IV (p=0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The administration of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> did not interfere with the formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath>, but reduced ACF multiplicity, exercising an attenuating effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
