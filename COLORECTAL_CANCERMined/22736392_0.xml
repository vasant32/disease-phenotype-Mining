<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, CD133 expression was evaluated in pre-RCT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsies and the corresponding post-RCT surgical specimens from patients with locally advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and expression levels were correlated with histopathologic features and clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients with International Union Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (UICC) stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who received preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU)-based RCT within the German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal Cancer</z:e> Trials were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-RCT and post-RCT CD133 expression levels were determined using immunohistochemistry and were correlated with histopathologic parameters, <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grade, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e>, and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with pre-RCT biopsies, significantly higher CD133 expression was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no correlations were observed for either biopsies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens between CD133 expression levels, histopathologic characteristics, or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In matched analyses of corresponding biopsy/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pairs, patients who had an increased fraction of CD133-expressing (CD133+) cells after preoperative RCT had significantly higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> stages (P = .02) and lower histopathologic <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these patients had significantly reduced disease-free survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific overall survival in univariate analysis (P &lt; .001 and P = .004, respectively) and multivariate analysis (P = .003 and P = .024, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The enrichment of CD133+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells during preoperative RCT was correlated with minor local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response, increased distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e>, and decreased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current results indicate that the up-regulation of intratumoral CD133 expression, in contrast to absolute pre-RCT and post-RCT CD133 levels, plays an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who are receiving neoadjuvant RCT </plain></SENT>
