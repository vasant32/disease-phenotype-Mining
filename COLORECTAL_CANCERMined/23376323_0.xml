<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data on clinical and demographic characteristics of 50 patients who fulfilled the criteria for SPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis were used to identify BRAF and KRAS mutations in 432 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> collected from 37 patients; we analyzed CpG island methylator phenotypes in 272 of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (30%) had type 1 SPS and 35 had type 2 SPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in age at diagnosis, sex, smoking frequency, body mass index, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> predisposition between groups of patients, or in the pathologic or molecular characteristics of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> was reported more frequently by patients with type 2 SPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutations were found in 63% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and KRAS mutations were found in 9.9%; 43.4% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> had the CpG island methylator phenotype-high phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A per-patient analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a BRAF or KRAS mutation in more than 25% of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>; 84.8% of patients had a mutation in BRAF or KRAS in more than 50% of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Except for a greater likelihood of familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> in patients with type 2 SPS, we found no significant demographic, pathologic, or molecular differences between types 1 and 2 SPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a BRAF or KRAS mutation in at least 25% of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
