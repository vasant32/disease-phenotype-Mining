<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the influence that rare variants and low-frequency polymorphisms in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> candidate gene CCND1 have on the development of multiple intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with &lt;100 multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed before 50 years of age were recruited in UK, and screened for sequence changes in the coding and regulatory regions of CCND1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A set of about 800 UK control individuals was genotyped for the variants discovered in the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variants in the promoter, intron-exon boundaries and untranslated regions of the CCND1 gene had higher frequencies in cases than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of these variants were typed in a set of French multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> patients, who also showed higher allele frequencies than UK controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When pooled together, variants with frequencies lower than 1% conferred an increased risk of disease that was significant in the multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> group (odds ratio (OR) 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.4; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most variants had a putative functional effect when assessed in silico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that rare variants of CCND1 are risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with considerably larger effects than common polymorphisms, and as such should be systematically evaluated in susceptibility studies </plain></SENT>
