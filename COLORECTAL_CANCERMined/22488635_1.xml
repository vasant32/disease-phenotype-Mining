<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study of the behavior of these components might help to predict the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the expression and clinical relevance of MMPs and TIMPs for patients with resectable colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An immunohistochemical study was performed using tissue arrays and specific antibodies against MMPs-1, 2, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14, and TIMPs-1, 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Determinations were performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens from 104 patients with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The minimum period of follow-up was 12.5 years for patients without recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To identify specific groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with distinct expression profiles, the data were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of MMP-11 by fibroblasts and MMP-13 by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dendrogram revealed first-order division of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> into two distinct MMP/TIMP molecular profiles, designated group 1 (n = 50) and group 2 (n = 54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group 2 was characterized by significantly higher expression of MMP-1, 11, and 13, and TIMP-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results emphasize the prognostic value of MMP-11 and 13 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
