<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to analyze factors affecting mortality after colorectal resection at a single tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective database for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing a colorectal resection at our institution over a 12-y period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data points included patient demographics, comorbidities, operative details, clinical presentation, postoperative complications, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1245 patients were evaluated with 41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our population was 51% male with an average age of 60.1 ± 15.2 y, mean BMI of 27.5 ± 6.4 kg/m(2), average <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score of 2.6 ± 0.9, and average of 2.2 ± 1.9 comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative factors associated with increased mortality included age, high <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score, emergent surgery, and the presence of bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or obstruction (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intra- and postoperative factors including the transfusion of blood products, length of resection, subtotal colectomy, open versus laparoscopic procedures, the need for reoperation, diagnosis and postoperative complications negatively impact survival (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that high <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score, emergent procedure, subtotal colectomy, age, obstruction, and open resection as the independent predictors of mortality in a stepwise logistic regression model (P &lt; 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preoperative <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, emergent procedure, age, open procedure, subtotal colectomy, and obstruction were the independent predictors of mortality in our review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperative optimization and counseling of elderly patients with a high <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score and/or those requiring an emergency operation should be utilized by surgeons in an effort to improve surgical mortality and patient education </plain></SENT>
