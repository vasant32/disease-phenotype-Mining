<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a substudy of the randomized phase II FNCLCC ACCORD 13/0503 trial, CECs (CD45- CD31+ CD146+ 7-amino-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15369">actinomycin</z:chebi>- cells) were enumerated in 99 patients by four-color flow cytometry at baseline and after one cycle of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We correlated CEC levels with objective response rate (ORR), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate (primary end point of the trial), PFS, and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses of potential prognostic factors, including CEC counts and Köhne score, were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By multivariate analysis, high baseline CEC levels were the only independent prognostic factor for 6-month PFS rate (P &lt; 0.01) and were independently associated with worse PFS (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High CEC levels after one cycle were the only independent prognostic factor for ORR (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High CEC levels at both time points independently predicted worse ORR (P = 0.025), 6-month PFS rate (P = 0.007), and PFS (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Köhne score was the only variable associated with OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEC levels at baseline and after one treatment cycle may independently predict ORR and PFS in mCRC patients starting first-line bevacizumab and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
