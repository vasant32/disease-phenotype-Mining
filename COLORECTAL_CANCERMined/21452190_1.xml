<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine the association between short- and long-term outcomes and deprivation for patients undergoing operative treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the Northern Region of England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective analytical study based on the Northern Region <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Audit Group database for the period 1998-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, an area-based measure, was recalibrated and used to quantify deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were ranked based on their postcode of residence and grouped into five categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 8159 patients in total, 7352 (90·1 per cent) had surgery; 6953 (94·6 per cent) of the 7352 patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> resection and 4935 (67·7 per cent) of 7294 had a margin-negative (R0) resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deprivation was not associated with age, sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> site, stage or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-related factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the most affluent group, the most deprived patients had fewer elective operations (72·9 versus 76·4 per cent; P = 0·014), more adverse co-morbidity (P &lt; 0·001) and fewer curative resections (65·5 versus 71·2 per cent; P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, deprivation was not an independent predictor of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (odds ratio (OR) 0·72, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·48 to 1·06; P = 0·101) but it was a predictor of curative resection (OR 1·24, 1·01 to 1·52; P = 0·042), overall survival (HR 0·83, 0·73 to 0·95; P = 0·006) and relative survival (HR 0·74, 0·58 to 0·95; P = 0·023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deprivation, both independently and by influencing other surgical predictors, impacts on short- and long-term outcomes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
