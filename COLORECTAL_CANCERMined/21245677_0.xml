<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The general practitioner (GP) is most commonly the initiator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EDIFICE 2 survey, carried out in 2008 among 600 GPs, showed that 83% of GPs were convinced of the importance of screening, but that only 30% of GPs systematically recommended the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main underlying reasons were that only 50% of GPs declared themselves sufficiently trained, GPs needed clear guidelines and information supports for patients and a better implication in the programme's overall organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This important role was confirmed by patients as the second most important reason for not undergoing screening: the absence of recommendation from their treating physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optimization of the screening procedure thus requires a stronger implication of GPs, by confirming their pivotal role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and by relying on clear reference documentation guaranteeing quality assurance of a national organized screening programme </plain></SENT>
