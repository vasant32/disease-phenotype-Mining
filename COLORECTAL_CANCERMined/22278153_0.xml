<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The principal aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate the incidence of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> in a region of northern Italy using a standardized method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were prospectively enrolled from October 2002 to December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a structured family history, the microsatellite instability (MSI) test and a screen for MUTYH mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following family history patients were classified as belonging to high, moderate and mild risk families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 proteins and investigation for MLH1/MSH2 mutations, for MLH1 promoter methylation and for the V600E hotspot BRAF mutation were performed in high MSI (MSI-H) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 430 patients enrolled, 17 (4%) were high risk [4 hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC), 12 suspected HNPCC and 1 MUTYH-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (MAP)], 53 moderate risk and 360 mild risk cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MSI test was performed on 393 tumours, and 46 (12%) of them showed MSI-H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these patients, one MLH1 pathogenetic mutations and two MSH2 pathogenetic mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two (70%) MSI-H cases demonstrated MLH1 methylation and/or BRAF mutation: None of them showed MLH1/MSH2 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two biallelic germline MUTYH mutations were found, one with clinical features of MAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A strong family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was present in 4% of the enrolled cases; incidence of MLH1/MSH2 or MUTHY mutations was 1.3% and of MSI-H phenotype was 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MLH1 methylation and BRAF mutation can exclude 70% of MSI-H cases from gene sequencing </plain></SENT>
