<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three (27.5%) of the 120 patients showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> TCF12 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression and had a higher rate of metastatic occurrence (p = 0.020) and a poorer survival outcome (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abundant TCF12 levels were also observed in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines such as SW620 and LoVo, but a relatively low level was detected in SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of TCF12 expression in SW620 and LoVo cells drastically reduced their activities of migration, invasion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tight cell-cell contact and an increase in E-cadherin but a concomitant decrease in fibronectin were observed in TCF12-knockdown cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Connexin 26, connexin 43, and gap-junction activity were also increased upon TCF12-knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ectopic TCF12 overexpression in SW480 cells facilitated fibronectin expression and cell migration and invasion activities but diminished cellular levels of E-cadherin, connexin 26, connexin 43, and gap junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A physical association of TCF12 with the E-cadherin promoter was evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCF12 was tightly correlated with cellular expression of Bmi1 and EZH2 and was co-immunoprecipitable with Bmi1 and EZH2, suggesting that TCF12 transcriptionally suppressed E-cadherin expression via polycomb group-repressive complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically, TCF12 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression was also correlated with E-cadherin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> down-regulation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues of our 120 patients (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies suggested that TCF12 functioned as a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin and its overexpression was significantly correlated with the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
