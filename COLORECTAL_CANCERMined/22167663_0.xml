<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anti-angiogenic agents are now being clinically evaluated for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> and a detailed investigation of the angiogenic profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the plasma concentrations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related molecules in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, compared with those with other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma samples obtained from 45 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> were analyzed and compared with those from 9 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, 16 patients with benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary diseases</z:e> and 58 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related molecules including angiopoietin-2, follistatin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-8, leptin, platelet-derived growth factor beta <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, platelet endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor were determined using an antibody suspension bead arrays system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related molecules were not increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, compared with those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> and benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary diseases</z:e>, whereas the levels of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma interleukin-8 concentration was significantly elevated in patients with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and was associated with a poor treatment outcome of chemotherapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The plasma levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related molecules were not elevated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, compared with those with benign diseases or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma interleukin-8 level may be a novel biomarker for the response to chemotherapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> and warrants further prospective study </plain></SENT>
