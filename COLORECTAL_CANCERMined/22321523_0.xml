<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) routinely include bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified a correlation between bevacizumab and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> formation after resection of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Patients undergoing treatment with bevacizumab for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> after 2005 were identified and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 222 consecutive patients, 9 patients treated with bevacizumab subsequently developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients' charts were reviewed with attention to diagnosis, timing of operation relative to bevacizumab therapy, location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 9 identified patients (9 of 222, 4.1%), 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and 1 had synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>Fistulas</z:mpath> were most commonly anal or perineal (6 of 9, 66.7%) and colovesicular (3 of 9, 33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On average, bevacizumab was initiated 23.6 months after the initial operation; complications occurred 3.9 months after starting bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nearly uniformly, cessation of bevacizumab led to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> healing; however, 3 patients (33%) required fecal diversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab is the most common antiangiogenesis agent used for treatment of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previous adverse events associated with bevacizumab treatment include venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001058'>poor wound healing</z:hpo>, and spontaneous bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this report, late postoperative development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> occurred relatively soon after initiation of bevacizumab and usually spontaneously resolved with cessation of bevacizumab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on the timing of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> development relative to operation and initiation of bevacizumab, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> are likely secondary to bevacizumab therapy rather than postsurgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> occur in a small, but significant proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and must be recognized early </plain></SENT>
