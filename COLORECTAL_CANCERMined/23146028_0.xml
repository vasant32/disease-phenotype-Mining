<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VEGFR and PDGFR are key players involved in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of genetic variants in these receptors and its potential clinical implications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: VEGFR2, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ mutations were evaluated by sequencing their tyrosine kinase domains in 8 CRC cell lines and in 92 samples of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations with clinicopathological features and survival were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four SNPs were identified, three in PDGFRα [exon 12 (A12): c.1701A&gt;G; exon 13 (A13): c.1809G&gt;A; and exon 17 (A17): c.2439+58C&gt;A] and one in PDGFRβ [exon 19 (B19): c.2601A&gt;G] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SNP B19, identified in 58% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples and in 4 cell lines (LS174T, LS180, SW48, COLO205), was associated with higher PDGFR and pPDGFR protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this observation, 5-year survival was greater for patients with PDGFR B19 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (AA) than for those harboring the G-allele genotype (GA or GG) (51% vs 17%; p=0.073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed SNP B19 (p=0.029) was a significant prognostic factor for survival, independent of age (p=0.060) or TNM stage (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PDGFRβ exon 19 c.2601A&gt;G SNP is commonly encountered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and is associated with increased pathway activation and poorer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Implications regarding its potential influence in response to PDGFR-targeted agents remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
