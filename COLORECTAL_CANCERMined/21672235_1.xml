<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear if loss of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> is the specific underlying cause of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Drosophila imaginal discs are excellent systems in which to study <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> function, as it is possible to model human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> through the generation of somatic clones of cells bearing multiple genetic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, these attributes of the fly system were utilized to investigate the potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressing functions of the Drosophila <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> homologue frazzled (fra) during eye-antennal disc development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most fra loss of function clones are eliminated during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when mutant clone cells generated in the developing eye were rescued from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, partially differentiated eye cells were found outside of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eye field, and in extreme cases distant sites of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characterization of these cells during development indicates that fra mutant cells display characteristics of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, including increased levels of phospho-ERK, phospho-JNK, and Mmp-1, changes in cadherin expression, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, and loss of polarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation of fra promotes basement membrane degradation and invasion which are repressed by inhibition of Rho1 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although inhibition of JNK signaling blocks invasive phenotypes in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> models in flies, blocking JNK signaling inhibits fra mutant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, thereby enhancing the fra mutant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation provide the first direct link between point mutations in fra/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and metastatic phenotypes in an animal model and suggest that Fra functions as an invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor during Drosophila development </plain></SENT>
