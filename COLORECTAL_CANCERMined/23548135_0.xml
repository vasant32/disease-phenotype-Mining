<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the responsiveness of generic and condition-specific instruments based on the anchor of self-reported level of global change in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Three hundred thirty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were surveyed at two assessments at baseline and follow-up at 6 months from September 2009 to July 2010 using the Short Form-12 Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2) and Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The responsiveness of the two measures was evaluated using standardized effect size, standardized response mean, responsiveness statistic, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In worsened group, internal responsiveness of detecting negative changes was satisfactory for most subscales of FACT-C and SF-12v2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FACT-C subscales were significantly more responsive to positive changes detection than the SF-12v2 subscales in improved group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physical well-being subscale, Trial Outcome Index (TOI), and total score of FACT-C were more externally responsive to ROC curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FACT-C measure was generally more responsive to changes in health status compared with SF-12v2 measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TOI and total score of FACT-C were the most responsive among subscales of condition-specific measure, which were more responsive than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> generic subscales with the exception of social domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complementary use of condition-specific and generic instruments to evaluate the health-related quality of life of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients is encouraged </plain></SENT>
