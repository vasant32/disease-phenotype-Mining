<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> infiltrating B cells (TiBc) have not yet been investigated in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may at least in part be due to technical difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a straightforward and reproducible method to isolate and culture TiBc from primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS/RESULTS: TiBc cultures were generated by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immortalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this method, monoclonal TiBc cultures were obtained for 14/19 CRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As assessed by flow cytometry and ELISA, TiBc showed an activated immunophenotype (CD23(+), CD80(+)) and produced immunoglobulin (Ig; IgG secretion in 55% of the cultures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In functional in vitro analysis, most of the IgGs specifically bound to allogeneic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that TiBc are antigen-experienced and thus may exhibit functionality in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, mini-cultures generated from 12 further <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> revealed TiBc outgrowth exclusively in the presence of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In summary, this simple method provides a cellular tool and our data set the stage for analysing the bivalent role of TiBc; being antigen-presenting cells on the one hand and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antibody producers on the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the generation of long-term TiBc cultures and their monoclonal Ig may serve to identify novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antigens </plain></SENT>
