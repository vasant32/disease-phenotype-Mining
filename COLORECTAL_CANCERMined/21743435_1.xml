<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single-punch (n=1280; cohort 1) and multiple-punch (n=195; cohort 2) tissue microarrays were used for dual-labelling fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amplification was defined as a ratio &gt;2 times for 6p12/centromere 6 signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of KRAS (codons 12 and 13) and BRAF (codon V600E) and immunohistochemistry for p-MAPK3/MAPK1, PEBP1, HMMR, p-AKT, PLAU, PLAUR, TP53 and VEGFA were performed on cohort 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cohort 1, VEGFA amplification was found in 39/1280 (3%) cases and linked to higher pT stage (P=0.022), higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (P=0.024) and vascular invasion (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 31% (95% CI 17-46) and 57% (95% CI 54-60) for amplified and nonamplified cases, respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were confirmed in cohort 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, the relative risk for amplification was 2.09 (95% CI 1.4-3.1; P&lt;0.001) and linked to more frequent BRAF mutation (P=0.015), overexpression of p-MAPK3/MAPK1 (P=0.012) and PLAU (P=0.048) and loss of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> suppressor protein PEBP1 (P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VEGFA gene locus amplification highlights a small but remarkably aggressive subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential role of amplification as a prognostic or predictive biomarker in both metastatic and nonmetastatic patients </plain></SENT>
