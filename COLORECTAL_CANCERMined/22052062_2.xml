<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Three large randomised trials have shown that screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) using the faecal occult blood test (FOBt) can reduce the mortality from this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The largest of these trials, conducted in Nottingham since 1981, randomised 152,850 individuals between the ages of 45 and 74 years to an intervention arm receiving biennial Haemoccult (FOB) test kit or to a control arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2006, the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme was launched in England using the FOBt, with the expectation that it will reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality and incidence in the intervention arm with the control arm after long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 152,850 randomised individuals were followed up through local health records and central flagging (Office for National Statistics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 19.5 years there was a 13% reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality (95% CI 3% to 22%) in the intervention arm despite an uptake at first invitation of approximately 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality reduction in those accepting the first screening test, adjusted for the rate of non-compliers, was 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in mortality from causes other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between the intervention and control arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite removing 615 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> &gt;10 mm in size from the intervention arm, there was no significant difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality was sustained, further follow-up of the screened population has not shown a significant reduction in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, despite the removal of many large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> there was no reduction in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> which was independent of sex and site of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
