<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the positivity and detection rates of the FIT and to compare the detection rates of the qualitative and quantitative FITs in participants in the 2009 NCSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed positivity and detection rates according to FIT type (qualitative and quantitative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a multinomial logistic regression to analyze the odds ratio of "benign" or "suspicious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>" compared to "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>," adjusted for gender, age, health insurance type, region of residence, hospital type, and FIT type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1,181,904 participants, 72.8% received a qualitative and 27.2% a quantitative FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positivity rates were 8.1% for the qualitative and 2.5% for the quantitative FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The detection rate was 5.2% for the qualitative and 14.4% for the quantitative FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of a "suspicious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>" versus a "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" result was 2.73 (95% CI = 2.22-3.35) for the quantitative compared to qualitative FIT, after adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The positivity rate of the qualitative FIT was around three times higher than that of the quantitative FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the odds ratio for detection of "suspicious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>" versus "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" of the quantitative FIT was about three times higher than that of the qualitative FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that quality control may be important, particularly for the qualitative FIT </plain></SENT>
