<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to make a comprehensive assessment of the potential association between two genetic variants in the IL-10 gene promoter, -1082 A&gt;G (rs1800896) and -592 C&gt;A (rs1800872), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk, we conduced a meta-analysis of seven epidemiological studies, which included 1469 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 2566 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neither of the two polymorphisms had any association with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in overall population [for rs1800896: odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.76-1.06 in the dominant model and for rs1800872: OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 0.91-1.23 in the dominant model] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analysis of the rs1800896 polymorphism, the results did not change when the analyses were restricted to individual studies, or those fulfilling Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, or according to the source of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For rs1800872, however, when stratifying by the source of controls, the A allele had a significant increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among studies with population-based controls in the codominant model (AC vs CC: OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.04-1.63) and dominant model (AA/AC vs CC: OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.01-1.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on this meta-analysis, we conclude that the IL-10 rs1800872 polymorphism could be a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development among European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we found no association between the IL-10 rs1800896 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies, either with larger sample size or involving other SNPs and haplotypes of the IL-10 gene, are necessary to clarify the contribution of IL-10 genetic variations in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
