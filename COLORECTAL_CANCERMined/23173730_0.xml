<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> is an extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of diseases traditionally categorized according to tissue of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, even among patients with the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> subtype the cellular alterations at the molecular level are often very different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several new therapies targeting specific molecular changes found in individual patients have initiated the era of personalized therapy and significantly improved patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) a selected group of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS respond to antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Testing for KRAS mutations is now required prior to anti-EGFR treatment, however, less sensitive methods based on conventional PCR regularly fail to detect KRAS mutations in clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have developed sensitive and specific assays for detection of the seven most common KRAS mutations based on a novel methodology named Competitive Amplification of Differentially Melting Amplicons (CADMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical applicability of these assays was assessed by analyzing 100 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples, for which KRAS mutation status has been evaluated by the commercially available TheraScreenÂ® KRAS mutation kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CADMA assays were sensitive to at least 0.5% mutant alleles in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> background when using 50 nanograms of DNA in the reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consensus between CADMA and the TheraScreen kit was observed in 96% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cases where disagreement was observed the CADMA result could be confirmed by a previously published assay based on TaqMan probes and by fast COLD-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high analytical sensitivity and specificity of CADMA may increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of KRAS mutation testing in mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
