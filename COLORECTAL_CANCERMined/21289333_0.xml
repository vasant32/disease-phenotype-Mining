<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of mutations of the KRAS codons 12 and 13 as a selection biomarker for anti-endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody treatment is at present the first major step towards individualised treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of BRAF V600E mutation is not well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 803 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were explored for KRAS exon 2 and BRAF exon 15 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutated samples were characterized for mismatch repair function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 344 tumours were mutated, with 34 of them involving BRAF mutations (8 of microsatellite instability type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No specificity was found according to gender, age at diagnosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> localisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A complete analysis of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA status may identify approximately 10-15% additional patients who are unlikely to respond an EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody and who may benefit from prospective and specific new biomarker-driven studies </plain></SENT>
