<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Individuals with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may be more susceptible to adverse effects of alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether the association between alcohol consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk differed by family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We conducted prospective studies in women and men in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alcohol consumption was first assessed in 1980 in women and in 1986 in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a follow-up of 26 y among 87,861 women and 20 y among 47,290 men, we documented 1801 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (1094 women and 707 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher alcohol consumption was associated with an elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, although the association was significant only for the highest intake category of ≥30 g/d, with no significant linear trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between alcohol consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk differed by family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; in comparison with nondrinkers, the pooled multivariate RRs for alcohol consumption of ≥30 g/d were 1.23 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.57; NS) among those with no family history and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.30, 3.13) among those with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (P value test for difference = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with nondrinkers with no family history, the RR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was 2.80 (95% CI: 2.00, 3.91) for individuals who consumed ≥30 g/d and who had a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reducing alcohol consumption may decrease the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, especially among those with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
