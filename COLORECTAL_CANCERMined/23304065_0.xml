<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although magnifying chromoendoscopy had been a reliable diagnostic tool, narrow-band imaging (NBI) has been developed in Japan since 1999 and has now replaced the major role of chromoendoscopy because of its convenience and simplicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we principally describe the efficacy of magnifying chromoendoscopy and magnifying colonoscopy with NBI for detection, histological prediction, estimation of the depth of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and future prospects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although some meta-analyses have concluded that NBI is not superior to white light imaging for detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in screening colonoscopy, NBI with magnification colonoscopy is useful for histological prediction, or for estimating the depth of invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To standardize these diagnostic strategies, we will focus on the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification proposed for use by endoscopists with or without a magnifying endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, more prospective research is needed to prove that this classification can be applied with satisfactory availability, feasibility, and reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the future, NBI might contribute to the evaluation of real-time histological prediction during colonoscopy, which has substantial benefits for both reducing the risk of polypectomy and saving the cost of histological evaluation by resecting and discarding diminutive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> (resect and discard strategy) </plain></SENT>
