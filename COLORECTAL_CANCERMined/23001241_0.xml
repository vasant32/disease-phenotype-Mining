<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced 5-mC levels in peripheral blood leukocytes have been associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in cross-sectional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To minimize disease- and/or treatment-related effects, we studied leukocyte 5-mC levels in prospectively collected blood specimens of 370 cases and 493 controls who were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free at blood collection from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte 5-mC level was determined by a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)/tandem mass spectrometry method and expressed as the relative amount of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> to total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> residues, or %5-mC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We estimated the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk and %5-mC categories by computing ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) through logistic regression modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed no dose-dependent association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and%5-mC categories (lowest vs. highest tertile: OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.80-1.63; P(trend) = 0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, among subjects whose 5-mC levels were at the highest tertile, we observed an inverse association between natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (highest tertile of natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> vs. lowest: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.71; P(trend) = 0.003; P(interaction) = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This prospective investigation show no clear association between leukocyte 5-mC level and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk but a suggestive risk modification between 5-mC level and natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Adequate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> status may protect against colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> through mechanisms involving adequate DNA methylation in the genome </plain></SENT>
