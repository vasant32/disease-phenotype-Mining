<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine test characteristics important to patients and to examine trade-offs in attributes that patients are willing to accept in the context of the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A discrete choice study was used to assess preferences of patients with clinical indications suspicious of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who experienced both CTC and colonoscopy as part of a diagnostic accuracy study in South Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed by using a mixed logit model and presented as odds ratios (ORs) for preferring CTC over colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Colonoscopy was preferred over CTC as the need for a second procedure after CTC increased (OR of preferring CTC to colonoscopy = 0.013), as the likelihood of missing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> increased (OR of preferring CTC to colonoscopy = 0.62), and as CTC test cost increased (OR of preferring CTC to colonoscopy = 0.65-0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CTC would be preferred to colonoscopy if a minimal bowel preparation was available (OR = 1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some patients were prepared to trade off the diagnostic and therapeutic advantage of colonoscopy for a CTC study with a less intensive bowel preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preferences also varied significantly with sociodemographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite CTC's often being perceived as a preferred test, this may not always be the case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Informed decision making for diagnostic tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> should include discussion of the benefits, downsides, and uncertainties associated with alternative tests, as patients are willing and able to make trade-offs between what they perceive as the advantages and disadvantages of these diagnostic tests </plain></SENT>
