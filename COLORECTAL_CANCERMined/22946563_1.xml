<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The guidance of developing axons and migrating neurons is likely to depend on the precise control of plasmalemma turnover in selected regions of leading edges and growth cones, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous results provided evidence of a signaling mechanism that couples chemotropic deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>)/Netrin-1 axonal guidance and exocytosis through Syntaxin1(Sytx1)/TI-VAMP SNARE proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we studied whether Netrin-1-dependent neuronal migration relies on a similar SNARE mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that migrating neurons in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) express several SNARE proteins, and that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> co-associates with Sytx1 and TI-VAMP in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that cleavage of Sytx1 by botulinum toxin C1 (BoNT/C1) abolishes Netrin-1-dependent chemoattraction of migrating neurons, and that interference of Sytx1 functions with shRNAs or Sytx1-dominant negatives disrupts Netrin-1-dependent chemoattraction of LRL neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that a Sytx1/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> interaction is required for Netrin-1 guidance of migrating neurons, thereby highlighting a relationship between guidance signaling and SNARE proteins that regulate membrane turnover </plain></SENT>
