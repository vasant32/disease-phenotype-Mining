<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Despite the recent introduction of targeted bio-drugs, the scarcity of successful therapeutic options for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains a limiting factor in patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of curative surgical interventions can only be extended through earlier detection of metastatic foci, which is dependent on both the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We propose a high-performance imaging platform based on <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46793">poly(ethylene glycol)</z:chebi> nanoparticles doped with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52334">rhodamine B</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52295">cyanine</z:chebi> 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous detection of these dyes is the basis for background subtraction and signal amplification, thus providing high-sensitivity imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functionalization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46793">poly(ethylene glycol)</z:chebi> tails on the external face of the nanoparticles with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> guarantees their homing to and accumulation at target tissues, resulting in specific visualization, even of submillimetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results reported here demonstrate that our rationally designed modular nanosystems have the ability to produce a breakthrough in the detection of micrometastases for subsequent translation to clinics in the immediate future </plain></SENT>
