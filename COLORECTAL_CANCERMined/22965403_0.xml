<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of delayed repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapy after cytoreduction of colorectal and appendiceal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinomatosis</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_303'>pseudomyxoma peritonei</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study constitutes a retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was conducted at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (23) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_303'>pseudomyxoma peritonei</z:mpath> (8) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Cytoreduction was followed by placement of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> barrier and intraperitoneal catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peritoneal scintigraphy preceded biweekly intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and systemic combination chemotherapy with leucovorin, fluorouracil, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured are safety, feasibility, and short-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cytoreduction to a score of 0 to 1 was possible in 25 patients (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 16 patients (51.6%) and were confined to grades I to III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and no digestive fistulae occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Port malfunction or complication resulted in removal in 5 patients (16.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal chemotherapy was possible in 83.8% of patients; 55% completed the full course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Peritoneal scintigraphy demonstrated free diffusion of tracer in 18 patients (58%), 4 (12.9%) had diffusion in each gutter with limited communication, 5 (16.1%) had limited diffusion around each catheter without communication, and 2 (6.5%) had no diffusion on scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall survival for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> was 44.5% at 3 years (95% CI = 23%-65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The nonrandomized nature of this study and the early experience are limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Delayed repeated intraperitoneal and systemic chemotherapy after cytoreduction is feasible and has acceptable morbidity rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Delayed intraperitoneal chemotherapy is possible in 83% of patients </plain></SENT>
