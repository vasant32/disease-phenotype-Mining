<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: We looked for JCV DNA in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, Group A) and with positive family history and Bethesda criteria (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the role of JCV may be different between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-six patients were randomly selected from our database, 30 in Group A and 26 in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was isolated from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, and plasma, and JCV DNA sequences were looked for with specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for T Ag primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, and PMS2 was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Group A, T Ag was demonstrated in 6 (20.00%) and 3 (10.00%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, respectively (P = 0.094) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group B, the corresponding observations were 10 (38.46%) and 6 (23.07%), respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, and PMS2 was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the Group A and B patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients of Group A (100%) showed expression of these proteins, while only 19 patients of Group B did so (73.1%), P = 0.009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>JCV T Ag DNA was found in 20, 28.5, and 42.1% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in Group A, Group B with negative staining for DNA repair genes, and Group B with a positive staining, respectively (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with positive family history have a higher incidence of JCV T Ag, but this did not correlate with specific DNA repair gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We could not conclude that, on the background of genetic mutation in one of the DNA repair genes, JCV acts as the missing link in the chain of events leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
