<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: On the basis of the results of our preliminary trial suggesting that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) could be eradicated by short-term administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi>, in the present study, we explored the feasibility of using ACF as surrogate markers for chemoprevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental design: Randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> (300 mg daily), etodolac (400 mg daily), and placebo groups were 189 subjects without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> or who had undergone polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drugs were administered for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ACF in the rectal region were counted by magnifying endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was evaluated at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A planned interim analysis was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ACF number at 2 months was significantly suppressed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> group (P = 0.0075), but not in the etodolac group (P = 0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> group, the numbers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> plus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> (total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at 12 months were significantly (P = 0.02) and marginally (P = 0.064) lower, respectively, in comparison with the placebo group; no such difference was observed in the etodolac group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In analysis of only polypectomized subjects, the numbers of total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> group were even more markedly lower, with P values of 0.014 and 0.034, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar tendency was confirmed by analyses of the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Suppression rates of total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in ACF responders to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> were significantly greater than in nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, compliance was more than 90% and no intolerable adverse effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ACF may be useful as surrogate lesions for chemoprevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
