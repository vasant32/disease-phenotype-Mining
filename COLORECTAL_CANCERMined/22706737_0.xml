<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether serum placenta growth factor could provide carcinoembryonic antigen-independent prognostic information on patients undergoing curative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum and tissue samples were collected from 158 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and from 50 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum and tissue levels of placenta growth factor were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum placenta growth factor levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were compared with those in healthy controls, and we retrospectively assessed the association between serum placenta growth factor levels and clinicopathological findings and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of placenta growth factor was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues compared with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean serum placenta growth factor level in patients was significantly higher than that in controls and significantly higher in patients with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, lymph-node involvement and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum placenta growth factor levels are significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development, lymph or distant invasive phenotypes and survival, especially in stage II or III patients </plain></SENT>
