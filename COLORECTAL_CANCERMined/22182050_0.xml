<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Evidence suggests that follow-up after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> improves survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is so common that patient follow-up can overwhelm a service, affecting the ability to see new referrals and reassess patients seen previously who have new symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to cope with this demand a nurse-led follow-up service was started in 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to review the results of a nurse-led <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> follow-up clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between 1 December 2004 and 31 January 2011, patients who underwent resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were followed up by a nurse specialist according to a protocol determined by the colorectal surgeons in the unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patient details were recorded prospectively in a purpose designed database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine hundred and fifty patients were followed up over 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some 368 patients were discharged from the follow-up programme, 474 patients remain actively involved in the programme and 108 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients discharged from the follow-up scheme 269 (73%) were discharged to their general practitioner free of disease after 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 108 who patients died, 98 were as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (2.1%) were identified with local (peri-anastomotic) disease recurrence and 93 patients (9.8%) were found to have developed distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of these, 65 patients (6.8%) were referred for palliative care and 28 (2.9%) had surgery for focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> of whom 18 were still alive at the time of this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This paper shows that a nurse-led clinic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> follow-up can achieve satisfactory results with detection rates of recurrent or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> comparable to consultant follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A nurse-led clinic provides the benefits of follow-up without overwhelming the consultant colorectal surgical clinic practice </plain></SENT>
