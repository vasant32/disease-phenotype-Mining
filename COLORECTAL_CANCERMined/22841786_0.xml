<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy has become the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test in the United States, but the degree to which it protects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of the proximal colon is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined US trends in rates of resection for proximal vs distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which reflect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence, in the context of national <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening data, before and since Medicare's 2001 decision to pay for screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest US <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-payer inpatient database, to estimate age-adjusted rates of resection for distal and proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, from 1993 to 2009, in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Temporal trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of resection for distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> decreased from 38.7 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.4-42.0) to 23.2 per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 20.9-25.5) from 1993 to 2009, with annual decreases of 1.2% (95% CI, 0.1%-2.3%) from 1993 to 1999, followed by larger annual decreases of 3.8% (95% CI, 3.3%-4.3%) from 1999 to 2009 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the rate of resection for proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> decreased from 30.0 per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 27.4-32.5) to 22.7 per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 20.6-24.7) from 1993 to 2009, but significant annual decreases of 3.1% (95% CI, 2.3%-4.0%) occurred only after 2002 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rates of resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> decreased for adults ages 50 years and older, but increased for younger adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that population-level decreases in rates of resection for distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are associated with screening, in general, and that implementation of screening colonoscopy, specifically, might be an important factor that contributes to population-level decreases in rates of resection for proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
