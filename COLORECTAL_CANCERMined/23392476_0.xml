<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The liver is the most frequent site of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; however, the impact of HS on the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is not clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, the correlation with the presence or absence of HS was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 604 CRC patients receiving curative surgical resection who had a preoperative non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean attenuation values (in Hounsfield units) of the liver and spleen were obtained on a plain CT slice, and the patients with liver-spleen attenuation ratio lower than 1.1 were objectively defined as HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathological features of these patients were analyzed, and the association between HS and the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-three (10.4 %) among the 604 patients were diagnosed as HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>, but not extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>, were significantly higher in the group with HS (p = 0.04 and p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this effect was not evident in the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, defined as body mass index &gt; 25.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the stage I~III cases, HS was significantly associated with lower hepatic, but not extrahepatic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, absence of HS was an independent risk factor for hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">Metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are less frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
