<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The TDs had been debated for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The seventh edition of TNM staging system proposed a "pN1c" concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the value of the modification is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1541 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rates were compared between patients without LNM but TD (+), and those who were TD (-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TDs were stratified into the "any T + any N" category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-step multivariate analysis was performed to identify significant prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis was used to determine whether a correlation existed between the number of TDs and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant prognostic difference between patients without LNM or TDs compared with those with positive TDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only in T3N2bM0 there was a significant prognostic difference between LNM (+), TD (+) patients and TD (-) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The seventh edition of TNM staging system was substituted by the novel TNM staging system in 2-step multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only in T3N1cM0 there was a significant prognostic difference between patients with only 1 TD and those with more than 1 TD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The seventh edition of TNM staging system on TDs satisfactorily predicts patients' outcome for those without LNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients who categorized as T3N2bM0TD (+) and T4N2bM0TD (-/+) should be reclassified as stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Number of TDs was not an independent prognostic parameter in the TNM staging system </plain></SENT>
