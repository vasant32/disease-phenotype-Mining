<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The link between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2D) has been extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is commonly accepted that T2D is a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Given that the genetic background contributes to both traits, it is conceivable that genetic variants associated with T2D may also influence the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected 26 T2D-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) previously identified by genome-wide association studies and assessed their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and their interaction with known risk factors (gender, T2D, and body mass index) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selected SNP were genotyped in 1798 CRC cases and 1810 controls from the population-based Darmkrebs: Chancen der Verhütung durch Screening (DACHS) study (Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients carrying the TCF7L2_rs7903146_T allele had an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P(trend) = 0.02), whereas patients harboring the IL13_rs20541_T allele had a reduced risk (P(trend) = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A further analysis revealed gender-specific effects: the TCF7L2_rs7903146_T allele was associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in women (P(trend) = 0.003) but not in men (P(interaction) = 0.06); the LTA_rs1041981_A allele was associated with a decreased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in women (P(trend) = 0.02), with an opposite effect in men (P(trend) = 0.05; P(interaction) = 0.002); the CDKAL1_rs7754840_C allele was associated with a decreased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in men (P(trend) = 0.03), with no effect in women (P(interaction) = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk associated with the presence of T2D was modified both by IGF2BP2_rs4402960 and PPARγ_rs1801282 SNP (P(interaction) = 0.04 and 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the findings were significant after correction for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that T2D-related variants modify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk independently and/or in an interactive manner according to the gender and the presence or absence of T2D </plain></SENT>
