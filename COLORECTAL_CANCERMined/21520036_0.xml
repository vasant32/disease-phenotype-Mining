<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The optimal strategy for identifying patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> among patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several predictive models (e.g., MMRpredict, PREMM1,2 and MMRpro) combining personal and familial data have recently been developed to quantify the risk that a given patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> carries a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>-causing mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their clinical applicability to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from the general population requires evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied a consecutive series of 214 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> characterized for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microsatellite instability (MSI), somatic BRAF mutation, MLH1 promoter methylation and mismatch repair (MMR) gene germline mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The performances of the models for identifying MMR mutation carriers (8/214, 3.7%) were evaluated and compared to the revised Bethesda guidelines and a molecular strategy based on MSI testing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients followed by the exclusion of MSI-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases from mutational testing by screening for BRAF mutation and MLH1 promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivities of the three models, at the lowest thresholds proposed, were identical (75%), with similar numbers of probands eligible for further MSI testing (almost half the patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our dataset, the prediction models gave no better discrimination than the revised Bethesda guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both approaches failed to identify two of the eight mutation carriers (the same two patients, aged 67 and 81 years, both with no family history) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, like the revised Bethesda guidelines, predictive models did not identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> in our series of consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results support systematic screening for MMR deficiency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
