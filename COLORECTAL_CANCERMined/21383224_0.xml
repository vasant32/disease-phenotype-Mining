<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a prospective case study of colonoscopies from 1998 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate age, sex, colonoscopy indications, and findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) based on age, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We reviewed 6425 colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients was 57.4 years (SD, Â±13.5 years), and 55% of patients were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-six (2.1%) of these had unintentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>; for 32 patients (0.4%), unintentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was the only indication for the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was diagnosed in 116 patients (1.8%), but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was not detected in any patients for whom unintentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> as the only indication for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on our prospective case study, unintentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> alone was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
