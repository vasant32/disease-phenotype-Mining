<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an automated telephone intervention for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening from a managed care perspective, using data from a pragmatic randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intervention patients received calls for fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched patients' electronic medical records for any screening (defined as FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema, or colonoscopy) during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervention costs included project implementation and management, telephone calls, patient identification, and tracking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening costs included FOBT (kits, mailing, and processing) and any completed screening tests during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the cost per additional screen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 months, average costs for intervention and control patients were $37 (25% screened) and $34 (19% screened), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ICER at 6 months was $42 per additional screen, less than half what other studies have reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cost-effectiveness probability was 0.49, 0.84, and 0.99 for willingness-to-pay thresholds of $40, $100, and $200, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar results were seen at 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A greater increase in FOBT testing was seen for patients aged &gt;70 years (45/100 intervention, 33/100 control) compared with younger patients (25/100 intervention, 21/100 control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intervention was dominant for patients aged &gt;70 years and was $73 per additional screen for younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It increased screening rates by about 6% and costs by $3 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At willingness to pay of $100 or more per additional screening test, an automated telephone reminder intervention can be an optimal use of resources </plain></SENT>
