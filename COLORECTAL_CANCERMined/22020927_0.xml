<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to create a nomogram to predict the disease-free survival of patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> treated with hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Perioperative factors were assessed in 727 hepatectomized patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> between 2000 and 2004 at the 11 institutions of the "Project Committee of the Liver" in the Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A nomogram was developed as a graphical representation of a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perioperative mortality was 0.55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease-free and overall survival rates were 31.2 and 63.8% at 3 years, 27.2 and 47.7% at 5 years, and 24.7 and 38.5% at 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six preoperative factors were selected to create the nomogram for disease-free survival: synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, 3 points; primary lymph node positive, 3 points; number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> 2-4, 4 points and ≥5, 9 points; largest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter &gt;5 cm, 2 points; extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> at hepatectomy, 4 points, and preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level &gt;100, 4 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated median disease-free survival time was easily calculated by the nomogram: &gt;8.4 years for patients with 0 points, 1.9 years for 5 points, 1.0 years for 10 points, and the rates were lower than 0.6 years for patients with more than 10 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This nomogram can easily calculate the median and yearly disease-free survival rates from only 6 preoperative variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is a very useful tool to determine the likelihood of early recurrence and the necessity for perioperative chemotherapy in patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> after hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
