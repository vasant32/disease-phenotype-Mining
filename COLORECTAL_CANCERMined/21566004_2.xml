<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> self-report measures across three racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 2004 and 2005, 271 white, African-American and Hispanic participants were recruited from a primary care clinic in Southeast Texas, and their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing history based on self-report and medical record (the 'gold standard') were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over-reporting was prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, up-to-date <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test use was 57.6% by self-report and 43.9% by medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Racial/ethnic group differences were most pronounced for Hispanics in whom sensitivity was significantly lower for any up-to-date testing, fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy and double contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences across groups for over-reporting, specificity or concordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-report prevalence data are overestimating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups; current measures are less sensitive in Hispanics </plain></SENT>
