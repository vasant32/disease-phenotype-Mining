<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genes that are highly overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells can be required for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell survival and have the potential to be selective therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to identify such targets, we combined a functional genomics and a systems biology approach to assess the consequences of RNAi-mediated silencing of overexpressed genes that were selected from 140 gene expression profiles from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) and matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to identify credible models for in-depth functional analysis, we first confirmed the overexpression of these genes in 25 different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then identified five candidate genes that profoundly reduced the viability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines when silenced with either siRNAs or short-hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (shRNAs), i.e., HMGA1, TACSTD2, RRM2, RPS2 and NOL5A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These genes were further studied by systematic analysis of comprehensive gene expression profiles generated following siRNA-mediated silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exploration of these RNAi-specific gene expression signatures allowed the identification of the functional space in which the five genes operate and showed enrichment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific signaling pathways, some known to be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By comparing the expression of the RNAi signature genes with their respective expression levels in an independent set of primary rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, we could recapitulate these defined RNAi signatures, therefore, establishing the biological relevance of our observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This strategy identified the signaling pathways that are affected by the prominent oncogenes HMGA1 and TACSTD2, established a yet unknown link between RRM2 and PLK1 and identified RPS2 and NOL5A as promising potential therapeutic targets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
