<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pattern-recognition molecules <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL) and the three ficolins circulate in blood in complexes with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When MBL or ficolin recognizes a microorganism, activation of the MASPs occurs leading to activation of the complement system, an important component of the innate immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three proteins are produced from the MASP1 gene: MASP-1 and MASP-3 and MAp44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present an assay specific for MASP-1, which is based on inhibition of the binding of anti-MASP-1-specific antibody to MASP-1 domains coated onto microtitre wells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MASP-1 was found in serum in large complexes eluting in a position corresponding to ∼600 kDa after gel permeation chromatography in calcium-containing buffer and as monomers of ∼75 kDa in dissociating buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of MASP-1 in donor sera (n = 105) was distributed log-normally with a median value of 11 µg/ml (range 4-30 µg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> plasma levels were similar, while the values in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30347">ethylenediamine</z:chebi> tetraacetic acid plasma were slightly lower and in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plasma were 1·5 times higher than in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MASP-1 was present at adult level at 1 year of age, while it was 60% at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy individuals the level of MASP-1 was stable throughout a 2-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After induction of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reaction by operation we found an initial short decrease, concomitant with an increase in C-reactive protein levels, followed by an increase, doubling the MASP-1 concentration after 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present data prepare the ground for studies on the associations of MASP-1 levels with disease </plain></SENT>
