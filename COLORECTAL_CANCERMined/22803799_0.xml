<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases with MSI-H or high-level CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP-H) have similar histomorphological features, yet seemingly opposite prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> budding is related to CIMP, thus partially explaining this prognostic difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: MSI, KRAS, BRAF, CIMP and 0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) were investigated in tissues from 127 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> budding was scored using pan-cytokeratin-stained whole tissue sections within the densest area of buds (Ã—40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> budding was not associated with KRAS, BRAF, MGMT or CIMP, but was correlated inversely with MSI-H (P = 0.0049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate survival time analysis revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> budding was independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five molecular features and was predicted by MSI status [odds ratio (OR): 4.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-12.1; P = 0.006)], but not CIMP (OR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.3-2.5; P = 0.714) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings underline that MSI, rather than CIMP, plays a role in conferring a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> budding phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Budding retains its unfavourable prognostic effect independently of these five molecular features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Continued efforts to standardize the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> budding are necessary to integrate this feature into daily diagnostic routine </plain></SENT>
