<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous analysis of a randomized community-based trial of a multi-component intervention to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening among Filipino Americans (n = 548) found significantly higher screening rates in the two intervention groups compared to the control group, when using intent-to-treat analysis and self-reported screening as the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes more nuanced findings obtained from alternative approaches to assessing intervention effectiveness to inform future intervention implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of the intervention on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening receipt during follow-up was estimated using methods that adjusted for biases due to missing data and self-report and for different combinations of intervention components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for self-report used data from a validation substudy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness within demographic subgroups was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyses accounting for self-report bias and missing data supported the effectiveness of the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intervention was also broadly effective across the demographic characteristics of the sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Estimates of the intervention effect were highest among participants whose providers received a letter as part of the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings increase confidence that the intervention could be broadly effective at increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses and attempts to deconstruct multi-component interventions can provide important information for future intervention development, implementation, and dissemination </plain></SENT>
