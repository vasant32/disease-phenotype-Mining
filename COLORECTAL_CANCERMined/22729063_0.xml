<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To estimate the colonoscopy burden of introducing population screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using biennial immunochemical faecal occult blood tests offered to people aged 50-74 years of age was modelled using population estimates from Statistics New Zealand for 2011-2031 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Modelling to determine colonoscopy requirements was based on participation and test positivity rates from published results of screening programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Estimates of the number of procedures required for ongoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> surveillance were calculated using screening literature results of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> yield, and New Zealand Guidelines for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> Surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis was undertaken on key parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For a test positivity of 6.4%, biennial screening using immunochemical faecal occult blood testing with a 60% participation rate, would require 18,000 colonoscopies nationally, increasing to 28,000 by 2031 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of procedures are direct referrals from a positive FOBT, with surveillance colonoscopy numbers building over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy requirements for immunochemical faecal occult blood based population screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant expansion of services is required and careful management of surveillance procedures to ensure timely delivery of initial colonoscopies whilst maintaining symptomatic services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A model re-run informed by data from the screening pilot will allow improved estimates for the New Zealand setting </plain></SENT>
