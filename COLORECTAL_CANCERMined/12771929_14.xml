<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of COX-2 induction is not fully understood, but requires de novo <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein synthesis, indicating regulation at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the COX-2 gene shows two nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of this protein in model cell culture systems attenuates COX-2 expression and implies that NF-kappa B plays an important role in COX-2 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured COX-2, NF-kappa B and I kappa B kinase alpha (IKK alpha) protein expression in matched colonic biopsy samples comprising both nontumour and adjacent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue from 32 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was none or very little expression of COX-2, NF-kappa B and IKK alpha in non-neoplastic colon epithelial cells, while the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of these proteins was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon's signed rank test) in adjacent cancerous cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three proteins were found to be coexpressed in the neoplastic epithelium, with the expression of COX-2 and NF-kappa B highly correlated (Pearson's correlation, P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent correlation between enhanced COX-2, NF-kappa B or IKK alpha expression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> Dukes' stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that IKK alpha and NF-kappa B are involved in COX-2 induction in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and the lack of association between COX-2 expression and severity of disease as measured by Dukes' stage is consistent with the proposal that COX-2 expression is an early postinitiation event </plain></SENT>
