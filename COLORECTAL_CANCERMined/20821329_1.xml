<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="36940">19F</z:chebi> magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used in vivo to measure 5FU's half-life and metabolism to cytotoxic fluoronucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown better survival associated with longer 5FU <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This work investigated 5FU pharmacokinetics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 32 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergoing 5FU treatment, 15 of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, were examined in a 1.5T MRI scanner, using a large coil positioned over the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-localised spectra were acquired in 1-min blocks for 32 min after injection of a 5FU bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5FU half-life was measured in each subject, and averaged spectra were examined for the presence of fluoronucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Associations with progression-free survival were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No association was observed between 5FU half-life, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> burden and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Half-lives were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> shorter than those associated with improved survival in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, in the group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, high levels of fluoronucleotides were associated with poorer survival; this counterintuitive result may be due to the higher levels of fluoronucleotides (whose level is higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver) in patients with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> burdens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that future studies use chemical shift imaging at higher field strengths to better resolve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-localised spectroscopy retains prognostic potential by enabling straightforward detection of fluoronucleotides, which are present at very low concentrations distributed throughout the tissue </plain></SENT>
