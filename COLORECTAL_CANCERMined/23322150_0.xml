<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Estimates were based on national alcohol consumption and overweight prevalence data in the German population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparative analyses were used to evaluate the variation of PAF estimates according to changes in the calculation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PAFs quantify the preventive potential that could result from removing or reducing the risk factor exposure, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postmenopausal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was estimated to be preventable by 13-23% if the population were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among German men, 10-25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> were attributable to alcohol consumption and 7-13% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> to overweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparative analyses demonstrated that preventability estimates vary considerably with the chosen data (risk estimates, reference categories) for PAF calculation and can differ by up to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, data selection should be evidence based, for example, based on meta-analyses, in order to increase the validity of preventability estimates </plain></SENT>
