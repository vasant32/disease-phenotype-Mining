<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve healthy control patients were positioned supine with knee flexion at 90° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplex ultrasound examined common femoral vein (CFV) and proximal femoral vein diameter, peak systolic velocity, and volume flow with hip flexion at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using the paired t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the CFV, hip flexion to 90° was associated with a significant increase in mean volume flow when compared with hip flexion at 0° (.59 vs .36 L/min; P = .05) and 30° (.59 vs .35 L/min; P = .038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both the CFV and proximal femoral vein, increased hip flexion was associated with significantly reduced vessel diameter and increased peak systolic velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative positioning of the lower extremities represents a modifiable risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When stirrups are used, hip flexion of 90° maximizes venous drainage from the legs </plain></SENT>
