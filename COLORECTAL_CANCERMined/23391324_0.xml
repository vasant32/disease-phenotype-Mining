<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circulating miRNAs are emerging biomarkers in many diseases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> among others; however, defining a plasma miRNA signature in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) that could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis or in the follow-up has not been done yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TaqMan miRNA microarray was performed to identify deregulated miRNAs in the plasma of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to validate the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the highly and significantly identified deregulated miRNA(s) as potential candidate biomarker(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma expression level of let-7d, miR-150, miR-339, and miR-342 was down-regulated whilst that of let-7b, and miR-523 was up-regulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> group at diagnosis compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ROC curve analyses revealed an AUC (the areas under the ROC curve) of 0.835 (95% CI: 0.7119- 0.9581; P&lt;0.0001) and 0.8125 (95% CI: 0.6796-0.9454; P=0.0005) for miR-150, and miR-342 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined ROC analyses using these 2 miRNAs revealed an elevated AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.7819-0.94; P&lt;0.0001) indicating the additive effect in the diagnostic value of these 2 miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>QRT-PCR results showed that the expression level of these two miRs in complete remission <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients resembled that of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that plasma miR-150 and miR-342 are novel important promising biomarkers in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
