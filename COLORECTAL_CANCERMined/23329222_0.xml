<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: CHEK2 encodes a cell cycle checkpoint kinase that plays an important role in the DNA damage repair pathway, activated mainly by ATM (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>Telangiectasia</z:hpo> Mutated) in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A germline mutation in CHEK2, 1100delC, has been described as a low penetrance allele in a significant number of families with breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in certain countries and is also associated with increased risk of contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in women previously affected by the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About 5%-10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are associated with hereditary predisposition and its recognition is of great importance for genetic counseling and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Here, we have assessed the frequency of the CHEK2 1100delC mutation in the germline of 59 unrelated Brazilian individuals with clinical criteria for the hereditary breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A long-range PCR strategy followed by gene sequencing was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 1100delC mutation was encountered in the germline of one (1.7%) individual in this high risk cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the CHEK2 1100delC is not commonly encountered in Brazilian families with multiple diagnoses of breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results should be confirmed in a larger series of families and further testing should be undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the hereditary breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
