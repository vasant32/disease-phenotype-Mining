<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies indicate that screening in combination with lifestyle modification may produce a greater reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> rates than screening alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify national opportunities for the primary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we assessed the prevalence of modifiable lifestyle risk factors in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used nationally representative, cross-sectional data from 5 NHANES cycles (1999-2000, n = 2,753; 2001-2002, n = 3,169; 2003-2004, n = 2,872; 2005-2006, n = 2,993; 2007-2008, n = 3,438) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the 5 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk factors deemed "convincing" by the World <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research Fund (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, physical inactivity, intake of red meat, processed meat, alcohol), and cigarette smoking, a "suggestive" risk factor in the Surgeon General's report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We estimated the prevalence of each risk factor separately and jointly, and report it overall, and by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2007 to 2008, 81% percent of U.S. adults, aged 20 to 69 years, had at least one modifiable risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 15% of those younger than 50 years had 3 or more risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no change in the prevalence of risk factors between 1999 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common risk factors were risk factors for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide additional support for the prioritization of preventive services in health care reform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing awareness, especially among young adults, that lifestyle factors influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases, may encourage lifestyle changes and adherence to screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complementary approaches of screening and lifestyle modification will likely provide the greatest reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
