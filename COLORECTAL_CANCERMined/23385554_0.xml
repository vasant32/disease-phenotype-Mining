<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 42 patients with 54 hepatic lesions, who had been treated from 2007 to 2011 at two institutions, were retrospectively reviewed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients received radical resections of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, and had been presented with one to two hepatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The radiation dose of 40-75 Gy in 10-20 fractions (median, 50 Gy in 10 fractions) was delivered for the planning target volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up time of 15 months, 1- and 2-year local control (LC) rates were 59.9 and 49.0 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 60.0 and 44.0 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter of &lt;3 cm and biologically effective dose (BED) of ≥100 Gy(α/β=10) were significantly associated with higher LC and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tended to be associated with higher LC (P = 0.075), and was significantly associated with higher OS (P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>12 (28.6 %) of the 42 patients had grade 1-2 toxicities, and grade 3 or higher toxicity did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hypofractionated radiotherapy with Tomotherapy was safe for patients with hepatic oligometastases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The maximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter of &lt;3 cm and BED of ≥100 Gy(α/β=10) were significant prognostic factors for higher local control and survival, and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients had statistically higher overall survival than the others </plain></SENT>
