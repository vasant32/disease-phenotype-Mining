<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 332 patients from six centers were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had received biweekly FOLFIRI in combination with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks schedule for various reasons in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 70 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had 2-week treatment schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first-line therapy (n = 240), the overall response rate (ORR) was 34.1 % in 2-week and 36.3 % in 4-week groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8 months (95 %CI, 6.8-9.2) and 9 months (95 %CI, 6.6-11.4) (p = 0.074), and median overall survival (OS) was 22 months (95 %CI, 15.8-28.2) and 20 months (95 %CI, 8.1-31.9) (p = 0.612) in 2- and 4-week groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-year survival rate was 76.2 % for 2-week group and 73.2 % for 4-week group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second-line therapy (n = 92), the ORR was similar between the groups (24.5 vs 25.9 % in 2- and 4-week groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 6 months (95 %CI, 4.7-7.3) and 11 months (95 %CI, 6.3-15.7) (p = 0.074), and median OS was 15 months (95 %CI, 9.6-20.4) and 17 months (95 %CI, 13.7-20.3) (p = 0.456) for 2-week and for 4-week groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-year survival rate was 61.3 % for 2-week and 71.3 % for 4-week groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxicity profile was similar in 2- and 4-week groups and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, mucositis, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and fistulization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks in combination with biweekly FOLFIRI had similar efficacy and tolerability in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of the retrospective nature of our study, the data should be examined cautiously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, our study clearly points out the need for determination of optimum biological dosing interval of bevacizumab in well-designed, prospective, randomized trials </plain></SENT>
