<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the unusual case of a previously healthy 45-year-old man with PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was admitted for work-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo> and was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative evaluation was unremarkable, and he subsequently underwent an uneventful laparoscopic total colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The next day, he complained of chest tightness, and a computed tomography enterography revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> throughout the entire superior mesenteric vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further laboratory evaluation revealed decreased free protein S levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the PROS1 gene revealed a heterozygous transition (NM_000313.3 c.1907A &gt; G), resulting in an amino acid change (p.Tyr636Cys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although several case reports have described mesenteric <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (MVT) in individuals with PSD, most have just reported decreases in the activity or concentration of protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirmed a nucleotide alteration of PROS1 associated with PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This patient, who had hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, may have developed MVT after transient exposure to abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We may need to implement more comprehensive coagulation testing prior to surgery considering the prevalence and possible risk of thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
