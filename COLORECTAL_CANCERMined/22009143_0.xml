<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence supports <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) as the underpinning of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> link </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) is a widely accepted index of evolving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and early IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of the relation between HOMA-IR and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors sought to determine the associations of HOMA-IR and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (waist to hip ratio [WHR]) with risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in a screening colonoscopy-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors collected lifestyle information and fasting blood samples from 1222 participants (320 incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cases and 902 without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>) before their screening colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unconditional logistic regression models were used to assess risk associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate analysis of participants (n = 1093) reporting no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication use, those in the top quartile of WHR were twice as likely (odds ratio [OR], 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-3.57; P-trend = .003) and those in the top quartile of HOMA-IR were 63% more likely (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09-2.44; P-trend = .01) to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> compared with those in the bottom quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis revealed a statistically significant interaction between HOMA-IR and sex (P-interaction = .04), with the association largely limited to men; compared with those in the bottom tertile, men in the top tertile of HOMA-IR were twice more likely to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.18-3.78; P-trend = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results support central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, particularly in men, as important risk factors for the development of early colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
