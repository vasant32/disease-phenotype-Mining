<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that participate in the spatiotemporal regulation of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant miRNA expression leads to developmental abnormalities and diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The miR-135a is considered to be oncogenic; however, the functions and mechanisms of miR-135a in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated the functions and mechanisms of miR-135a, especially its relationship with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> suppressor 1 (MTSS1) gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of miR-135a was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, while its effect on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, without and with matrigel, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of MTSS1 was detected by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that miR-135a expression was higher in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples than in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using SW480 and SW620 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, increased proliferation was observed in response to miR-135a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that miR-135a promoted mobility and invasion via transwell assay with and without Matrigel, respectively, of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, inhibition of miR-135a reduced their proliferative and invasive capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MTSS1 was identified as a candidate target gene of miR-135a by luciferase report assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that the expression of MTSS1 was regulated by miR-135a overexpression and knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly, miR-135a-mediated cell mobility and invasion were reduced after MTSS1 was knocked down by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data indicated that miR-135a promotes the growth and invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, at least partially, through targeting MTSS1 </plain></SENT>
