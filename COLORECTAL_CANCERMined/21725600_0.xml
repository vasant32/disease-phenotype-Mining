<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 61 samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue and corresponding blood samples were obtained from the surgical department of our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tissue samples were examined by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against Sonic Hh (SHH), Pathed (PTCH) and Gli1, and evaluated independently for protein expression by two pathologists blinded to clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the immunohistochemistry results, SHH and PTCH expression varied in terms of histological type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (MA) Hedgehog signaling was not highly expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were more significant differences in the expression of SHH and PTCH (P&lt;0.05), compared with Gli1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significant differences were found in the expression of SHH, Gli1 and PTCH between the MSI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hedgehog signals were more frequently expressed in the MSI group compared with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study indicates that the expression of the Hh signaling pathway may play a significant role in MSI in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
