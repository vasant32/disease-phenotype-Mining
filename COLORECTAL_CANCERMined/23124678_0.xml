<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The role of resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic resection has become an accepted therapeutic option for treating early stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; however, it has not been evaluated for use in patients with advanced stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study to evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> exclusively in patients with stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> compared to open resection in patients with stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and laparoscopic resection in patients with stage I-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in terms of operative results and short- and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laparoscopic resection was performed in 35 stage IV patients and open resection was performed in 40 stage IV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighteen stage I-III patients who underwent laparoscopic resection were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the comparison between the laparoscopic group and the open group among patients with stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, postoperative recovery appeared to be better in the laparoscopic group than in the open group, as reflected by shorter times to resumption of a regular diet (p = 0.049), shorter lengths of hospitalization (p = 0.083), increased feasibility of postoperative chemotherapy (p &lt; 0.001), shorter time intervals from surgery to chemotherapy (p = 0.031) and longer median survival (p = 0.078) at the expense of longer operative times (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the comparison between the laparoscopic resection in stage IV and stage I-III disease groups, no significant differences were observed in operative results and short- and long-term outcomes, except for the rate of ostomy creation (48.5 vs. 8.5 %, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> in patients with stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> achieves equivalent results to that performed in patients with stage I-III disease and that performed in patients with stage IV disease using open resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of a minimally invasive approach in the laparoscopic procedure is beneficial because it results in shorter times to resumption of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet, shorter lengths of hospitalization, increased feasibility of postoperative chemotherapy and shorter time intervals from surgery to chemotherapy at the expense of longer operative times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that patients undergoing laparoscopic resection can receive targeted chemotherapy earlier and more aggressively, which might provide a survival benefit </plain></SENT>
