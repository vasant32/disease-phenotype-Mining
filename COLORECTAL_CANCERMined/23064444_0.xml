<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of the significant advances in conventional therapeutic approaches to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, most patients ultimately die of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a need to develop novel preventive approaches for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out to investigate the anticancer effect of the diastereoisomeric compounds, MHY-449 and MHY-450, novel dihydrobenzofuro[4,5-b][1,8]naphthyridin-6-one derivatives, on HCT116 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MHY-449 exhibited more potent cytotoxicity than MHY-450, against HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cells with MHY-449 resulted in growth inhibition and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a concentration-dependent manner, and inhibition of proliferation in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed by decreased cell viability, DNA fragmentation, activation of protein levels involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9 and cleavage of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase and alteration in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MHY-449 induced G2/M phase arrest in the cell cycle progression which was observed by flow cytometry analysis, and a decrease in the protein expression of cyclinÂ B1 and its activating partners Cdc25c and Cdc2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MHY-449 also caused increase in the expression levels of p53, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, and p21WAF1/CIP and p27KIP, G2/M phase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MHY-449 may be a useful candidate for chemo-prevention and/or treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
