<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of our patient records showed that the addition of bevacizumab did not increase morbidity or mortality related to liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathologic complete response (CR) is associated with prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> benefit from perioperative chemotherapy and liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potential benefit of adding bevacizumab is yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impact of bevacizumab on liver resection complications has been explored in a small number of retrospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> who underwent liver resection and had received perioperative chemotherapy were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications were reported separately for 2 groups (chemotherapy alone vs chemotherapy and bevacizumab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) for responders and nonresponders were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two patients received chemotherapy alone and 42 patients received chemotherapy and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time from the end of systemic treatment to liver resection was 59 days (33-181 days) for the chemotherapy group and 62 days (44-127 days) for the chemotherapy and bevacizumab group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications developed in 54% of the chemotherapy group and in 48% of the chemotherapy and bevacizumab group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Severe complications (grade III-V) occurred in only 13% and 12%, respectively (P = .822) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pathologic complete response (CR) was seen in 11/94 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Poor performance status (PS) before starting chemotherapy was associated with higher rates of complications (P = .002), and severe complications led to prolonged hospital admission (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with pathologic CR had longer OS (P = .0275), but there was no difference in OS between responders and nonresponders (P = .778) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy does not increase liver resection complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Pathologic CR is associated with prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
