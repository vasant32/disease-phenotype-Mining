<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> and the characteristics of healthcare systems in OECD countries and to demonstrate that the increasing incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> is mainly due to overdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a random effects panel model to regress the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> on the characteristics of healthcare systems (i.e., share of public expenditure on health, mode of health financing, existence of referral system to secondary care, mode of payment to primary care physicians), controlling for macro context variables (i.e., GDP per capita, educational level) on a country level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were derived from 34 OECD countries for 2002 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The share of public expenditure on health was negatively associated with the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, it had no statistically significant effect on the mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> and on the incidence of stomach and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, it had a positive effect on the incidence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The upward trend of the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> is closely related to the healthcare system that permits overdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increases in the proportion of public financing may help reduce the overdiagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
