<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, Wnt signaling activation after the loss of APC is hypothesized to be the key event for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> initiation, whereas additional mutations such as Ras activation are required for the progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, accumulating data have led to conflicting views regarding the precise role of Ras in APC loss-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, using Drosophila midgut as a model system, we show that in the absence of Ras, APC mutant epithelial cells cannot initiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, suggesting that Ras plays an essential role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598935" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor initiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, activating Ras by expressing oncogenic Ras or Raf in APC-deficient cells led to a blockage of cell differentiation and to preinvasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> outgrowth, characteristics that are shared by advanced colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, we find that Ras is not required for Wnt signaling activation after APC loss, although Ras hyperactivation is able to potentiate Wnt signaling by increasing the cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of Armadillo/Î²-catenin via mechanisms independent of JNK/Rac1 or PI3K-Akt signaling, partly owing to the downregulation of DE-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together with the data from gene expression analyses, our results indicate that both parallel and cooperative mechanisms of Wnt and Ras signaling are responsible for the initiation and progression of intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> after APC loss </plain></SENT>
