<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We sought to assess factors related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening adherence among immigrant, Hispanic women in Harlem, New York City </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Adherence for colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test (FQBT) screening was measured among 255 women based on self-reported screening behaviors using American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Society guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate results showed that age, language of the interview (English/Spanish), years in the United States, physician recommendation for either test, marital status (living alone/living with someone), and mammography adherence were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening adherence (p's &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, having an age greater than 65 years, being interviewed in Spanish, having lived in the United States longer, having a regular doctor and a physician recommendation, and being currently adherent for mammography were associated with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among this sample, there proved to be differences between having ever been screened and adherence with a greater proportion of women having ever completed either colonoscopy and/or FOBT compared to women who were adherent (72.9% vs 58.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to determine factors associated with adherence, not just screening utilization, in order to design strategies to increase adherence among immigrant Hispanic women </plain></SENT>
