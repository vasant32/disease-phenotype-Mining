<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Determining the cytokeratin (CK) 7/CK20 pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is one of the most helpful procedures for this purpose since the CK7-/CK20+ pattern is typical of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CDX2, a critical nuclear transcription factor for intestinal development, is expressed in intestinal epithelium and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of CDX2 expression and the CK7-/CK20+ phenotype in differentiating colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> from pancreatic and <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CK7/CK20 staining pattern and CDX2 expression were evaluated in 118 cases of colorectal, 59 cases of gastric, and 32 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006725'>pancreatic adenocarcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the CK7-/CK20+ phenotype and of CDX2 expression were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CK7-/CK20+ immunophenotype was expressed by 75 of 118 (64%) colorectal and 3 of 59 (5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric tumors</z:e> and was not observed in any <z:hpo ids='HP_0006725'>pancreatic adenocarcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CK7+/CK20+ immunophenotype was expressed in 24/118 (20%) of colon, 28/59 (48%) of gastric and 7/32 (22%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006725'>pancreatic adenocarcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CK7+/CK20- expression pattern was observed in only 2% (2 of 118) of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CDX2 was expressed in 114 of 118 (97%) colorectal, 36 of 59 (61%) gastric, and 5 of 32(16%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006725'>pancreatic adenocarcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between CDX2 expression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, CDX2 expression was more common in intestinal type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than in diffuse type <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The CK7-/CK20+ phenotype showed a specificity of 96.7% in predicting colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, which was superior to that of CDX2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CDX2 expression at both cut-off levels (&gt; 5% and &gt; 50%) had a higher sensitivity (96.6% and 78%) than the CK phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both the CK7-/CK20+ phenotype and expression of the antibody CDX2 are highly specific and sensitive markers of colorectal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CDX2 expression should be a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002957'>intestinal adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, particularly when better established markers such as CK7 and CK20 yield equivocal results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The CK7-/CK20+ phenotype is superior in its specificity and positive predictive value and might be preferred </plain></SENT>
