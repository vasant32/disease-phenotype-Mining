<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), have found that use of oral bisphosphonates is associated with reduced risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, but less is known about associations with other common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in women such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A detailed health interview was conducted at baseline, and bisphosphonate use was ascertained from an inventory of regularly-used medications at baseline and over follow-up </plain></SENT>
