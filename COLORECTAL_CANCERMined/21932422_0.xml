<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum IGF1 levels have been associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk; however, studies of this association with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined serum IGF1, IGF2 and IGFBP3 levels in relation to risk of advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in a case-control study within the prostate, lung, colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> screening trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 764 advanced, left-sided colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cases and 775 controls frequency-matched on gender and ethnicity, without evidence of a left-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> on sigmoidoscopy were included in the current study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IGF1, IGF2 and IGFBP3 were measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples collected at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations adjusting for age, race, sex, year of blood draw, body mass index, smoking and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher IGF1 levels were associated with increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk: ORs = 1.58 (95% CI = 1.16-2.16), 1.42 (95% CI = 1.04-1.93), and 1.80 (95% CI = 1.30-2.47) for the second, third and fourth quartiles, respectively (p(trend) = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated IGF2 levels were also associated with increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.05-1.96 for the fourth vs. first quartile, p(trend) = 0.02), but the association was no longer significant after adjustment for IGF1 (p(trend) = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IGFBP3 levels were not associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our analysis showed a significant positive association between circulating IGF1 levels and risk of advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, suggesting that IGF1 is associated with the pivotal precursor to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
