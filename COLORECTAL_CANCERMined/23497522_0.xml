<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this extension retrospective study, we analyzed whether a panel of biomarkers, known to be associated to an adverse clinical outcome, underwent variations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> pre and post 90Y-RE.Of the 50 patients included in the study, 29 pre-90Y-RE therapy and 15 post-90Y-RE had liver biopsy specimens available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these series we investigated survivin, p53, Bcl-2 and Ki-67 expression pre- and post-90Y-RE by immuhistochemistry (IHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings evidenced a decrease of survivin (77% vs 33%), p53 (93% vs 73%), Bcl-2 (37% vs 26%) expression as well as of Ki-67 proliferation index (62.5% vs 40%) on liver biopsies collected post-90Y-RE as compared to pre-90Y-RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the subset of 13 matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> we further confirmed the reduction of survivin (92.3% vs 53.8%; p = 0.06), p53 (100% vs 69.2%; p = 0.05) and Bcl-2 (69.2% vs 53.8%; p = 0.05) expression post-90Y-RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This biomarker modulation was accompanied by morphological changes as steatohepatitis, hepatocyte <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, collagen deposition, proliferating and/or bile duct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, focal sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>.Although our analysis was conducted in a very limited number cases, these changes appear strictly related to the response to 90Y-RE therapy and may deserve further investigation on a larger series of patients </plain></SENT>
