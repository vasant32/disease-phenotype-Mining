<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>According to "fluid-mosaic model," plasma membrane is a bilayer constituted by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> which regulates the various cellular activities governed by many proteins and enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Any chemical, biochemical, or physical factor has to interact with the bilayer in order to regulate the cellular metabolism where various physicochemical properties of membrane, i.e., polarization, fluidity, electrostatic potential, and phase state may get affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have observed the in vivo effects of a pro-carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) and the two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> on various properties of the plasma membrane of colonocytes, i.e., electric potential, fluidity, anisotropy, microviscosity, lateral diffusion, and phase state in the experimentally induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of fluorescence probes were utilized like membrane fluidity and anisotropy by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51594">1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene</z:chebi>, membrane microviscosity by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39106">Pyrene</z:chebi>, membrane electric potential by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52129">merocyanine 540</z:chebi>, lateral diffusion by N-NBD-PE, and phase state by Laurdan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is observed that membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> are less densely packed and therefore, the membrane is more fluid in case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> produced by DMH than control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> are effective in reverting back the membrane toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state when co-administered with DMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The membrane becomes less fluid, composed of low electric potential <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> whose lateral diffusion is being prohibited and the membrane stays mostly in relative gel phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be stated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, the two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> may exert their anti-neoplastic role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> via modifying the physicochemical properties of the membranes </plain></SENT>
