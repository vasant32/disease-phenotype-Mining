<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2002 until February 2010, 434 patients who presented to our institution with the initial diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and were submitted to open curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections or some kind of palliative procedure either elective or emergencies were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 286 of these patients (65.8%) were below 75 years (group A) and 148 (34.2%) above 75 years (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A procedure with curative intent was undertaken in 386 patients (88.9%), while forty-eight patients (11.1%) were submitted to a palliative procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding the incidence of emergency operations, forty-five patients (15.7%) from group A and forty-four patients (29.7%) from group B were operated due to an emergency (obstructing, perforating or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score was 1.74 ± 0.84 and 2.32 ± 0.94 for groups A and B, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean TNM stage was 2.28 ± 1.00 and 2.74 ± 0.98 for groups A and B, respectively (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients exhibited increased incidence of post-operative complications and increased post-operative mortality compared with their younger counterparts (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery in the elderly is a challenging clinical scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment decision adjusted to each individual case is the ideal practice in order to maintain an acceptable balance between curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> resections and palliative procedures </plain></SENT>
