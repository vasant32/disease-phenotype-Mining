<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety, and explore efficacy and biomarkers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49960">vandetanib</z:chebi> with cetuximab and irinotecan in second-line <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49960">Vandetanib</z:chebi> (an orally bioavailable VEGFR-2 and EGFR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinases inhibitor</z:chebi>) was combined at 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg daily with standard dosed cetuximab and irinotecan (3+3 dose-escalation design) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were treated at the MTD and plasma <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> biomarkers (VEGF, PlGF, bFGF, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, SDF1α) were measured before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled at 4 dose levels and the MTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 QTc prolongation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>) were detected at 300 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49960">vandetanib</z:chebi> with cetuximab and irinotecan resulting in 200 mg being the MTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven percent of patients had a partial response, 59% stable disease and 34% progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 3.6 months (95% CI, 3.2-5.6) and median overall survival was 10.5 months (95% CI, 5.1-20.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicities were fairly manageable with grade 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> being most prominent (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49960">Vandetanib</z:chebi> and cetuximab treatment induced a sustained increase in plasma PlGF and a transient decrease in plasma sVEGFR1, but no changes in plasma VEGF and sVEGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49960">Vandetanib</z:chebi> can be safely combined with cetuximab and irinotecan for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exploratory biomarker analyses suggest differential effects on certain plasma biomarkers for VEGFR inhibition when combined with EGFR blockade and a potential correlation between baseline sVEGFR1 and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, while the primary endpoint was safety, the observed efficacy raises concern for moving forward with this combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00436072 </plain></SENT>
