<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We trained 91 Filipino Americans from 19 organizations to conduct small-group sessions with members of their organizations to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Community health advisors completed brief pre- and post-training surveys that included knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening guidelines (four items), perceived self-efficacy of performing specific tasks (15-item scale, Cronbach's alpha &gt; 0.90) and satisfaction with the training itself (five items) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Community health advisors had high levels of knowledge and self-efficacy at pre-training, but levels increased significantly immediately after the 6-h training (percent of knowledge items answered correctly: 63-94 %; self-efficacy: 8.2-8.9 on a 10 point scale, both p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlates of self-efficacy at pre- and post-test were high educational attainment, health care background, high level of participation in the organization, being perceived by others as a leader, and frequent participation in research activities in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent evaluation measuring similar constructs across studies may help to standardize the quality of the training, and may improve the implementation of community health advisor-led programs </plain></SENT>
