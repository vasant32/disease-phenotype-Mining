<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Kr√ºppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a vital role in regulating cell lineage differentiation during development and maintaining epithelial homeostasis in the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestine, KLF4 is predominantly expressed in the differentiated epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been identified as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KLF4 knockout mice demonstrated a decrease in number of goblet cells in the colon, and conditional ablation of KLF4 from the intestinal epithelium led to altered epithelial homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the role of KLF4 in differentiated intestinal cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, as well as the mechanism by which it regulates homeostasis and represses <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in the intestine is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study, KLF4 was partially depleted in the differentiated intestinal epithelial cells by a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>-inducible Cre recombinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a significant increase in the number of goblet cells in the KLF4-deleted small intestine, suggesting that KLF4 is not only required for goblet cell differentiation, but also required for maintaining goblet cell numbers through its function in inhibiting cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number and position of Paneth cells also changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the KLF4 knockout study using villin-Cre [1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Through immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and statistical analysis, we found that a stem cell and/or tuft cell marker, DCAMKL1, and a proliferation marker, Ki67, are affected by KLF4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, while an enteroendocrine cell marker, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi> (NT), was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found KLF4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> altered the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and polarity of the intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using a three-dimensional (3D) intestinal epithelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> formation assay, we found that KLF4 is essential for cell polarity and crypt-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> formation in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that, as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, KLF4 affects intestinal epithelial cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> by regulating proliferation, differentiation and polarity of the cells </plain></SENT>
