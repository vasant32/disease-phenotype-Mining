<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After rats received 5-FU intravenous (IV) bolus injections, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and elimination half-life (t (1/2)) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> rats (10.02 ± 0.37 μg h mL(-1), 0.30 ± 0.02 h, respectively) were significantly lower than that in control rats (13.46 ± 1.20 μg h mL(-1), 0.52 ± 0.05 h, respectively), whereas total plasma clearance (CL(tot)) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> rats (2.01 ± 0.07 L h(-1) kg(-1)) was significantly increased compared with that in control rats (1.54 ± 0.14 L h(-1) kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the avoidance ratio of the hepatic first-pass effect was approximately 20 % lower than that in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of interest is that hepatic DPD activity levels and the dihydrouracil-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> ratio (UH2/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">Ura</z:chebi> ratio) in plasma, which may act as a potential biomarker to evaluate hepatic DPD activity levels, were significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the decrease of hepatic availability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> rats is brought about by the increase in intrinsic clearance induced by the increase in DPD activity, resulting in a decrease in AUC and t (1/2) and an increase in CL(tot) after 5-FU IV bolus injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Along with a proper dosing regimen for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, a hepatic DPD activity monitoring system, such as the determination of UH2/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">Ura</z:chebi> ratio in plasma, is desirable </plain></SENT>
