<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Failure of mucosal repair often leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, sometimes associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (APC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene regulates the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for epithelial development, and inactivation of APC facilitates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our previous study suggested that APC is involved in pathogenesis of colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>; however, its role in mucosal repair remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> persisted with delayed mucosal repair in Kyoto Apc Delta (KAD) rats lacking the APC C terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Defects in the repair process were accompanied by an absence of a fibrin layer covering damaged mucosa and reduced microvessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APC was up-regulated in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) in inflamed mucosa in KAD and F344 (control) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The VECs of KAD rats revealed elevated cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and low-branched and short-length tube formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found that DLG5, which is associated with IBD pathogenesis, was up-regulated in VECs in inflamed mucosa and interacted with the C terminus of APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that loss of interaction between the APC C terminus and DLG5 affects VEC <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function and leads to persistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, APC is essential for maintenance of intestinal mucosal homeostasis and can consequently contribute to IBD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
