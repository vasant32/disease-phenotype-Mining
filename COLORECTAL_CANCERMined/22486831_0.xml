<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this project was to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) rates in the state of Nevada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Research has shown that there are several interventions for providers to use to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates in practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Nevada <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> Partnership (NCCP) has created a toolkit to assist providers to implement these interventions in practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Research has repeatedly shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening has a great impact on the morbidity and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that a fecal occult blood test can detect 60-85% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and a colonoscopy with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removal can reduce mortality by 60-90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies have shown that a provider's recommendation is the most consistently influential factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, offering patients a choice and encouraging active participation in health care decision making has proven to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The NCCP has collaborated with the American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Society to create a web based toolkit for use by providers to change practice and screen <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eligible patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The toolkit is designed to encourage providers to decrease the morbidity and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The toolkit is useful to facilitate efforts of office-based clinicians to reduce disparities by applying screening guidelines on a universal basis to the age-appropriate population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A team approach to screening is encouraged to promote an opportunistic or global approach to assure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eligible patients are reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As healthcare reform continues to evolve, Nurse Practitioners (NPs) will assume much of the primary care needs of our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A preventive care model is an important aspect of the future of healthcare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>NPs are in a perfect position to change the health of patients in a global way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The strategies and tools presented in this toolkit are designed to improve preventive care and assist the NP in assuring that every eligible patient receives the screening tests they need </plain></SENT>
