<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may be associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To conduct a systematic review of prospective studies assessing the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Relevant studies were identified by a search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases before January 2012, with no restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also reviewed reference lists from retrieved articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We included prospective studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> [measured using body mass index (BMI)] or central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> [measured using waist circumference (WC)] and the risk of colorectal, colon, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately 9, 000, 000 participants from several countries were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>41 studies on general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and 13 studies on central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pooled RRs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> category of BMI were 1.334 (95% CI, 1.253-1.420), and the highest vs. lowest category of WC were 1.455 (95% CI, 1.327-1.596) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among studies of BMI (P&lt;0.001) but not among studies of WC (P=0.323) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both of general and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were positively associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
