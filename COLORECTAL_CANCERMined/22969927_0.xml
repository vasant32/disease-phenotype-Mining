<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study investigated the role of KRAS gene mutations and clinical features for possibilities for new therapies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of unknown primary (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CUP</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF gene mutations and clinical features for possibilities for new therapies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CUP</z:e> </plain></SENT>
