<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although hepatectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) offers prolonged survival in up to 40% of people, recurrence rates are high, approaching 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients experience <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> in the liver after initial hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined our experience with repeat hepatectomy for mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at a single institution who underwent hepatectomy for mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeat hepatectomy was defined as partial liver resection any time after the initial hepatectomy for recurrent mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We estimated time to recurrence and survival by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared outcomes between groups by using the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1998 to 2008, 405 patients underwent hepatectomy for mCRC, and 215 (53%) experienced disease recurrence at a median of 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 150 patients with liver-only or liver-predominant recurrence, 52 (35%) underwent repeat hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to recurrence after repeat hepatectomy was 10 months, and median overall survival was 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one (1.9%) perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and there were 14 (27%) major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival in the repeat hepatectomy group from the time of recurrence after initial hepatectomy was 22 months, compared with 15 months in the 98 patients with liver recurrence who were not selected for repeat hepatectomy (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Repeat hepatectomy for mCRC is feasible in highly selected patients, with acceptable perioperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although repeat hepatectomy should be considered, recurrence rates are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the initial hepatectomy for mCRC is potentially curative, recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> in the liver is unlikely to be cured </plain></SENT>
