<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated associations of functional genetic polymorphisms of methionine synthase (MTR), MTR reductase (MTRR), and thymidylate synthase (TS) with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study subjects were 455 cases of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 1052 controls with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> at colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined for MTR A2756G, MTRR A66G and two polymorphisms in the TS gene, 28-bp tandem repeat polymorphism in the promoter enhancer region (TSER) and 6-bp deletion polymorphism at position 1494 in the 3' untranslated region (TS 1494del6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined the alcohol-genotype and gene-gene interactions on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GG genotype of MTR A2756G was associated with an increased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>; odds ratios for AG and GG versus AA genotype were 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.78-1.26) and 1.72 (1.04-2.82), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in the risk associated with MTR 2756GG genotype was evident in men with high alcohol consumption (â‰¥30 mL/d), but not in those with low alcohol consumption (interaction P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men who were homozygous for the TSER double-repeat allele had a slightly decreased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> as compared with those homozygous for the TSER triple-repeat allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither MTRR A66G nor TS 1494del6 was associated with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no measurable interaction either between MTR A2756G and MTRR A66G or between TSER and TS 1494del6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MTR A2756G appears to be associated with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk differently according to alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The MTR-catalyzed reaction may play an important role in the development of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
