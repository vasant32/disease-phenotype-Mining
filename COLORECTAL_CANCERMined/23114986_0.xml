<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reovirus is a promising oncolytic virus, acting by both direct and immune-mediated mechanisms, although its potential may be limited by inactivation after systemic delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study addressed whether systemically delivered reovirus might be shielded from neutralising antibodies by cell carriage and whether virus-loaded blood or hepatic innate immune effector cells become activated to kill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells metastatic to the liver in human systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that reovirus was directly cytotoxic against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells but not against fresh hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell killing by neat virus was significantly reduced in the presence of neutralising serum, reovirus was protected when loaded onto peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which may carry virus after intravenous administration in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As well as handing off virus for direct oncolytic killing, natural killer (NK) cells within reovirus-treated blood mononuclear cells were stimulated to kill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> targets, but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hepatocytes, in a Type I interferon-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, NK cells within liver mononuclear cells became selectively cytotoxic towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells when activated by reovirus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, intravenous reovirus may evade neutralisation by serum via binding to circulating mononuclear cells, and this blood cell carriage has the potential to investigate both direct and innate immune-mediated therapy against human colorectal or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> metastatic to the liver </plain></SENT>
