<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Patients can rapidly access the internet and more young people are using their mobile to access health-related information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to assess the readability and quality of colorectal disease websites for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the Google, Yahoo and Bing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Readability was assessed using Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), Flesch-Kincaid Grade (FKG) and Gunning Fog Index (GFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LIDA tool and DISCERN instrument were used to measure the design and content of health information on the Internet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A sub-group analysis was performed on websites certified by HONcode and Information Standard against non-certified websites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean FRES were 56.3, mean FKG of 6.9, mean GFI of 9.5, equivalent to TIME magazine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean LIDA Tool overall score was 85.6% and mean DISCERN instrument was 52.2 (95% CI 45-59.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> websites were readable but potentially unreliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Government certified sites were superior to non-certified sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvements are required to provide patients with reliable information to make informed decisions on medical treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose that national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> services develop reliable and easily readable information regarding the diagnosis and investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The site should provide adequate information regarding the treatment options and importantly how each treatment option would affect the patient's quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinicians can then provide these websites to the patients before and after their consultations to allow the patient to be fully informed </plain></SENT>
