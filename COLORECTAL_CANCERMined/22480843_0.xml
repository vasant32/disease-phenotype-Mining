<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prognostic marker could improve patient selection and lower recurrence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Micro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">ribonucleic acids</z:chebi> (miRNAs), small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that often inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors, have shown prognostic potential in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that high miRNA levels in malignant tissue from early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients could predict recurrence after local excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 17 early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with local excision between 1990 and 2005, four of whom had recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from benign and malignant tissue and used in quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to probe for miR-20a, miR-21, miR-106a, miR-181b, and miR-203 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MiRNA data were evaluated for association with recurrence using univariate analysis with Wilcoxon rank sum test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Malignant tissue in both patients who had recurrences and patients who did not have recurrences had equivalently high levels of miRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the benign tissue of patients who recurred contained significantly higher levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five miRNAs when compared with the benign tissue of nonrecurrent patients despite having no histological differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that high miRNA levels of histologically benign tissue obtained from the surgical margin of locally excised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> can predict recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The malignant miRNA levels did not have predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of miRNAs is needed to explore their potential for a more accurate prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
