<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given that most of the literature data are contradictory with respect to the cytotoxicity of these drugs and DNA adduct formation, the present study aimed to determine some of the potential underlying mechanisms in view of their cellular uptakes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the cytotoxicity, DNA cross-link formation, and cellular uptake of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in Colo320, HT-29, and Caco-2 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed higher cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in Colo320 (P&lt;0.05) and HT-29 cell lines and of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> in Caco-2 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi> induced more DNA cross-links than <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent manner in Colo320 cells (P&lt;0.0001); in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, the induction of DNA damage was not dose dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple accumulation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell types, doses, and time points we tested </plain></SENT>
