<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomly invited 8,844 people for screening by colonoscopy or CT colonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On a questionnaire, invitees indicated reasons for participation or nonparticipation and indicated the most decisive reason </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most frequently cited reasons to accept screening were early detection of precursor lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and contribution to science </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequently cited reasons to decline were the unpleasantness of the examination, the inconvenience of the preparation, a lack of symptoms, and "no time/too much effort." Among colonoscopy nonparticipants, elderly invitees cited inconvenience less often, and absence of symptoms more often, than did the group overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reason reported most frequently as the most decisive reason not to participate was the unpleasantness of the examination among colonoscopy nonparticipants, and "no time/too much effort" and lack of symptoms among CT colonography nonparticipants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In light of these results, future screening programs could tailor the information provided to invitees </plain></SENT>
