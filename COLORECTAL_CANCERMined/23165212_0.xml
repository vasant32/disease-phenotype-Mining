<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This glycosylase activity has also been found to be critical for active demethylation of genes involved in embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 transcriptionally regulates TDG expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase assays indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 binds to a domain of TDG promoter containing two p53 consensus response elements (p53RE) and activates its transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, we have used a panel of cell lines with different p53 status to demonstrate that TDG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels are induced in a p53-dependent manner under different conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This panel includes isogenic breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or inactive p53, esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> cell lines lacking p53 or expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bronchial epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction of TDG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is accompanied by accumulation of TDG protein in both nucleus and cytoplasm, with nuclear re-localization occurring upon DNA damage in p53-competent, but not -incompetent, cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest a role for p53 activity in TDG nuclear translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results show that TDG expression is directly regulated by p53, suggesting that loss of p53 function may affect processes mediated by TDG, thus negatively impacting on genetic and epigenetic stability </plain></SENT>
