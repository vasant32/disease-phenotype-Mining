<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> rather than the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> itself is the main determinant of patient's survival, the 'Liver-First Approach (LFA)' with upfront chemotherapy followed by a hepatic resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) and finally a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review was to analyse the evidence for LFA in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and synchronous CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search of databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) to identify published studies of LFA in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and synchronous CLM was undertaken focussing on the peri-operative regimens of LFA and survival outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three observational studies and one retrospective cohort study were included for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 121 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and synchronous CLM were selected for LFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative chemotherapy was used in 99% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twelve of the initial 121 patients (93%) underwent a hepatic resection of CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, 60% had a major liver resection and the R0 resection rate was 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-operative morbidity and mortality after the hepatic resection were 20% and 1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, 89 of the initial 121 (74%) patients underwent a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-operative morbidity and mortality after a colorectal resection were 50% and 6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 40 months (range 19-50) with a recurrence rate of 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that LFA is safe and feasible in selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and synchronous CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future studies are required to further define patient selection criteria for LFA and the exact role of LFA in the management of synchronous CLM </plain></SENT>
