<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several molecular events involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active inflammatory processes contribute to multistage progression of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, aberrant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites and cytokines/growth factors, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These molecular events in IBD lead to genetic abnormality and promote aberrant cell proliferation, which further lead to epithelial changes encompassing a broad spectrum from <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Objective.-To review the (1) epidemiologic and molecular pathogenesis of the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in IBD, (2) morphologic characterization, biomarker(s), and classification of dysplastic lesions, and (3) clinical management of dysplastic lesions arising in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data Sources.-The different IBD-related dysplastic lesions are illustrated by using <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in conjunction with molecular pathways, and the "field cancerization" theory and its potential significance are discussed with a review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusions.-Patients with IBD are at increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is related to the extent/duration/activity of the patient's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is no consensus regarding the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> risk associated with IBD; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> would agree that patients with IBD represent a group at significant risk for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and as such, warrant adequate surveillance and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With better screening modalities and detection/characterization of dysplastic lesions, IBD-associated serrated lesions, and "field cancerization," we will improve our understanding of and approach to risk stratification </plain></SENT>
