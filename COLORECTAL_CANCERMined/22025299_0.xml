<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the post-genomic era, the main aim of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> research is organizing the large amount of data on gene expression and protein abundance into a meaningful biological context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Performing integrated analysis of genomic and proteomic data sets is a challenging task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To comprehensively assess the correlation between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression, we focused on the gene set enrichment analysis, a recently described powerful analytical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the differentially expressed proteins in 12 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue samples were considered a collective set, they exhibited significant concordance with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> gene expression data in 180 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that 53 upregulated proteins were significantly enriched in genes exhibiting elevated gene expression levels (P&lt;0.001, ES=0.53), indicating a positive correlation between the proteomic and transcriptomic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 44 downregulated proteins were significantly enriched in genes exhibiting elevated gene expression levels (P&lt;0.001, ES -0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we applied gene set enrichment analysis to identify functional genetic pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A relatively large number of upregulated proteins were related to the two principal pathways; ECM receptor interaction was related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> 2 and vitronectin, and ribosome to RPL13, RPL27A, RPL4, RPS18, and RPS29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the integrated understanding of both genomic and proteomic data sets can lead to a better understanding of functional inference at the physiological level and potential molecular targets in clinical settings </plain></SENT>
