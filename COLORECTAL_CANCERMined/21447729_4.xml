<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We determined the gene copy numbers for MET, for its transcriptional activator MACC1 and for its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We correlated copy numbers with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and explored whether gain and/or overexpression of MET and MACC1 predict response to anti-Met therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finally, we assessed whether their genomic or transcriptional deregulation correlates with pathologic and molecular parameters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred three mCRCs were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Copy numbers and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty nine samples were implanted and expanded in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e> (nonobese diabetic)/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> (severe combined immunodeficient) mice to generate cohorts that were treated with the Met inhibitor JNJ-38877605 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In silico analysis of MACC1 targets relied on genome-wide mapping of promoter regions and on expression data from two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No focal, high-grade amplifications of MET, MACC1, or HGF were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 7 polysomy and gain of the p-arm were observed in 21% and 8% of cases, respectively, and significantly correlated with higher expression of both Met and MACC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Met inhibition in patient-derived xenografts did not modify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Copy number gain and overexpression of MACC1 correlated with unfavorable pathologic features better than overexpression of Met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic analysis of putative MACC1 targets identified elements besides Met, whose overexpression cosegregated with aggressive forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Experiments in patient-derived xenografts suggest that mCRCs do not rely on Met genomic gain and/or overexpression for growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the basis of pathologic correlations and bioinformatic analysis, MACC1 could contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression through mechanisms other than or additional to Met transcriptional upregulation </plain></SENT>
