<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated follow-up of patients with sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> diagnosed between 2002 and 2004 in our teaching institution and compared it to follow-up of randomly selected tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials from patients diagnosed with sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> from January 2002 to December 2004 were reviewed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> from 93 patients were diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty three patients (46.2%) had follow-up colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One or more lesions were found in 42 (97.6%) of 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was diagnosed in 1 (2.3%) of 43 patients, and 1 (2.3%) of 43 patients had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in an sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were found in 22 (51.2%) of 43 patients, 16 (37.2%) of 43 patients had tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> were diagnosed in 18 (41.9%) of 43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two patients with tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> between January 2002 and December 2004 formed the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients (71.7%) received follow-up colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most (53/66, 80.3%) patients had tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> on follow-up, 12 (18.2%) of 66 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath>, and 2 (3.0%) of 66 patients had a sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The follow-up of sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> from the study period (2002 to 2004) was more rigorous than proposed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were also followed up more aggressively than suggested by guidelines) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that guidelines for following up patients with sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> as per advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> are warranted </plain></SENT>
