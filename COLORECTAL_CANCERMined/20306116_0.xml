<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 elderly (70-85 years old) and frail [Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 2 and 65-69 years old] patients were eligible for first-line S-1 of 35 mg/m(2) given twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate (ORR) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the ORR for frail and elderly patients was 22% and 18%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were 3.9 months (95% CI, 3.0-4.8) and 11.3 months (95% CI, 7.4-15.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For frail patients, PFS was 1.4 (95% CI, 0.8-2.0) vs. 4.3 months (95% CI, 3.0-5.4) for the elderly (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OS was significantly longer for elderly patients than for frail patients (13.1 months, 95% CI, 9.5-16.7) vs. (4.1 months, 95% CI, 3.2-5.0; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mild to moderate, as only 29% of patients experienced grade 3 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 4 toxicity and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> did not occur; however, two frail patients died from grade 5 treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Generally, S-1 monotherapy was well-tolerated and efficacious in the elderly patient group, but not in the frail patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering performance status and co-morbidities in patients &gt;70 years old, S-1 monotherapy may be a first-line therapeutic option for elderly mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
