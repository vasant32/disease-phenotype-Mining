<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to confirm the association between SMAD7 SNPs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in the multi-center <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> Family Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 23 tagging SNPs in the SMAD7 gene were genotyped among 1,592 population-based and 253 clinic-based families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SNP-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associations were assessed in multivariable conditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the population-based families, both SNPs rs12953717 (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.49), and rs11874392 (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.92) were associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations were similar among the population- and the clinic-based families, though they were significant only among the former </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marginally significant differences in the SNP-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associations were observed by use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, cigarette smoking, body mass index, and history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SMAD7 SNPs were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> Family Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was evidence suggesting that the association between rs12953717 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk may be modified by factors such as smoking and use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
