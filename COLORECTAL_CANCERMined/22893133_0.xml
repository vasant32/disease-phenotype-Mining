<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: In France, in about 5% of cases colonoscopies are incomplete or temporarily contraindicated.We tested the diagnostic yield of colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, in 17 French centers, inclusion criteria were colonoscopy failure or general disease that excluded colonoscopy with anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent CCE using the first-generation PillCam Colon capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main end point was CCE diagnostic yield, defined as identification of a colorectal lesion that directly explained symptoms or necessitated a diagnostic or therapeutic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A secondary objective was to test a simplified Movi-Prep colon cleansing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up to identify missed symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was scheduled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CCE showed positive findings in 36 patients (diagnostic yield 33.6 %), among whom 23 subsequently underwent therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 64 patients with negative capsule findings, 9 had a complementary procedure showing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in only 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CCE was incomplete in 7/107 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was done in one patient to retrieve a capsule retained in the left colon, and sigmoidoscopy in 11 because the rectum was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was diagnosed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colon cleansing with MoviPrep was rated good or excellent in 75.9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows the feasibility and the usefulness of CCE in the situation of colonoscopy failure or contraindication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The colon capsule modality should be tested against other available approaches, such as virtual colonoscopy or repeat colonoscopy by an expert </plain></SENT>
