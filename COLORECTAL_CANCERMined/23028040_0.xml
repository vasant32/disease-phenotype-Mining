<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This secondary analysis assessed the relationship of the CTC number with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with mCRC had CTCs measured at baseline and specific time points after the initiation of new therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a baseline CEA value ≥ 10 ng/ml and CEA measurements within ± 30 days of the CTC collection were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 217 patients with mCRC who had a CEA value of ≥ 10 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased baseline CEA was associated with shorter survival (15.8 versus 20.7 months, P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a baseline CEA value of ≥ 25 ng/ml, patients with low baseline CTCs (&lt;3, n = 99) had longer survival than those with high CTCs (≥ 3, n = 58; 20.8 versus 11.7 months, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTCs added prognostic information at the 3-5- and 6-12-week time points regardless of CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, CTCs at baseline but not CEA independently predicted survival and both CTCs and CEA independently predicted survival at 6-12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that both CEA and CTCs contribute prognostic information for patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
