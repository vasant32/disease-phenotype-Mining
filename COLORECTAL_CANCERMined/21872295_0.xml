<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common event in the perioperative course of patients undergoing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transfused blood can disrupt the balance of coagulation factors and modulates the inflammatory cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and coagulation are tightly coupled, we postulated that RBC transfusion may be associated with the development of venous thromboembolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We queried the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database to examine the relationship between intraoperative blood transfusion and development of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) in patients undergoing colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the data from 2005 to 2009 for patients undergoing colorectal resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> based on the primary procedure <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-4 code and operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 diagnosis code </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative transfusion of RBC's was categorized as: none, 1-2 units, 3-5 units and 6 units or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DVT/PE occurrences were analyzed by multivariable forward stepwise regression (p for entry&lt;.05, for exit&gt;.10) to identify independent predictors of DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The database contained 21943 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DVT rate was 1.4% (306/21943) and the PE rate was 0.8% (180/21943) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients were diagnosed with both only 40 times and the combined DVT or PE rate (VTE) was 2.0% (446/21943) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, gender, race, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class, emergency procedure, operative duration and complexity of the procedure (based on Relative Value Units, RVU's), along with six clinical risk factors, intraoperative blood transfusion was a significant risk factor for the development of VTE and the risk increased with increasing number of units transfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Preoperative hematocrit did not enter the multivariable model as an independent predictor of VTE, nor did open versus laparoscopic resection or wound class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study of 21943 patients undergoing colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, blood transfusion is associated with increased risk of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignancy</z:e> and surgery are known prothrombotic stimuli, the subset of patients receiving intraoperative RBC transfusion are even more at risk for VTE, emphasizing the need for sensible use of transfusions and rigorous thromboprophylaxis regimens </plain></SENT>
