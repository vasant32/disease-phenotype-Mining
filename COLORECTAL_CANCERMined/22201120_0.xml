<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients harbored <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1*1/*1, *1/*6, or *1/*28 genotypes, which are associated with similar irinotecan pharmacokinetics and responses to FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphisms were analyzed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate and median progression-free survival in a total of 61 patients were 43% and 7.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was higher in patients with the CC genotype at -24 in ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C, and member 2 (ABCC2) than in the others (p = 0.0313) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was the longest in patients with CC at -24 in ABCC2, followed by those with CT and TT (p = 0.00910) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clear gene-dose effect was seen between -24C&gt;T and median progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other polymorphisms tested were related to the efficacy of FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We thus found that the -24C&gt;T polymorphism in the ABCC2 gene was significantly associated with the efficacy of first-line FOLFIRI in Japanese patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
