<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In recent years, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> have been found to be cogent as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in mitigating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, this present investigation was aimed to formulate an oral, targeted tablet of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> microspheres for sustained and targeted adjuvant therapy for <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colonic adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Crosslinked guar gum microspheres of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> were directly compressed into matrix tablet and coated with Eudragit S100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optimized tablet that displayed 0% release in simulated gastric fluid, 15% in simulated intestinal fluid and 97.1% in simulated colonic fluid underwent roentgenographic study in rabbits to check its safe transit to the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>x-ray images revealed intactness of the tablet until it reached the colon where the tablet matrix eroded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The designed, conceptual formulation emerged as potential carrier for targeted adjuvant therapy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
