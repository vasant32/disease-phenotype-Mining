<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the cell cycle state of CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells, isolated from primary human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: After mechanical and enzymatic dissociation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, CD133(+) and CD133(-) subsets were identified and separated by magnetic cell sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis was performed to compare the cell cycle of both CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells isolated from primary and liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results indicated that CD133(+) cells isolated from both primary and liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancers</z:e> were found in higher percentage in the G0/G1 phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the CD133(-) cells isolated from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were predominantly found in the S and G2/M phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the CD133(-) cells isolated from liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancers</z:e> were mostly found in the G0/G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that CD133(+) cells are in a quiescent state in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, representing a mechanism that would at least partially explain chemotherapy resistance and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence in post-therapy patients </plain></SENT>
