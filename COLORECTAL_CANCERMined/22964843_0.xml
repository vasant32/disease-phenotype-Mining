<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the value and cost of a QDU and of conventional hospitalization in assessing patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a descriptive cohort study, 169 patients with a final diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were prospectively evaluated between November 2008 and April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed a retrospective cohort of 53 randomly selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> hospitalized during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the variables time to diagnosis and length of stay, we compared the costs of both models using microcosting techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> was the commonest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QDU patients were younger than hospitalized patients (68.3 vs. 74.7 years; p &lt; 0.05), and there were also significant differences with respect to the source of referral (p &lt; 0.00001) and destination (p &lt; 0.00001), but not regarding diagnosis (p &gt; 0.34), reason for consultation (p &gt; 0.26) and time to diagnosis/length of stay (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean costs for hospitalization were EUR 4,059.37 compared with EUR 601.84 in the QDU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For diagnostic purposes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients can be managed similarly in a QDU or in in-hospital settings, but the QDU model seems to incur fewer costs </plain></SENT>
