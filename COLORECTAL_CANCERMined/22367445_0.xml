<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection is safe and effective when compared with the open approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are only a few reports with small numbers of patients on laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from consecutive patients who underwent palliative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 2006 and December 2007 were collected retrospectively from 41 institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between patients who underwent laparoscopic or open resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 904 patients (laparoscopic group: 226, open group: 678) with a median age of 64 years (range: 22-95) were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversion was required in 28 patients (12.4%) and the most common reasons for conversion (23/28: 82%) were bulky or invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no 30-day postoperative mortality in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The complication rate (NCI-CTCAE grade 2-4) after laparoscopic surgery (17%) was significantly lower than that after open surgery (24%) (P = 0.02), and the difference was greater (4% vs 12%; P &lt; 0.001) when we limited the analysis to severe (â‰¥grade 3) complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median length of postoperative hospital stay in the laparoscopic group was significantly shorter than that in the open group (14 vs 17 days; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, overall survival for the laparoscopic group was significantly better than that for open surgery (median survival time: 25.9 vs 22.3 months, P = 0.04), although no difference was apparent in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection has advantages in the short term and no disadvantages in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is a reasonable treatment option for certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with incurable disease </plain></SENT>
