<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Members of the human kallikrein-related peptidases gene family represent potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of human tissue kallikrein-related peptidase 10 (KLK10) by immunohistochemistry in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, to correlate this expression with various histopathological and clinical variables, and to evaluate its significance as a predictor of disease outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KLK10 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and a combined expression score was calculated for each case based on intensity and percentage of positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant positive association was observed between KLK10 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (p = 0.015 and p = 0.035, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, a negative association was observed between KLK10 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves and univariate analysis showed that both KLK10 expression and stage had statistically significant correlations with disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.030 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and overall survival (p = 0.010 and p = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox multivariate analysis showed that both KLK10 expression and stage were independent predictors of unfavorable DFS (p = 0.057 and p = 0.001, respectively) and overall survival (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, KLK10 immunostaining is an independent prognostic marker in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
