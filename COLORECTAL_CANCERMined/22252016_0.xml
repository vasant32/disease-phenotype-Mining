<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A promising approach to determine the nature of these is to activate silent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26619">secondary metabolite</z:chebi> gene clusters through constitutive expression of cluster specific transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a system in which an expression cassette containing the transcription factor from the targeted PKS cluster disrupts the production of the red mycelium pigment aurofusarin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The system was used for constitutive expression of the local transcription factor from the PKS9 cluster (renamed FSL) leading to production of three novel fusarielins, F, G and H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This group of compounds has not previously been reported from F.â€ƒgraminearum or linked to a biosynthetic gene in any fungal species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of the three novel fusarielins was examined against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines where fusarielin H was more potent than fusarielin F and G </plain></SENT>
