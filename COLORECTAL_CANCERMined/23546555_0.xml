<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeat FOBT adherence may be especially low in community health center (CHC) settings, where many patients face barriers to annual FOBT completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to investigate adherence to annual FOBT in an urban CHC network that serves a predominantly Spanish-speaking, uninsured adult patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study used data from the two-year period between January 2010 and December 2011, and included adults aged 50-74 who completed a screening FOBT with a negative result during the first 6 months of 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined whether each patient completed a second FOBT between 9 and 18 months after the initial negative FOBT, and tested whether repeat FOBT adherence was associated with patient characteristics or the number of clinic visits after the initial negative FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 69 of 281 included patients completed repeat FOBT (24.6 % adherence), and none of 62 patients (0 %) with 0 clinic visits completed repeat FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We detected no significant differences in adherence by age, sex, preferred language, insurance status, or number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable regression, the adjusted relative risk of repeat FOBT was 1.66 (95 % CI 1.09-2.54; p = 0.02) among patients with 3 or more clinic visits (referent: patients with 1-2 visits) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed low rate of adherence greatly diminishes the effectiveness of FOBT in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings demonstrate the need for systems-based interventions that increase adherence without requiring face-to-face encounters </plain></SENT>
