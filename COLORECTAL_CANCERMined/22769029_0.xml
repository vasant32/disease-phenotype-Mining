<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To analyse the individual risk factors and to determine which patients would benefit more from the use of prophylactic measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on the demographic and surgical data, as well as the complications, risk factors and outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery in the period between January 2006 and September 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> was made by means of physical examination or by a review of the follow up CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 338 patients were reviewed (249 laparotomy and 89 laparoscopy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 19.7 months, 87 patients (25.7%) were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> by a physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CT scan enabled 48 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> (14.2%) not detected clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> rate was 39.9% (135 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between patients subjected to laparotomy (40.9%) or laparoscopy (37.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> rate in overweight patients (BMI ��� 25 Kg/m(2)), was 51.3% compared to 31.1% in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-surgical complications (P=.007), surgical wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (P=.04), and further surgery during the post-operative period (P&lt;.0001), was also associated with a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection is higher than expected (39,9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with a BMI greater than 25 kg/m(2), and those who require further surgery are candidates to receive a prophylactic mesh </plain></SENT>
