<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short hospital stay and equal or reduced complication rates have been demonstrated after fast track open colonic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, fast track principles of perioperative care can be difficult to implement and often require increased nursing staff because of more concentrated nursing tasks during the shorter hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific data on nursing requirements after laparoscopic surgery are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of operative technique (open versus laparoscopic operation), but without changing nurse staffing or principles for peri- or postoperative care, that is, without implementing fast track principles, on length of stay after colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients operated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from November 2004 to December 2008 in our department were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No specific patients were selected for laparoscopic repair, which was solely dependent on the presence of two specific surgeons at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the patients were not selected for laparoscopic repair based on patient-related factors, but only on the simultaneous presence of two specific surgeons on the day of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 540 included patients, 213 (39%) were operated by a laparoscopic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay for patients with a primary anastomosis was significantly shorter after laparoscopic than after conventional open surgery (5 versus 8 days, P &lt; 0.001) while there was no difference in patients receiving a stoma (10 versus 10 days, ns), with no changes in the perioperative care regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore there were significant lower blood loss (50 versus 200â€‰mL, P &lt; 0.001) and lower complication rate (21% versus 32%, P = 0.006) in the laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Implementing laparoscopic colorectal surgery in our department resulted in shorter hospital stay without using fast track principles for peri- and postoperative care in patients not receiving a stoma during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we aimed to reduce hospitalisation without increasing cost in nursing staff per hospital bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Length of stay was not reduced in patients receiving a stoma pointing at this group for specific intervention in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the complication rate was reduced in the laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
