<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim was to use newly available data to estimate the cost effectiveness and endoscopy requirements of screening options for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) to inform screening policy in England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A state transition model simulated the life experience of a cohort of individuals in the general population of England with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon/rectal epithelium through to the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> natural history model parameters and screening test characteristics were estimated simultaneously by a process of model calibration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This process was fitted to observed data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence in the absence of screening, data from existing screening programmes, and data from the UK flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The costs, effects and resource impact were evaluated for a range of screening options involving the guaiac or immunochemical faecal occult blood test (gFOBT/iFOBT) and FS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The model suggests that screening strategies involving FS or iFOBT may produce additional benefits compared with the current policy of biennial gFOBT for 60-74-year-olds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age at which a single FS screen results in the greatest quality-adjusted life year gain was 55, with similar gains for ages between 52 and 58 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strategies which combined FS and iFOBT showed further benefits and improved economic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Strategies which combine different screening modalities may provide greater clinical and economic benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The collection of comprehensive screening data using a uniform format will enable comparative analysis across screening programmes in different countries, will improve our understanding of the disease and will allow identification of optimal screening modalities </plain></SENT>
