<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the potential of APC/β-catenin signaling pathway markers as treatable, preneoplastic biomarkers of risk for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, we conducted a pilot colonoscopy-based case-control study (51 cases and 154 controls) of incident, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated APC, β-catenin, and E-cadherin expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa from the rectum and ascending and sigmoid colon using automated immunohistochemical and quantitative image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diet, lifestyle, and medical history were assessed with validated questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rectal mucosa, the ratio of the proportion of APC expression in the upper 40% of crypts with total β-catenin expression (APC/β-catenin score) was 14.3% greater in controls than in cases [P = 0.02; OR, 0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-1.14] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, in cases, APC expression was 3.2% lower, β-catenin expression was 3.0% higher, and E-cadherin expression was 0.7% lower; however, none of these differences were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The APC/β-catenin score statistically significantly differed according to categories of plausible risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> [e.g., it was 17.7% higher among those with 25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) concentrations ≥ 27 ng/mL] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that the combined expression of APC and β-catenin in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rectal mucosa may be associated with risk for incident, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, as well as with modifiable risk factors for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Impact: Our results may help advance the development of treatable, preneoplastic biomarkers of risk for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
