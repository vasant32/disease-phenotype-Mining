<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The CXC-chemokine expression is linked with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) progression but their significance in resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the prognostic impact of such expression in stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue microarrays were constructed from stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biopsies (n=254), and the expression of CXCL1 and CXCL8, and their receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, in malignant and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue was graded by immunohistochemistry and was correlated with prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of CXCL1, CXCR1 and CXCR2 was elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> epithelium relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent tissue (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CXCL8 expression was detectable in the peritumoural inflammatory infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no overall association between CXCL1, CXCR1 or CXCR2 expression and prognostic endpoints; however, univariate subgroup survival analysis demonstrated an inverse association between CXCL1 and recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) in stage III patients (P=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CXCL8 positivity in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> infiltrate, however, correlated with earlier disease stage (P&lt;0.001) and improved relapse-free survival across the cohort (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease stage (P&lt;0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> infiltrate CXCL8 positivity (P=0.007) were associated with enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> in multivariate Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Autocrine CXC-chemokine signalling may have adverse prognostic effects in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, CXCL8 positivity within the immune infiltrate may have good prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
