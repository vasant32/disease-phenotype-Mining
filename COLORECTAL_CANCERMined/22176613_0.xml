<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Following the introduction of a 2-week-wait (2ww) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> pathway, many units are triaging patients with change in bowel habit (CIBH) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> (RB) straight to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> does not present with these symptoms, hence imaging the left colon only is satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If this were substantiated, patients could be offered a flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to review presenting symptoms of patients diagnosed with a right-sided colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and assess whether their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> would be missed based on this practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This is a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent curative resection for a proximal colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> over a 4-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-week-wait referral proforma and case notes were analysed for mode of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 206 elective right hemicolectomies performed, 20/206 (9.7%) patients presented in the absence of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> or palpable abdominal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> identified in the left colon and eight patients had no left-sided colonic pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had a strong family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (two first-degree relatives) in the group absent of left-sided pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Twelve patients who had left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> and one patient with a strong family history would have undergone whole colonic imaging based on current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> management guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining seven patients with right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> would have been missed if FS were the only investigation used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting on the 2ww with symptoms of a CIBH and/or RB can be adequately investigated with a FS with a 3% chance of missing a proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
