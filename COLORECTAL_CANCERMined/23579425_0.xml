<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adherence to Mediterranean diet was expressed through two 10-unit scales, the Modified Mediterranean diet score (MMDS) and the Centre-Specific MMDS (CSMMDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both scales share the same dietary components but differ in the cut-off values that were used for these components in the construction of the scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for the associations of these scales with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 5,296,617 person-years of follow-up, 4,355 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, of 8 and 11 % was estimated when comparing the highest (scores 6-9) with the lowest (scores 0-3) adherence to CSMMDS and MMDS respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For MMDS the HR was 0.89 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.80, 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 2-unit increment in either Mediterranean scale was associated with a borderline statistically significant 3 to 4 % reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (HR for MMDS: 0.96; 95 % CI: 0.92, 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were somewhat more evident, among women, were mainly manifested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk and their magnitude was not altered when alcohol was excluded from MMDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that following a Mediterranean diet may have a modest beneficial effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
