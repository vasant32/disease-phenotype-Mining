<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Research examining body mass index (BMI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening has had mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clearer understanding of the extent to which high-BMI subgroups are screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is needed to inform planning for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening promotions targeting BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from a random, population-based sample of women and men at average-risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (aged 50-75 years) during 2004 (n = 1098) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate whether BMI category was significantly associated with the probability of reporting recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and with the probability of agreeing with statements denoting attitudes/perceptions about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Attitudes/perceptions about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening were evaluated as potential mediators and moderators of the association between BMI category and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for characteristics associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women were each 40% less likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening than women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-BMI (OR = 0.6, 95% CI:0.4-0.9 and OR = 0.6, 95% CI:0.3-0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMI category was unrelated to screening among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> women (but not men) were less aware than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-BMI women that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 0.5, 95% CI:0.3-0.9) and less worried about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 0.5, 95% CI:0.3-0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, findings suggest that attitudes/perceptions about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening did not mediate or moderate the association between BMI category and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women are at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> because of their greater BMI and their propensity not to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Study findings suggest that potentially modifiable perceptions, e.g., lack of awareness of risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and less worry about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, in this subgroup may not explain the relationship between BMI category and reduced screening </plain></SENT>
