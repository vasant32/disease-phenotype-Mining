<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability to predict which patients may be at 'high risk' of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> could have major implications on patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histomorphological, immunohistochemical or molecular biomarkers are currently being investigated in order to test their potential value as predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas covered: Here, the author reviews the clinical and functional data supporting the investigation of three novel promising biomarkers for the prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding, Raf1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-associated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>-1 (MACC1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expert opinion: The lifespan of most potential biomarkers is short as evidenced by the rare cases that have successfully made their way into daily practice such as KRAS or microsatellite instability (MSI) status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the three biomarkers reviewed herein have the potential to become important predictive biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, they have similar hurdles to overcome before they can be implemented into clinical management: standardization and validation in prospective patient cohorts </plain></SENT>
