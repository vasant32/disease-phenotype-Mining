<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-three non-consanguineous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients admitted to the Department of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three peripheral venous blood samples, of approximately one milliliter from each patient, were collected between December 2009 and August 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genomic DNA of these peripheral venous blood samples were extracted and purified using a Fermentas Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Fermentas, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the liver-intestine cadherin (CDH17) gene c.343A&gt;G and c.2216A&gt;C were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method (PCR-SSCP) in 93 peripheral venous blood samples from patients suffering with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Typical samples that showed different migration bands in SSCP were confirmed by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Directed DNA sequencing was used to check the correctness of the genotype results from the PCR-SSCP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant association between the c.2216 A&gt;C SNPs of the CDH17 gene and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-node-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (TNM) grade, as well as with lymph node status, in 93 peripheral venous blood samples from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies of A/C, A/A, and C/C were 12.90%, 33.33% and 53.76%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, TNM grade, and the genotype distribution (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The C/C genotype raised the risk of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and the TNM grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the TNM grade and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> between the A/A and C/C genotypes (P = 0.003 and P = 0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> carrying the C allele tended to have a higher risk of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and have a higher TNM grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The difference between the TNM grades, as well as the lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of the two alleles, was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The SNPs of the CDH17 gene c.2216 A&gt;C might be clinically important in the prognosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
