<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing radical pulmonary resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at our institution were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic variables including sex, age, site and stage of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, disease-free interval, prior hepatic resection, timing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e>, preoperative chemotherapy, type of pulmonary resection, number, size, and location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e>, and thoracic lymph node involvement were retrospectively collected and investigated for prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier technique and difference between factors were evaluated by the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 127 patients undergoing pulmonary resection between 1997 and 2009 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 67.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival from the time of pulmonary resection was 48.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival was 45.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated prognostic variables, the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> (1 vs &gt;1) was the most important factor affecting the outcome after pulmonary resection (5-year overall survival 55.4% vs 32.2%; hazard rate, 1.92; P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the presence of a single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> was a favorable predictor of survival after complete pulmonary resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the other prognostic variables did not seem to affect survival and should not contraindicate such surgery in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the study sample size does not allow us to draw any definitive conclusion, and further investigation of the role of these prognostic factors in larger series is warranted </plain></SENT>
