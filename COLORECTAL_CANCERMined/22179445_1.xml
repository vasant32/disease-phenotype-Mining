<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite being considered the most effective method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis, colonoscopy take-up as a mass-screening procedure is limited mainly due to invasiveness, patient discomfort, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233702" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of pain</z:e>, and the need for sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an effort to mitigate some of the disadvantages associated with colonoscopy, this work provides a preliminary assessment of a novel endoscopic device consisting in a softly tethered capsule for painless colonoscopy under robotic magnetic steering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The proposed platform consists of the endoscopic device, a robotic unit, and a control box </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the traditional insertion method (i.e., pushing from behind), a "front-wheel" propulsion approach is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A compliant tether connecting the device to an external box is used to provide insufflation, passing a flexible operative tool, enabling lens cleaning, and operating the vision module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the diagnostic and treatment ability of the platform, 12 users were asked to find and remove artificially implanted beads as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> surrogates in an ex vivo model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo testing consisted of a qualitative study of the platform in pigs, focusing on active locomotion, diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities, safety, and usability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean percentage of beads identified by each user during ex vivo trials was 85 ± 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the identified beads were removed successfully using the polypectomy loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean completion time for accomplishing the entire procedure was 678 ± 179 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No immediate mucosal damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complications such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, or delayed adverse consequences were observed following application of the proposed method in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of the proposed platform in ex vivo and preliminary animal studies indicates that it is safe and operates effectively in a manner similar to a standard colonoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies served to demonstrate the platform's added advantages of <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>reduced size</z:mp>, front-wheel drive strategy, and robotic control over locomotion and orientation </plain></SENT>
