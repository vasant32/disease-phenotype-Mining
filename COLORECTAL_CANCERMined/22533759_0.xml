<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This difficulty prevents wide spread of the technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Establishment of the training system for colorectal ESD is necessary to standardize training and to achieve wider acceptance of this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we describe our training system for colorectal ESD, and assess the validity of the training system for colorectal ESD, based on the clinical outcomes and learning curve of trainees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our training system for colorectal ESD would help the spread of this procedure </plain></SENT>
