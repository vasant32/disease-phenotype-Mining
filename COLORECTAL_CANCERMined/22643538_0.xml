<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ancillary study was conducted to evaluate the circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell (CTC) count as a prognostic and/or predictive marker for efficacy endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained at baseline and after three cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CTC enumeration was carried out using the CellSearch® System (Veridex LLC, Raritan, NJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scans were performed at cycle 3 and 6 and every 12 weeks thereafter for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median progression-free survival (PFS) interval for patients with a CTC count ≥3 at baseline was 7.8 months, versus the 12.0 months achieved by patients with a CTC count &lt;3 (p = .0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) time was 17.7 months for patients with a CTC count ≥3, compared with 25.1 months for patients with a lower count (p = .0059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After three cycles, the median PFS interval for patients with a low CTC count was 10.8 months, significantly longer than the 7.5 months for patients with a high CTC count (p = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median OS time for patients with a CTC count &lt;3 was significantly longer than for patients with a CTC count ≥3, 25.1 months versus 16.2 months, respectively (p = .0095) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CTC count is a strong prognostic factor for PFS and OS outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
