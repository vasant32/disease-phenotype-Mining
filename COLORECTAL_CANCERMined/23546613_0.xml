<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature search of multiple electronic databases was conducted and complemented by cross-referencing to identify studies published before 31 October 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Every included study was to report risk estimates with 95 % confidence intervals for the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (incidence or mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Core items of identified studies were independently extracted by two reviewers, and results were summarized by standard methods of meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 17 studies, which reported on 49 data sets with 11,462 cancer cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic syndrome</z:e> was associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality in both men (RR: 1.33, 95 % CI 1.18-1.50, and 1.36, 1.25-1.48, respectively) and women (RR: 1.41, 1.18-1.70, and 1.16, 1.03-1.30, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk estimates changed little depending on type of study (cohort vs non cohort), populations (US, Europe, Asia), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site (colon and rectum), or definition of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk estimates for any single factor of the syndrome were significant for higher values of BMI/waist (RR: 1.19, 95 % CI 1.10-1.28), dysglycemia (RR: 1.29, 1.11-1.49), and higher blood pressure (RR: 1.09, 1.01-1.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dysglycemia and/or higher BMI/waist explained most of the risk associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic syndrome</z:e> is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk conveyed by the full syndrome is not superior to the sum of its parts </plain></SENT>
