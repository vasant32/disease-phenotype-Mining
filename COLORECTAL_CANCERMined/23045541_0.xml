<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study examines efficacy of a lay patient navigation (PN) program aimed to reduce time between a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> abnormality and definitive diagnosis among racially/ethnically diverse and medically underserved populations of Tampa Bay, Florida </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a cluster randomized design, the study consisted of 11 clinics (six navigated; five control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were navigated from time of a breast or colorectal abnormality to diagnostic resolution, and to completion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a generalized mixed-effects model to assess intervention effects, we examined: (i) length of time between abnormality and definitive diagnosis, and (ii) receipt of definitive diagnosis within the 6-month minimum follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,267 patients participated (588 navigated; 679 control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also included data from an additional 309 chart abstractions (139 navigated arm; 170 control arm) that assessed outcomes at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PN did not have a significant effect on time to diagnostic resolution in multivariable analysis that adjusted for race-ethnicity, language, insurance status, marital status, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site (P = 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although more navigated patients achieved diagnostic resolution by 180 days, results were not statistically significant (74.5% navigated vs. 68.5% control, P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PN did not impact the overall time to completion of diagnostic care or the number of patients who reached diagnostic resolution of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of PN programs applied to other patient populations across the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> continuum is necessary to gain a better perspective on its effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: PN programs may not impact timely resolution of an abnormality suspicious of breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
