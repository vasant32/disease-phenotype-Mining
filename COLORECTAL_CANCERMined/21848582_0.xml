<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted an in-depth qualitative study of 40 people at least 5 years post-diagnosis of breast, colorectal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each interviewee was asked whether they felt they were a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivor and interpretations of the term were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of respondents did not endorse the term '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivor', and there was a wide variation in its interpretation </plain></SENT>
