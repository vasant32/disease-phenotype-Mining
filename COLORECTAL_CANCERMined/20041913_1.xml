<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Consecutive 2-week referrals for suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> over a period of 2 years from February 2007 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The times to the first diagnostic test and treatment and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> identified were analysed for those going to STT or the outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 662 patients having a 2 wk referral, 519 (78.4%) were suitable for the hospital colorectal telephone triage service, 121 (18.3%) patients went to STT and 502 (75.8%) were seen in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 401 (79.8%) underwent diagnostic tests and 25 (6.2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and in 12 (2.9%) patients other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the STT group, 7 (5.8%) patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to first diagnostic test was 12 days (IQR 9-13) in the STT pathway, compared with 23 days (17-31) in those seen in the clinic (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time to first treatment was 40 (32-48) days for those via STT, compared to 46 (28-55) days for those seen in the clinic (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 162 CRC were diagnosed during the study period of whom 34 (20.9%) were 2 wk referrals (5.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> 2 wk referrals), and 14 (2.1%) other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were detected via this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: STT speeds up the patient pathway by reducing the time to diagnosis and treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
