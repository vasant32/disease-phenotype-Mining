<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calcium and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Ca/Mg) infusions are frequently used to prevent this toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, concerns about a negative impact of Ca/Mg infusions on outcome have been raised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively assessed the effect of Ca/Mg infusions on the incidence of neurotoxicity and on clinical outcome in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (ACC) patients treated in the phase III CAIRO2 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven hundred and fifty five previously untreated ACC patients were randomised between treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and bevacizumab or the same combination with the addition of cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups: patients in the Ca/Mg(+) group received Ca/Mg at least during their first treatment cycle, and patients in the Ca/Mg(-) group did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty two patients were evaluable for this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Ca/Mg(+) group consisted of 551 patients, the Ca/Mg(-) group consisted of 181 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grade neurotoxicity in the Ca/Mg(+) group and the Ca/Mg(-) group was 85% and 92%, respectively (p = 0.02), and the incidence of grade â‰¥ 2 neurotoxicity was 40% and 45%, respectively (p = 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median PFS in the Ca/Mg(+) versus Ca/Mg(-) group was 10.1 versus 10.7 months (p = 0.92), the median OS was 19.8 versus 20.7 months (p = 0.10), and the response rate was 43.1% versus 50% (p = 0.11), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this largest retrospective analysis to date we observed that Ca/Mg infusions significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grade <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-related neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ca/Mg infusions did not affect the clinical efficacy of treatment </plain></SENT>
