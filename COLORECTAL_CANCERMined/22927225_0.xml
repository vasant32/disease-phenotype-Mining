<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients have few treatment options with conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results of sequential radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgical debulking (thermo-surgical ablation) suggest this technique may have benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed a prospective database of patients undergoing thermo-surgical ablation for unresectable colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> from 2003 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients were treated with unresectable, recurrent abdomino-pelvic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>: 11 in pelvis; 4 with isolated aortic/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1335774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroperitoneal disease</z:e>; and 1 with pelvic and peri-adrenal/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1335774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroperitoneal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278554" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent rectal cancer</z:e> and five had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median overall and 3-year actuarial survivals were 15 months and 24%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median and 3-year PFS was 12 months and 19%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients without disease have survived 0.75, 4.0, and 7.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients died at 5.0 and 5.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A disease-free interval (DFI) of &gt;24 months after initial resection was associated with longer overall survival (60 months vs. 4 months; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thermo-surgical debulking appears to have a role in the treatment of some patients with recurrent, unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; those patients with DFI &gt;24 months after initial surgery benefited the most </plain></SENT>
