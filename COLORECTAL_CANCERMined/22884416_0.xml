<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the prognostic value of the diurnal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> rhythm in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lung cancer</z:e> patients (n=62, 34 female) were within 5 years of diagnosis and had primarily <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non small-cell lung cancer</z:e>, with disease stage ranging from early to advanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Saliva collected over two days allowed calculation of the diurnal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> slope and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> awakening response (CAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte numbers and subsets were measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival data were obtained for 57 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox Proportional Hazards analyses were used to test the prognostic value of the diurnal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> rhythm on survival calculated both from study entry and from initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diurnal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> slope predicted subsequent survival over three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early mortality occurred among patients with higher slopes, or relatively "flat" rhythms indicating lack of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diurnal variation (Cox Proportional Hazards p=.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">Cortisol</z:chebi> slope also predicted survival time from initial diagnosis (p=.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Flattened profiles were linked with male gender (t=2.04, df=59, p=.046) and low total and cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte counts (r=-.39 and -.30, p=.004 and .035, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for possible confounding factors, diurnal slope remained a significant, independent predictor of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flattening of the diurnal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> rhythm predicts early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
