<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise mechanism of the regulation of the CEA release from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated if the rate of CEA and another GPI-anchored protein, alkaline phosphatase (AP) release is correlated with cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi> (PA), a compound known to inhibit GPI-PLD activity, on the CEA and AP release from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of CEA, GPI-PLD, and AP in five colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells (LS180, Caco2, SW742, SW1116, and HT29/219) was verified by immunoblot and real-time RT-PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amounts of CEA and AP released into cell culture media were determined using ELISA and a colorimetric assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of PA (20-100 μM) on CEA and AP release from LS180 cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While there was a positive relationship between AP release and the levels of GPI-PLD transcript expression, we found no direct correlation between CEA released from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and the GPI-PLD <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the rate of CEA release was positively associated with the level of CEA transcript expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In comparison to controls, the release of GPI-anchored CEA and AP, but not CA19-9 was inhibited significantly by both crude and pure <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi> (by 56 and 54.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
