<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome wide analysis studies have identified sequence mutations causing loss-of-function that are associated with disease occurrence and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic modifications, such DNA methylation, have also been implicated in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> but have yet to be examined in the East Asian population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and matched non-cancerous tissue types were obtained and genomic DNA was isolated and subjected to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> conversion method for comparative DNA methylation analysis on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Totals of 258 and 74 genes were found to be hyper- and hypo-methylated as compared to the individual's matched control tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, three genes that exhibited hypermethylation in their promoter regions, CMTM2, ECRG4, and SH3GL3, were shown to be significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using heatmap cluster analysis, eight hypermethylated and 10 hypomethylated genes were identified as significantly differentially methylated genes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide methylation profiling facilitates rapid and simultaneous analysis of cancerous cells which may help to identify methylation markers with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show the promise of the microarray technology in identification of potential methylation biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
