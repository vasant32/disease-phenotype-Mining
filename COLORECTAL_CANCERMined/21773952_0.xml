<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Two nomograms are available for predicting patient survival after hepatic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they have not been externally validated using other databases, and so their universal applicability has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine the validity of these nomograms for predicting patient survival after hepatic resection for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in different institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the cases of 113 patients who underwent hepatic resection for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at Hiroshima University Hospital between 1995 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this patient set, we assessed the predictive value of the Kattan nomogram of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center (MSKCC) (United States) and the Kanemitsu nomogram from the Aichi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center (Japan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concordance index was used as an accuracy measure for comparing these two nomograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predictive accuracy of these nomograms was compared with that of conventional predictive models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates in our cohort were 66.3%, 52.4%, and 42.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concordance indexes of the pre- and postoperative Kanemitsu nomogram and that of the Kattan nomogram were 0.70, 0.69, and 0.68, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These values were higher than those obtained using other models for hepatic metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, including the clinical risk score of the MSKCC and the grading system of the Japanese Society for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer of the Colon</z:e> and Rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high predictive accuracy of both nomograms shows that these predictive tools can be used in different institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patient counseling and adjuvant therapy decision-making should benefit from use of these nomograms </plain></SENT>
