<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Recent in vitro and animal studies have suggested that the cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> is linked to increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective study was undertaken to examine the generation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, in 106 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> combination (FOLFOX) therapy as measured by urinary excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> (8-oxoGuo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The amounts of 8-oxoGuo and 8-oxodG were measured in 3 spot urine samples from 106 patients by using ultra performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we collected information on other clinical and demographic variables hypothesized to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated measures linear mixed models were used to model the relationship between urinary concentrations of 8-oxoGuo and 8-oxodG and the treatment effect and the other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis showed that chemotherapy increased the excretion of 8-oxoGuo and 8-oxodG around 15% (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.02, respectively) though there was a significant interaction with CRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found that sex, smoking status, age, and c-reactive protein were related to urinary excretion of 8-oxoGuo and 8-oxodG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that FOLFOX induces ROS in patients and that ROS-generating mechanisms interact </plain></SENT>
