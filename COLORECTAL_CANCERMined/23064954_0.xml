<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Pazopanib plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> combination therapy was explored in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a modified 3 + 3 enrollment scheme, oral once-daily pazopanib was administered with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> (Days 1 and 8, 21-day cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three protocol-specified dose levels were tested: pazopanib 400 mg plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> 1,000 mg/m(2), pazopanib 800 mg plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> 1,000 mg/m(2), and pazopanib 800 mg plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> 1,250 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximum-tolerated dose was based on dose-limiting toxicities during treatment Cycle 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the expansion phase, six additional patients were enrolled at the highest tolerable dose level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the highest dose level tested (pazopanib 800 plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> 1,250), patients received &gt;80% of their planned dose and the regimen was deemed safe and tolerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common treatment-related adverse events included <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and decreased appetite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>Neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were the most common events leading to dose modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic interaction between pazopanib and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One objective partial response at the highest dose was observed in a patient with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prolonged disease stabilization (&gt;12 cycles) was reported in three patients (metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath>, and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combination pazopanib plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> therapy is tolerable, with an adverse event profile reflective of that associated with the individual agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction with pazopanib plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> co-administration, although patient numbers were limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of combined pazopanib plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> is warranted </plain></SENT>
