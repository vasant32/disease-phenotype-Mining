<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that gene expression levels and germline variations in CD133 will predict clinical outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC), treated in first-line setting with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and bevacizumab (BV), and we investigated whether there is a correlation with gene expression levels of CD133, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated intra-tumoral gene expression levels by quantitative real-time (RT) PCR from 54 patients and three germline variants of the CD133 gene by PCR-restriction-fragment length polymorphism from 91 patients with genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High gene expression levels of CD133 (&gt;7.76) conferred a significantly greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response (RR=86%) than patients with low expression levels (î‹º7.76, RR=38%, adjusted P=0.003), independent of VEGF or its receptor gene expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression levels of CD133 were significantly associated with VEGF and its receptors <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> levels (VEGFR-1 (P&lt;0.01), -2 and -3, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined analyses of two polymorphisms showed a significant association with progression-free survival (PFS) (18.5 months vs 9.8 months, P=0.004) in a multivariate analysis as an independent prognostic factor for PFS (adjusted P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CD133 is a predictive marker for standard first-line BV-based treatment in mCRC </plain></SENT>
