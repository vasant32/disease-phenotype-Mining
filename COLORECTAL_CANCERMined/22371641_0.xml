<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To access the short-term outcomes of simultaneous laparoscopic surgery combined with resection for synchronous lesions in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 1996 and April 2010 prospectively collected data were reviewed from 93 consecutive patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and underwent simultaneous multiple organ resection (combined group) and 1090 patients who underwent conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy or laparoscopic low/anterior resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (non-combined group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the combined group, there were nine gastric resections, three nephrectomies, nine adrenalectomies, 56 cholecystectomies, and 21 gynecologic resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, five patients underwent simultaneous laparoscopic resection for three organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient demographics, intra-operative outcomes, surgical morbidity, and short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups (the combined and non-combined groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the clinicopathological variables between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operating time was significantly longer in the combined group than in the non-combined group, regardless of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and laparoscopic low/anterior resection groups; P = 0.048 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other intra-operative outcomes, such as the complications and open conversion rate, were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of post-operative morbidity in the combined group was similar to the non-combined group (combined vs non-combined, 15.1% vs 13.5%, P = 0.667) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oncological safety for the colon and synchronous lesions were obtained in the combined group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Simultaneous laparoscopic multiple organ resection combined with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is a safe and feasible option in selected patients </plain></SENT>
