<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There is a lack of study concerning expression of Topoisomerase IIα (Topo IIα) and long-term results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the relationship between expression of Topo IIα and clinicopathological parameters including overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin-fixed specimens from a large prospective cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who had been followed up for 4 years were assayed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 490 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients accessible for Topo IIα expression, expression of Topo IIα was scored as (-) in 4 (0.8%) patients, (+) in 41 (8.4%) patients, (++) in 396 (80.8%) patients, and (+++) in 49 (10.0%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Topo IIα was found to be related with lower T stage (p = 0.042), lower N stage (p = 0.038), and a lower incidence of recurrence with nearly significance (p = 0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that overexpression of Topo IIα was related with prolonged overall survival (p = 0.022) and disease-free survival (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses showed that elevated serum CEA (p &lt; 0.001), elevated serum CA199 (p = 0.002), poor differentiation (p = 0.001), advanced Dukes stage (p &lt; 0.001), and lower expression of Topo IIα (p = 0.017) were independent predictive factors for poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Topo IIα expression is a valuable prognostic indicator for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and would be useful in treatment selection for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and malignant colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> resected under endoscopy, especially when it is used in combination with serum CEA, CA199, and differentiation </plain></SENT>
