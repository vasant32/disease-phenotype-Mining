<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we show up-regulation of the S100A6 protein level in non-metastatic SW480 cells due to overexpression of β-catenin as well as the activation of the S100A6 gene promoter upon cell transfection with β-catenin and the TCF-Lef1 transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since we found a high level of S100A6 in metastatic SW620 cells we searched for its interacting partners in the protein extract prepared from these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using several methods we found that S100A6 interacts with lamin A/C, a protein known to be implicated in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal a novel and important network of relations and interactions between proteins potentially involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development and progression </plain></SENT>
