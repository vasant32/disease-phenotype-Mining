<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab and cetuximab in the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> presenting with initially unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of the Kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene homolog (K-ras) <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, from the perspective of German statutory health insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The health-economic modeling approach presented here made indirect comparisons between available data on bevacizumab and cetuximab treatment outcomes using evidence synthesis techniques, extrapolating from the follow-up duration of identified clinical trials to a longer time horizon of up to 10 years and inferring costs and health outcomes based on modeled patient pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expert opinion and Delphi panel methods were used for some assumptions, when evidence was missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and different scenario analyses were applied to test for uncertainty around input parameters and assumptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> LLD population with K-ras <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype, mean overall survival estimates were 37.7 months for first-line treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI (irinotecan, leucovorin, fluorouracil) and 30.4 months for bevacizumab plus FOLFOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, leucovorin, fluorouracil) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding discounted survival estimates were 2.88 life-years with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus 2.38 life-years with bevacizumab plus FOLFOX, an average gain of 0.50 discounted life-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus bevacizumab plus FOLFOX was €15,020 (year 2010 €) per life-year gained in the base case (with a 95% CI from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis of €3806-€24,660) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were robust in different scenario analyses as well as in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: First-line treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI offers a cost-effective treatment option versus bevacizumab plus FOLFOX for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> LLD population with K-ras <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>K-ras testing should be performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presenting cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> to ensure access to this treatment option </plain></SENT>
