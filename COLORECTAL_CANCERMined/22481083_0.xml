<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Critical to successful execution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is apoptosome formation and subsequent activation of caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defects in this pathway have an important role in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and chemoresistance; therefore, the expression of apoptosome-associated proteins may be associated with clinical outcome and response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here we performed a systematic analysis of the immunohistochemical expression of the key proteins involved in apoptosome-dependent caspase activation (APAF1, Pro-caspases 9 and 3, SMAC, and XIAP) in a cohort of Stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients from a Phase III trial of adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy vs postoperative observation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survival analysis indicated that of the apoptosome-associated proteins examined here, Pro-caspase 3 and APAF1 have potential clinical utility as predictive markers in Stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we identified APAF1 staining to be associated with better recurrence-free and overall survival in patients receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These studies reveal the importance of the apoptosome-dependent caspase activation pathway, specifically Pro-caspase 3 and APAF1 proteins, for predicting both prognosis and response to therapy </plain></SENT>
