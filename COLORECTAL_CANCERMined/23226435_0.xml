<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> molecules that regulate the expression of corresponding <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variations in the level of expression of distinct miRNAs have been observed in the genesis, progression and prognosis of multiple human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed to investigate the association between four highly studied miRNA polymorphisms (mir-146a rs2910164, mir-196a2 rs11614913, mir-149 rs2292832 and mir-499 rs3746444) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk by using a two-sided meta-analytic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An updated meta-analysis based on 53 independent case-control studies consisting of 27573 cancer cases and 34791 controls was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to investigate the strength of the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the pooled analysis showed that mir-196a2 rs11614913 was associated with a decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk (OR = 0.846, P = 0.004, TT vs. CC) while other miRNA SNPs showed no association with overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses based on type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and ethnicity were also performed, and results indicated that there was a strong association between miR-146a rs2910164 and overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in Caucasian population under recessive model (OR = 1.274, 95%CI = 1.096-1.481, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type also associated mir-196a2 rs11614913 with lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at allelic and genotypic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis suggests an important role of mir-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism with overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk especially in Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies with large sample size are needed to evaluate and confirm this association </plain></SENT>
