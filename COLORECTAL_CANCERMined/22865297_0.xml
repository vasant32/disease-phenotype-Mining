<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the HM Jack (Jack) (Kiowa, Japan), with the OC-Hemodia (OC) (Eiken, Japan) in use in the Florence screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aims of the study were: (i) to investigate the diagnostic performance and the best cutoff value for Jack; (ii) to evaluate the handiness of sampling tubes; (iii) to compare costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 5,044 subjects were screened with both tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sampling tube investigation was performed running each sample on both instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of 352 subjects positive for at least one test (175 OC, 310 Jack) were selected for further investigations, while 46 subjects refused further assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of costs related to the assessment phase was performed on the basis of Tuscany region's fares </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Amongst the 306 subjects investigated, 9 CRC and 67 advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (AdA) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detection rates (DR) were 1.4‰ for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 9.6‰ for AdA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After Jack cutoff optimization, DR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>+AdA resulted in 11.1‰ for OC and 13.3‰ for Jack (p=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of the methods was 73.7 for OC and 88.2 for Jack; specificity was 97.6 for OC and 96.0 for Jack, resulting in an increase of the required assessments from 3.5% to 5.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between sampling methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the lower specificity of Jack, its greater sensitivity makes the method attractive for screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An increase of the costs of 30% for every subject investigated for pathological lesion (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>+AdA) may be thus foreseen </plain></SENT>
