<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CIN is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> phenomenon, which may be studied not only by employing LOH analysis but also by observing chromosomal imbalances (gains and deletions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between CIMP and chromosomal gains and deletions (assessed by comparative genomic hybridization) in a group of 20 CIMP-high and 79 CIMP-low/CIMP-0 CRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that the mean numbers of gains and of total chromosomal imbalances were significantly greater (p = 0.004 and p = 0.007, respectively) in the CIMP-low/CIMP-0 group compared to the CIMP-high group, while no significant difference was observed between the mean numbers of losses (p = 0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of copy number changes of 41 cancer-related genes by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification showed that CRK gene was exclusively deleted in CIMP-low/CIMP-0 tumors (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given that chromosomal losses play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor inactivation and chromosomal gains, in the activation of proto-oncogenes, we hypothesize that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor inactivation plays similar roles in both CIMP-high and CIMP-low/CIMP-0 CRCs, while the predominance of chromosomal gains in CIMP-low/CIMP-0 tumors may suggest that the activation of proto-oncogenes is the underlying mechanism of CIMP-low/CIMP-0 CRC progression </plain></SENT>
