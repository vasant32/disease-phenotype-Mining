<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue and has a variety of functions including the inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression and function of the two major adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, in malignant tissue have not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression in 48 surgically resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa, by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The values obtained were standardized by β-actin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and the correlation between their relative expression levels and the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative expression levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were significantly reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue (AdipoR1: 0.97±0.39 vs. 1.37��0.41, P&lt;0.0001; AdipoR2: 0.92±0.31 vs. 1.60±0.46, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 levels were further reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and the difference was statistically significant in the case of AdipoR2 (0.79±0.27 vs. 1.02±0.30, P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrated that the expression levels of adiponectin receptors are reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, indicating a downregulation in the course of the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since adiponectin is abundantly present in the whole body and has inhibitory effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, this downregulation of the receptors may be an escape mechanism of malignant cells from the suppressive effects of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
