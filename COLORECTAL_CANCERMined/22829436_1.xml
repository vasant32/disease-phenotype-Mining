<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-stabilized perfluorobutane microbubbles as an ultrasound contrast agent may improve this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The value of contrast-enhanced IOUS (CE-IOUS) in enumerating colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> was studied here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CE-IOUS was performed in consecutive resections for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in 2007-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent preoperative computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was not carried out routinely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conventional intraoperative examination including IOUS, and CE-IOUS with peripherally injected contrast were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histopathological findings and 6-month follow-up images were used as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study group of 102 patients had a total of 315 lesions identified on preoperative imaging (2·4 lesions per operation; 129 operations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conventional intraoperative examination including IOUS identified 350 lesions (2·7 per operation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CE-IOUS identified 370 lesions (2·9 per operation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CE-IOUS were 97·1, 59·1 and 93·2 per cent respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The CE-IOUS findings altered the surgical plan in 19 operations (14·7 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CE-IOUS provided additional information to that obtained using contemporary preoperative imaging and conventional intraoperative examinations </plain></SENT>
