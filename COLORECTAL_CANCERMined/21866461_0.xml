<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> cells line HCT-8 and HT29 were cultured in vitro and treated with different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>(10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, 35 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of proliferation was tested by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> on the cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle of HCT-8 and HT29 were detected with flow cytometry, and gene expression of HCT-8 and HT29 after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> treatment with real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> affected the proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of HCT-8 and HT29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inhibition rates of the three different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> were(28.894±5.076)%, (34.903±1.794)%, and (39.028±0.105)% on HCT-8, and (14.682±4.244)%, (22.429±3.847)%, and (29.840±5.076)% on HT29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> caused G(2)/M phase arrest and M phase transition in HCT-8 cell line, and S phase arrest and G2 phase transition in HT29 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> down-regulated HES1 gene expression in both cell lines, however, the differences were not statistically significant(both P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> upregulated JAG1 gene expression in both cell lines, however only the difference in HCT-8 was statistically significant(0.201±0.018 vs. 0.440±0.077, P=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> can significantly inhibit the proliferation of HT29 cells and HCT-8 cells by changing cell cycle and inducing cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism may be related to the upregulation of JAG1 gene expression </plain></SENT>
