<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, much evidence has suggested that bevacizumab-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> might be predictive of the effect of bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to retrospectively assess the relationship between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and the activity of bevacizumab in Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between July 2007 and December 2010, 36 patients (median age 66 years; 36-81 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were assigned to receive bevacizumab in combination with either mFOLFOX6 (5-FU, levofolinate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) or FOLFIRI (5-FU, levofolinate and irinotecan) at the Tokushima University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A patient who had increase by &gt;20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure or had increase to &gt;150/100 mmHg or received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment was defined as hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between the hypertensive group (n=10) and non-hypertensive group (n=26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ORR and DCR were 60.0% and 100%, respectively, in the hypertensive group and ORR and DCR were 23.1% and 80.8%, respectively, in the non-hypertensive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median PFS tended to be longer in the hypertensive group (65.0 weeks) than in the non-hypertensive group (40.0 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggested that bevacizumab-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be predictive of the effect of bevacizumab in Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
