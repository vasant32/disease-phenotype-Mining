<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying genetic features of this disorder could improve management, and especially surveillance, of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018552" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hamartomatous</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> associated mutations in the susceptibility genes PTEN,BMPR1A, SMAD4, ENG, andSTK11 in individuals with 5 or more gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, including at least 1 hamartomatous or hyperplastic/serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a prospective, referral-based study of 603 patients (median age 51 y; range, 2-89 y), enrolled from June 2006 through January 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes and analyzed for specific mutations and large rearrangements in PTEN,BMPR1A,SMAD4, and STK11, as well as mutations in ENG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recursive partitioning analysis was used to determine cutoffs for continuous variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of mutations was compared using Fischer's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were used to determine univariate and multivariate risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 603 patients, 119 (20%) had a personal history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and most (461; 76%) had fewer than 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients (13%) were found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e>-associated mutations, comprising 11 inENG (1.8%), 13 inPTEN (2.2%), 13 inSTK11 (2.2%), 20 inBMPR1A (3.3%), and 21 inSMAD4 (3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Univariate clinical predictors for risk of having these mutations included age at presentation less than 40 years (19% vs 10%;P =.008), a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> burden of 30 or more (19% vs 11%;P =0.014), and male sex (16% vs 10%;P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who had 1 or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003005'>ganglioneuromas</z:hpo> (29% vs 2%;P &lt;.001) or presented with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of 3 or more histologic types (20% vs 2%;P =.003) were more likely to have germline mutations inPTEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age less than 40 years, male sex, and specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> histologies are significantly associated with risk of germline mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018552" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hamartomatous</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> associated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These associations could guide clinical decision making and further investigations </plain></SENT>
