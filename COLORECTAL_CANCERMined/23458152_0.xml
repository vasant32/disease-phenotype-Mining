<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is controversy regarding the morbidity associated with simultaneous, compared with separate or staged, resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for 2005-2008 from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) were used to compare morbidity after 19â€‰925 colorectal procedures for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (CR group), 2295 hepatic resections for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="48293">HEP</z:chebi> group), and 314 simultaneous colorectal and hepatic resections (SIM group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increasing number of simultaneous resections were performed per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fewer major colorectal and liver resections were performed in the SIM than in the CR and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48293">HEP</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the SIM group had a longer operative time and postoperative length of stay compared with those in either the CR or <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48293">HEP</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous procedures resulted in higher rates of postoperative morbidity and major morbidity than CR procedures, but not <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48293">HEP</z:chebi> procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference was driven by higher rates of wound and organ space <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and a greater incidence of septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates did not differ among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals in the NSQIP are performing more simultaneous colonic and hepatic resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These procedures are associated with increases in operative time, length of stay and rate of perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous procedures do not, however, increase perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
