<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About one-fourth of empirically defined human promoters are surrounded by or contain clustered repetitive elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was previously observed that a sharp transition of methylation exists between highly methylated repetitive elements and unmethylated promoter-CGIs in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The factors that lead to aberrant CGI hypermethylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we established a site-specific integration system with enforced local transcriptional repression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and monitored the occurrence of initial de novo methylation at specific CG sites adjacent to the CGI of the INSL6 promoter, which could be accelerated by binding a KRAB-containing transcriptional factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional repetitive elements from P16 and RIL (PDLIM4), if situated adjacent to the promoter of INSL6, could confer DNA methylation spreading into the CGI particularly in the setting of KRAB-factor binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a repressive chromatin alone was not sufficient to initiate DNA methylation, which required specific DNA sequences and was integration-site (and/or cell-line) specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results demonstrate a requirement for specific DNA sequences to trigger de novo DNA methylation, and repetitive elements as cis-regulatory factors to cooperate with advanced transcriptional repression in promoting methylation spreading </plain></SENT>
