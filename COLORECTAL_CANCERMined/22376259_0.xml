<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed comprehensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analyses of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the COX-2 gene and examined its susceptibility to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> development in 72 African American cases and 142 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results revealed significant variation in LD patterns with consequence for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two distinct haplotype blocks were identified; one block covered the coding regions of exon 1, introns and a section of the 3'-unstranslated region (3'-UTR), whereas the second block resided solely in the 3'-UTR region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A haplotype in block 1 increased the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> development by threefold (odds ratio [OR]= 2.9, confidence interval [CI]= 1.8-3.7, P= 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis showed, increase in copies of minor alleles of 6,064(T&gt;C) polymorphism associated with increased odds of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> development by 80% (OR = 1.80, CI = 1.09-3.21, P= 0.034), 10,848(G&gt;A) by 84% (OR = 1.84, CI = 1.05-3.23, P= 0.034) and 10,935(A&gt;G) by 32% (OR = 1.32, CI = 1.12-3.69, P= 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that COX-2 gene might play a role in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and warrant further investigation in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides, these variations should be taken into account for disease-based association studies in which the COX-2 polymorphism is considered as a candidate gene </plain></SENT>
