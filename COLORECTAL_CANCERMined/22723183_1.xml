<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Effective colonoscopy depends on adequate visualization of the intestine, which might be ensured by intraprocedural use of a cleansing device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the performance of a novel endoscopic device with regard to cleanliness, safety, and tolerability during colonoscopy, compared with standard cleansing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: At a single center, colonoscopy patients in whom the cecum was accessed and at least one bowel segment was inadequately cleansed were assigned to either use of a disposable catheter cleansing device (JetPrep), used through the endoscope working channel, or standard manual cleansing using a 50-ml syringe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cleansing quality, for each segment and before and after irrigation, was recorded using a 4-point scale ranging from excellent (grade 1, no more than small bits of adherent feces) to poor (grade 4, large amount of fecal residue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 38 patients were included, 19 in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reasons for referral included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (52 %), or blood loss (31 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each segment showed improvement after cleansing with JetPrep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall cleansing grade improved by a mean of 0.74 points (standard deviation [SD] 0.82) in the investigation group compared with 0.19 (0.40) in the control group (P &lt; 0.0001), and right colon cleansing improved by 1.59 points (0.71) versus 0.31 (0.48) in the controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in procedure time between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No adverse events or side effects were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The JetPrep disposable catheter device is safe and efficient for intraprocedural cleansing of a suboptimally prepared colon, allowing higher quality colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
