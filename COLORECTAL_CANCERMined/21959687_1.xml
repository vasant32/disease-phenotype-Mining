<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and treatment gives the patient a chance for complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Screening colonoscopies in the symptom-free patients are currently performed on a wide scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The examinations are performed under local anesthesia which does not eliminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> discomfort and pain related to the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate magnetic scope navigation in screening endoscopic examinations performed to detect early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 200 patients, aged 40-65 years, who were free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent complete colonoscopy under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The equipment could be fitted with the scope that allows three-dimensional observation of instrument localization in the bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The examination was performed by three experienced endoscopists, each of whom performed over 5,000 colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomized to two groups: those whose equipment did not have 3D navigation (group I) and those whose equipment did have 3D navigation (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each group consisted of 100 cases matched by gender, age, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors compared the duration of introducing instrument to cecum, the pulse rate before the examination and at the time the instrument reached the cecum, and subjective pain evaluation by the patient on the visual analog scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group I consisted of 54 women and 46 men with a mean age of 54.6 years and mean BMI of 27.8 kg/m(2), and group II had 58 women and 42 men, mean age of 55.1 years and mean BMI of 26.4 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The average time it took for the instrument to reach the cecum was 216s in group I and 181s in group II (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pain measured on the 10-point VAS scale was 2.44 in group I and 1.85 in group II (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results showed a significantly shorter time for the instrument to reach the cecum in group II and significantly lower pain intensity during the examination was reported by the group II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the pulse measurements between the groups (P = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 3D navigation during colonoscopy decreases the time for the instrument to reach the cecum and lowers pain intensity subjectively reported by the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The use of 3D and the possibility to observe instrument localization and maneuvers brings more comfort to the patients </plain></SENT>
