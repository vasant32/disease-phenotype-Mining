<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ARIES study enrolled patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) receiving first-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab and followed them longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protocol did not specify treatment regimens or assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who initiated bevacizumab in combination with either first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> with infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan with infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjusting for potential confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1,550 patients with first-line mCRC were enrolled (median follow-up, 21 months) and most received FOLFOX-bevacizumab (n = 968) or FOLFIRI-bevacizumab (n = 243) as first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The baseline characteristics and median treatment duration were generally similar between subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the median PFS (10.3 months vs. 10.2 months) or OS (23.7 months vs. 25.5 months) time between the FOLFOX-bevacizumab and FOLFIRI-bevacizumab subgroups, respectively, by unadjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses showed FOLFIRI-bevacizumab resulted in a similar PFS (HR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.21) and OS (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.16) outcome as with FOLFOX-bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence proportions of bevacizumab-associated adverse events were similar for FOLFOX- and FOLFIRI-based therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In first-line mCRC patients, the FOLFOX-bevacizumab and FOLFIRI-bevacizumab regimens were associated with similar treatment patterns and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
