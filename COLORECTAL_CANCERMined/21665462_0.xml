<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Second-line treatment with irinotecan for advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> prolongs survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is uncertain whether irinotecan is better administered with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> or alone in patients previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared toxicity (particularly diarrhoea), quality of life, and efficacy of combination chemotherapy and irinotecan in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In DaVINCI, a randomised phase II trial, patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomly allocated to: Combination therapy (FOLFIRI), irinotecan (180 mg/m(2) IV over 90 min, day 1), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (400mg/m(2) IV bolus and 2400 mg/m(2) by 46-hour infusion from day 1) and folinic acid (20mg/m(2) IV bolus, day 1), 2-weekly; or Single-agent, irinotecan (350 mg/m(2) IV over 90 min), 3-weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was evaluated every treatment cycle; QOL and response 6-weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trial, amended from a larger factorial design, was terminated early due to slow recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were also combined with other second-line irinotecan trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We randomised 44 patients to combination and 45 to single agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients in the irinotecan arm and 4 in the combination arm had grade 3/4 diarrhoea (P=0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment groups did not differ significantly in overall QOL changes, response rate or progression free or overall-survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a systematic review of 29 trials of second-line irinotecan-based treatment, single-agent irinotecan was associated with more diarrhoea and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> than the combination but efficacy was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Combination treatment compared with single-agent irinotecan reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> and diarrhoea without compromising efficacy on clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both regimens remain as reasonable treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>FUNDING: Research grant (Pfizer) </plain></SENT>
