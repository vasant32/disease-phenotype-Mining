<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies of body mass index (BMI) and waist size are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, independently of the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> phenotype due to a shared etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 15 loci (BDNF, FAIM2, FTO, GNPDA2, KCTD15, LYPLAL1, MC4R, MSRA, MTCH2, NEGR1, NRXN3, SEC16B, SH2B1, TFAP2B and TMEM18) were genotyped in a case-control study of 2,033 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 9,640 controls nested within the multiethnic cohort study, as part of the population architecture using genomics and epidemiology consortium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk alleles for two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> SNPs were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk--KCTD15 rs29941 [odds ratio (OR) for C allele = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.98; p = 0.01] and MC4R rs17782313 (OR for C allele = 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of the effect of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, none of the results remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was observed across race/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> risk variants are not likely to affect the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> substantially </plain></SENT>
