<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> plays an important role in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have indicated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the predominant angiogenic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 (CCND1) induces production of VEGF and is required for migration of blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the roles of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed clinicopathological features, VEGF and CCND1 expressions by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in 100 stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (44 were postoperative relapsed; 56 were postoperative non-relapsed) to determine the correlation between clinicopathologic features and co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the clinical outcomes of co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed vascular invasion (P = 0.019), VEGF overexpression (P = 0.033), and high postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (P = 0.022) were independent predictors of postoperative relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression had significantly poorer disease-free survival rates (P â€‰= 0.004) and overall survival rates (P = 0.001) than <z:mp ids='MP_0005395'>other phenotypes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression would potentially assist in TNM staging systems to predict the prognosis of these patients who would benefit from intensive follow-up and therapeutic programs </plain></SENT>
