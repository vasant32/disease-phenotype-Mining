<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important prerequisite is the coverage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size is the most important limiting factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: The drawbacks of conventional computed tomography/ultrasound/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/US/MRI) guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are the absence of planning software, imprecise probe placement, imprecise control of probe placement and the ablation zone as well as the lack of reliability and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS: Stereotactic and robot-assisted systems allow planning of multiple probe positions based on CT/MRI and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) planning data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probes can be precisely placed according to the coordinates of the image datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PERFORMANCE: The 1 and 3 year survival rates after stereotactic RFA (SRFA) of cholangiocellular <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were 91% and 70% respectively and the median overall survival was 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After SRFA of 189 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in 63 patients there was no significant difference in local recurrence rates between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> &lt; 3 cm (17.7%), 3-5 cm (11.1%) and &gt; 5 cm (17.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 33.2 months and the 1, 3, and 5 year overall survival rates after SRFA in patients with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were 92%, 66% and 48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ACHIEVEMENTS: In our opinion the excellent and, to a large extent user-independent results justify the increased efforts in time and costs especially for the treatment of patients with large and irregular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Stereotaxy and robotics are valuable tools for effective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> ablation especially of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and are likely to gain in importance in the next few years </plain></SENT>
