<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When compared to surgical and final pathohistological (PH) findings, MREUS shows that it can differentiate colon layers in great detail and therefore we can determine the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> dissemination (T1, T2, T3, T4) as well as to make a correct therapeutic choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MREUS (12-15-20 MHz) is a highly reliable colon layer structural analysis method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As we have shown in our study, the accuracy of T stage colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> visualization in correlation to equivalent PH studies varies from 90-100% which makes MREUS the best as well as the most reliable method in determining preoperative T stage colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
