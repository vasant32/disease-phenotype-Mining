<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consistent efforts were called for to identify molecular markers that can effectively predict patients' response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> transporters, particularly human equilibrative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> transporter 1 (hENT1), in predicting clinical treatment outcome with 5FU-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of a panel of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> transporters in biopsied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from 7 CRC patients was measured by real-time PCR prior to 5FU-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To provide mechanistic support for the role of hENT1 in 5FU resistance, cell viability of Caco-2 cells was measured, following incubation with varying concentrations of 5FU and a hENT1 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were further subjected to global metabonomic profiling using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High hENT1 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue correlated with poor clinical response to 5FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corroborating with the clinical findings, chemical inhibition of hENT1 in Caco-2 cells resulted in an augmentation of 5FU efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metabonomic profiling revealed that the pretreatment metabotype associated with non-responders to 5FU therapy was distinct from metabotype of responders (partial least-squares discriminant analysis Q(2) (cumulative) = 0.898, R(2)X = 0.513, R(2)Y = 0.996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first clinical report on the relationships of intratumoral expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> transporters and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> metabotype with response to 5FU among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coupled to the in vitro findings, our preliminary data suggested hENT1 to be a potential codeterminant of clinical response to 5FU </plain></SENT>
