<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: DEBIRI, loaded with 100 mg irinotecan (100-300 μm beads), was administered via hepatic artery during the off week of FOLFOX therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were safety, tolerance, systemic dose-limiting toxicities, and pharmacokinetics of systemic irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 at each infusion at 1-, 4-, and 24-h post-DEBIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were response rate and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ten patients have undergone at least 12 cycles of FOLFOX in combination with at least two DEBIRI bead treatments during the patients' off week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated minimal detectable levels of irinotecan (18.6, 21, and 18.6 ng/ml) and SN-38 (1.06, 1.47, and 1.55 ng/ml) after the first, second, and third DEBIRI treatments, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Currently, there has been only one severe device-related adverse event, a grade 3 hypertensive episode that required 1 day of observation in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial 9- and 12-month response rates have been 100 % (2 CR, 8 PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four (40 %) patients were successfully downstaged to resection and/or ablation with a median overall survival of 15.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Concomitant DEBIRI and FOLFOX±bevacizumab is safe, with a minimal adverse event rate, no dose-limiting toxicities, and enhanced overall response rate </plain></SENT>
