<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients undergoing curatively intended surgery subsequently develop recurrence and die from the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and appear to have both diagnostic and prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified novel miRNAs associated with recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and their possible mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TaqMan(®) Human MicroRNA Array Set v2.0 was used to profile the expression of 667 miRNAs in 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosas and 46 microsatellite stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four miRNAs (miR-362-3p, miR-570, miR-148 a* and miR-944) were expressed at a higher level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from patients with no recurrence (p&lt;0.015), compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from patients with recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant association with increased disease free survival was confirmed for miR-362-3p in a second independent cohort of 43 CRC patients, using single TaqMan(®) microRNA assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro functional analysis showed that over-expression of miR-362-3p in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines reduced cell viability, and proliferation mainly due to cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E2F1, USF2 and PTPN1 were identified as potential miR-362-3p targets by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> profiling of HCT116 cells over-expressing miR-362-3p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, these genes were confirmed as direct targets by Luciferase reporter assays and their knockdown in vitro phenocopied the effects of miR-362-3p over-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that miR-362-3p may be a novel prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and hypothesize that the positive effects of augmented miR-362-3p expression may in part be mediated through the targets E2F1, USF2 and PTPN1 </plain></SENT>
