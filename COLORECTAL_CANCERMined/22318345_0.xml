<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the difficulty in diagnosis, prognosis of GC is very poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify genetic determinants of GC, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 41 GC patients and 866 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Association between each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with GC susceptibility was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis conditioned on age and gender of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNPs that showed suggestive association (P&lt;1 × 10(-4)) with GC were further examined in 30 cases and 898 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNP rs7504990 in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> (deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 18q21.3) that encodes a netrin 1 receptor achieved a combined P-value of 7.46 × 10(-8) (OR=6.95; 95% CI=3.43-14.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent imputation analysis identified multiple SNPs with similarly strong associations in an adjacent genomic region, where loss of heterozygosity was reported in GC and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> was indicated to be associated with the poorly differentiated histological type, increased proliferation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> through loss of adhesiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, due to the limited sample size investigated here, further replication study and functional analysis would be necessary to further confirm the result of the association </plain></SENT>
