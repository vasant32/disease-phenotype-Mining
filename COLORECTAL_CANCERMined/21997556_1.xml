<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the authors aim to uncover subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> that have distinct biological characteristics associated with prognosis and identify potential biomarkers that best reflect the biological and clinical characteristics of subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was applied to gene expression data from 177 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to determine a prognostic gene expression signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Validation of the signature was sought in two independent patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between the signature and prognosis of patients was assessed by Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank tests and the Cox model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors identified a gene signature that was associated with overall survival and disease-free survival in 177 patients and validated in two independent cohorts of 213 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the signature was an independent risk factor (HR 3.08; 95% CI 1.33 to 7.14; p=0.008 for overall survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subset analysis of patients with AJCC (American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>) stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> revealed that the signature can also identify the patients who have better outcome with adjuvant chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly affected disease-free survival in patients in subtype B (3-year rate, 71.2% (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) vs 41.9% (no <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>); p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, such benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was not significant for patients in subtype A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The gene signature is an independent predictor of response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
