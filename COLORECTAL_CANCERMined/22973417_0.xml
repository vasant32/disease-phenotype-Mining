<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the most recent classes of targeted therapies being developed are inhibitors targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As one of the most frequently deregulated pathways in several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, aberrant PI3K signaling plays an important role in the growth, survival, motility and metabolism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Targeting this pathway therefore has considerable potential to lead to novel and more effective treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preclinical and early clinical studies have revealed the potential efficacy of drugs that target PI3K signaling for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a major challenge that remains is to study these agents in phase III clinical trials to see whether these early successes translate into better patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review we focus on providing an up-to-date assessment of our current understanding of PI3K signaling biology and its deregulation in the molecular pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
