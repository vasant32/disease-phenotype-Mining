<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Population-based study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 70+ year-olds in a Danish province diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity was measured according to Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of comorbidity in newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients was compared with a control group by conditional logistic regression, and influence of comorbidity on mortality was analysed by Cox proportional hazards method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6325 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elderly lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients had significantly more comorbidity than the background population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe comorbidity was associated with higher overall mortality in the lung, colorectal, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> patients, hazard ratios 1.51 (95% CI 1.24-1.83), 1.41 (95% CI 1.14-1.73), and 2.14 (95% CI 1.65-2.77), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity did not affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific mortality in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> was associated with increased comorbidity burden in the elderly compared with the background population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity was associated with increased overall mortality in elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients but not consistently with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific mortality </plain></SENT>
