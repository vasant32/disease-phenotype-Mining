<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> results in the up-regulated expression of a novel member of the cadherin protein superfamily, named μ-protocadherin, which is able to sequester β-catenin on plasmatic membrane of treated cells inhibiting its proliferation signalling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that μ-protocadherin could exert an oncosuppressive effect on colorectal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to assess whether μ-protocadherin expression is down-regulated during colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This issue was addressed by analyzing the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of μ-protocadherin in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> colorectal cell samples using a combination of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, microarray analysis, and immunohistochemical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To better contextualize the role played by μ-protocadherin in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, this last assay was also extended to β-catenin, E-cadherin, and Ki-67 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results obtained evidenced that (1) levels of μ-protocadherin transcript were down-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the analyzed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa; (2) expression of μ-protocadherin protein was completely lost in most analyzed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples (71%); (3) μ-protocadherin retains β-catenin on the plasmatic membrane of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon enterocytes, which implies that β-catenin is released from this site and translocated to the nucleus in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data consequently suggest that down-regulation of μ-protocadherin expression is a common event in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and might therefore play an important role in this pathologic process </plain></SENT>
