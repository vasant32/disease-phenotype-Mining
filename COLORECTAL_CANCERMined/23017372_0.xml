<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi>) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is challenging, with no clear guidance for management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study whether certain patient and disease based factors can be used to give guidance about further investigation, treatment and outcome of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data was collected via a 2-year retrospective case-note review of patients discussed at the multi-disciplinary meeting with a confirmed diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further studies were identified by a Pubmed search with no limitations and a review of references within those papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pooled analysis was performed where the data was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the two year period, 539 new cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were discussed locally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 28 (5.2%) were found to have <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignancy</z:e> was more likely when multiple nodules were detected at presentation (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pooled analysis of a further 7 studies was performed where data was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This confirmed the significance of multiple nodules in terms of predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (p&lt;0.01) and additionally demonstrated the significance of nodal disease (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the difficulties of determining the nature of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> using either patient or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant factors appear to be the presence of multiple nodules and nodal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In such cases we recommend further imaging at time of detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If absent, we recommend an interval CT scan at six months </plain></SENT>
