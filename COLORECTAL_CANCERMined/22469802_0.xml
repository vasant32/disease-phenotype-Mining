<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High iron levels can increase the formation of noxious oxygen radicals, which are thought to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether iron biomarkers and HFE genotypes, which influence iron regulation, constitute risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a prospective nested case-referent study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: The study was performed within the population-based Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The study included 226 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 437 matched referents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Conditional regression analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustments for smoking, smoking and BMI, and HFE C282Y and H63D were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest quintile of total iron-binding capacity showed significantly higher risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, unadjusted OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.38-4.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When stratified by sex, the findings were only present in women (OR 3.34 (95% CI 1.59-7.02)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ferritin was associated with reduced risk throughout quintiles 2 to 5 both in univariate and multivariate models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> may influence iron markers because of occult <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Homozygotes for HFE C282Y were too few to make conclusions for this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The relatively short follow-up time might be insufficient to detect risk of iron biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High iron levels do not increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>HFE genotypes influencing iron uptake had no effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
