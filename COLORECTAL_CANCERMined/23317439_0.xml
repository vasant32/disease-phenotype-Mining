<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study analyzed data from 100 consecutive laparoscopic surgeries for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 2009 and July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The learning curve was compared between the first 50 surgeries (study group 1) and the subsequent 50 surgeries (study group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, gender, mean body mass index, history of abdominal surgery, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage were not significantly different between the two study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operative time decreased with increasing experience and reached a plateau after 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operative time in study group 2 tended to be shorter than in study group 1 (P=.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other parameters including blood loss, average number of retrieved lymph nodes, conversion rate, and intraoperative complication rates were not different between the two study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: More junior surgeons can be safely trained if they are exposed to a focused training program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Supervision by an experienced surgeon and considerable experiences in open colorectal surgery are assets for an accelerated learning curve </plain></SENT>
