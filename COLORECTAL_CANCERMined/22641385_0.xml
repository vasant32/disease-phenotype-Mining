<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biallelic germline mutations of the MUTYH gene are known to cause multiple colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, mostly due to G:C➝T:A transversions in proto-oncogenes or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possible role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we examined alterations of the MUTYH gene including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> and allelic loss in 101 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, together with the KRAS mutation in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MUTYH mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> DNA were detected in 3 cases, while mutations were also found in DNA samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were germline mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss at the MUTYH locus was found in 10 of 51 (20.0%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and KRAS mutations were found in 33 of the 101 (32.7%) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the rate of G:C➝T:A transversion in KRAS between cases with allelic loss (1 of 10, 10.0%) and without allelic loss (9 of 41, 22.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigation of quantitative allelic imbalance at SNP rs3219489 of MUTYH showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases with C allele dominance (minor type corresponding to His) were more frequently detected with G:C➝T:A transversions than in those with G allele dominance (major type corresponding to Gln) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, somatic alterations of MUTYH in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were rare, similar to other DNA repair genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible that unknown mutations of regions not analyzed in this study and epigenetic changes of the promoter region of MUTYH may contribute to the disease </plain></SENT>
