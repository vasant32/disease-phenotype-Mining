<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimal management for this group of patients has not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The South Australian Clinical Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</z:e> (mCRC) collects data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed since February 2006 in South Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> characteristics, treatments administered, and outcomes for patients aged ≥80 years compared with patients aged &lt;80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 2314 patients were evaluable, and 29.2% of these patients were aged ≥80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority had moderately differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were reported in fewer patients aged ≥80 years (20.1% vs 26.1%; P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 28.1% of patients aged ≥80 years received chemotherapy, and 74.2% received single-agent fluoropyrimidines as first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By comparison, 68.2% of patients aged &lt;80 years received chemotherapy, 74.3% received combination chemotherapy, and 25.7% received single-agent fluoropyrimidine as first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No treatment was received by 38.2% of patients aged ≥80 years compared with 11.4% of those aged &lt;80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participation in clinical trials was lower in patients aged ≥80 years (2% vs 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survival was worse for patients aged ≥80 years (8.2 months vs 19.2 months; P &lt; .001), and the median survival of patients who received chemotherapy was 19.0 months for those aged ≥80 years and 22.3 months for those aged &lt;80 years (P = .139) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients who did not receive treatment had a poor median survival regardless of age (2.6 months for patients aged ≥80 years vs 2.7 months for patients aged &lt;80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients aged ≥80 years were less likely to receive intervention for their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and had poorer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The survival of selected patients aged ≥80 years who received chemotherapy was similar to the survival of those aged &lt;80 years despite the receipt of single-agent therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients aged ≥80 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> are less likely to receive intervention for their disease and have poorer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Survival for selected patients aged ≥80 years who receive chemotherapy is similar to the survival of patients aged &lt;80 years despite the receipt of single-agent therapy </plain></SENT>
