<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histoclinical staging is efficient, but combination with molecular markers may improve the classification of stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor genes have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and the most frequent allelic losses have been extensively studied for their prognosis effect, but the results remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we found a possible influence of the chromosome 5 status in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have here investigated the role of the APC gene, located in chromosome arm 5q, in a series of 183 <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinomas</z:mp> through a combined analysis of gene expression, mutation, allelic loss and promoter methylation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Point mutations were found in 73% of cases and allelic losses were found in 39%; 59% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> presented with a biallelic inactivation, with a very strong interdependence of the two APC hits (P = 2.1 x 10(-9)) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the determination of APC status cannot help in the prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and cannot be used to subclassify stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
