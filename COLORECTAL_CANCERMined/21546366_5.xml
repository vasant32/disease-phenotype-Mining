<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of Medicare's expansion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening test reimbursement on racial/ethnic disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was ascertained for Medicare beneficiaries (n = 30,893), aged 70 to 89, who had no history of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and resided in 16 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results regions of the United States from 1996 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests were identified in the 5% sample of Medicare claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-gender-adjusted percentages and -adjusted odds of receiving any guideline-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening [i.e., annual fecal occult blood test (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy every 5 years or colonoscopy every 10 years] by race/ethnicity and Medicare coverage expansion period (i.e., prior to FOBT coverage, FOBT coverage only, and post-colonoscopy coverage) were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening increased as Medicare coverage expanded for white and black Medicare beneficiaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, blacks were less likely than whites to receive screening prior to FOBT coverage (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.61-0.90), during FOBT coverage only (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.52-0.83) and after colonoscopy coverage (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.68-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hispanics were less likely to receive screening after colonoscopy coverage (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the expansion of Medicare coverage for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests, racial/ethnic differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening persisted over time in this universally insured population, especially for blacks and Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies should explore other factors beyond health insurance that may contribute to screening disparities in this and younger populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates increased over time, they were still low according to recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More effort is needed to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Medicare beneficiaries </plain></SENT>
