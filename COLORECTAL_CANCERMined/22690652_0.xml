<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the advantages of laparoscopic colectomy have been demonstrated, there are few data available on laparoscopic resection of transverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess operative outcomes, long-term survival, and disease recurrence after laparoscopic resection of transverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected from 58 patients with transverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> among 1141 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases undergoing laparoscopic resection between February 2001 and July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> located in both flexures were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The surgical procedures included 39 extended right hemicolectomies, 11 extended left hemicolectomies, 5 transverse colectomies, and 3 total abdominal colectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean operating time was 216 minutes, and the mean operative blood loss was 111 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average harvested lymph nodes were 35.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proximal and distal resection margins were 20.27 cm and 15.23 cm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients developed minor complications postoperatively, but these cases were controlled conservatively without interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient was converted to an open procedure because of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no surgery-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 40.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no local recurrences during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Systemic recurrence developed in four patients: two in the liver and two with peritoneal seeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall and disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 84.6% and 89.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previously published multicenter studies such as the COST, COLOR, and CLASICC trials, the long-term outcomes of this study demonstrate that transverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> can safely be resected using the laparoscopic technique in experienced hands </plain></SENT>
