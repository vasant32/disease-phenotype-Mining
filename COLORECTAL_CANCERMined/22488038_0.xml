<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even so, circadian parameter I&lt;O before chemotherapy independently predicted overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the relevance of I&lt;O measured during chemotherapy for survival and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The circadian rest-activity pattern was monitored for 3 days using a wristwatch actigraph while 77 patients were receiving a chemotherapy course within an international randomized Phase III trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of first-line chronomodulated or conventional delivery of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I&lt;O was computed as the percentage of minutes of activity counts in bed which were below the median of activity out of bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circadian disruption was defined by I&lt;O equal to or less than 97.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circadian disruption occurred in 39 patients (51%) on chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was associated with a significantly shorter overall survival, independently of other prognostic factors (multivariate Hazard Ratio: 2.12; p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival of patients with a robust circadian rhythm was 22.3 months as compared to 14.7 months in those with circadian disruption during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No toxicity was significantly associated with circadian disruption, but the incidence of grade ≥ 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and of body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> ≥ 5% was two and threefold higher, respectively, in patients with disrupted circadian rhythm on chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy disrupted circadian activity rhythm in nearly 50% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Circadian disruption on chemotherapy predicted for shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prevention of chemotherapy-induced circadian disruption might reduce toxicity and improve efficacy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
