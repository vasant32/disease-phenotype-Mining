<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed whether non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) differ in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (CC) survival in an equal-access healthcare system and examined whether racial differences varied by demographic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 2,537 Military Health System patients diagnosed with CC between 1998 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time was 31.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for race, overall and stratified by age at diagnosis, sex, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in overall survival (OS) between NHWs and NHBs was observed in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, among patients younger than 50 years old, NHBs experienced significantly worse OS than NHWs (HR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.48-3.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further stratification by sex and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage showed that this racial disparity was confined to women (HR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.30-6.00) and patients with distant stage disease (HR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.38-5.08) in this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When medical care is equally available to NHWs and NHBs, similar overall CC survival was observed; however, evidence of racial differences in survival was apparent for patients younger than 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that factors other than access to care may be related to racial disparities in CC survival among younger, but not older, patients </plain></SENT>
