<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the gene encoding human ULBP3 was cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pQE30, resulting in a recombinant plasmid pQE30-ULBP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pQE30-ULBP3 was transformed into Escherichia coli M15 and induced the expression of recombinant protein ULBP3 (rec-ULBP3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purified rec-ULBP3 as an antigen was used to immunize BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through cell fusion, sub-cloning, and screening approach, three hybridoma cell clones expressing monoclonal antibodies (MAb) were acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results from Western blot analysis, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the hybridoma clones B2-F1-F1 and B4-C5-D11, and not G2-A4-A12, reacted with rec-ULBP3 and nature ULBP3 expressed on the cell surface of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the new MAb described here provides a valuable tool for further investigating ULBP3 function and clinical application </plain></SENT>
