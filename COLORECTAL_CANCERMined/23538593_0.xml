<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the main limitations to its use is induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that vitamin E can reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of vitamin E for prevention of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING Prospective, phase II, randomized pilot study developed at a university hospital in the Greater ABC region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS Patients were randomized five days before starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> treatment, to receive either vitamin E or placebo until the end of the chemotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome was evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3, and specific gradation scales for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> who had been scheduled to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both groups received calcium and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> supplementation before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Eighteen patients were randomized to the vitamin E group and 16 to the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of 83% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> grades 1/2 was observed in the vitamin E group, versus 68% in the placebo group (P = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A trend towards more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> was observed among patients who received vitamin E (55.6% vs. 18.8%; P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
