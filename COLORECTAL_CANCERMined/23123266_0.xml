<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(Euphorbiaceae) is a traditional medicinal plant which produces a red sap, traditionally known as "Sangre de Drago"; it is used in folk medicine externally for wounds, fractures, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemorrhoids</z:e>, internally for intestinal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>stomach ulcers</z:hpo> and also for the empirical cure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of Croton lechleri sap and taspine in comparison with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi> and vinblastine on the growth of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines of SK23 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>), LoVo and HT29 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and Trypan blue assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, we studied cell cycle by flow cytometry and detected acetylated-α-tubulin by confocal microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Croton lechleri inhibited cell proliferation starting from 1 μg/mL in SK23 cells, whereas 10 times higher concentrations were required for growth inhibition of HT-29 and LoVo cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also taspine (0.1 μg/mL) inhibited the SK23 and HT29 cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, assay was assessed on SK23 and HT29 cell lines with 24-48 h treatment with sap and taspine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both sap and taspine inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell proliferation; taspine showed higher activity on SK23 cells, which was significantly increased after 48 h of SK23 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using confocal microscopy we observed that Croton lechleri (1 μg/mL) caused a loss of microtubule structure, whereas taspine (0.5 μg/mL) caused an increase in acetylated α-tubulin and a modification of cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, mainly in SK23 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Croton lechleri sap 10 and 50 μg/mL influence cell cycle; 50 μg/mL sap caused a dramatic reduction of cells in G(1)/G(0) and S phases with a great increase of subG(0) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that Croton lechleri and taspine could inhibit cell proliferation with higher potency against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> SK23 cells, supporting the empirical use of the sap as anticancer in ethnomedicine and taspine as a possible anticancer agent </plain></SENT>
