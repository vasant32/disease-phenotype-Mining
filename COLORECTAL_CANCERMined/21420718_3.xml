<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, disease progression occurs in a percentage of cases, although the causes of an adverse clinical course still remain to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed and compared the immunohistochemical expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, an iron-binding protein, which is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression, in series a of 29 surgically resected colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> obtained from patients who died of the disease and in a cohort of 22 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> from patients alive 5 years after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin expression on the overall survival to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variable neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin immunoexpression was demonstrated in 23 of the 51 analyzed cases, with a significantly higher frequency of positive cases among patients who died of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin expression appeared to be a significant independent negative prognostic marker related to shorter overall survival in stage I colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If our findings are confirmed in further analyses, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin assessment might be used to select patients with a higher risk of progression and to find adjuvant therapies for the prevention of adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
