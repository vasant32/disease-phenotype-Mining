<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although the anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody cetuximab is an effective strategy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> therapy, its clinical use is limited by intrinsic or acquired resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipid</z:chebi> rheostat"-the balance between the proapoptotic molecule <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> and the mitogenic factor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">sphingosine-1-phosphate</z:chebi> (S1P)-due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi> kinase 1 (SphK1) overactivation have been involved in resistance to anticancer-targeted agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cross-talks between SphK1 and EGFR-dependent signaling pathways have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental design: We investigated SphK1 contribution to cetuximab resistance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, in preclinical in vitro/in vivo models, and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens from patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SphK1 was found overexpressed and overactivated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells with intrinsic or acquired resistance to cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SphK1 contribution to resistance was supported by the demonstration that SphK1 inhibition by N,N-dimethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi> or silencing via siRNA in resistant cells restores sensitivity to cetuximab, whereas exogenous SphK1 overexpression in sensitive cells confers resistance to these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment of resistant cells with fingolimod (FTY720), a S1P receptor (S1PR) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, resulted in resensitization to cetuximab both in vitro and in vivo, with inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, interference with signal transduction, induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and prolongation of mice survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, a correlation between SphK1 expression and cetuximab response was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
