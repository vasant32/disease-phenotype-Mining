<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> at a potentially curable stage could improve survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic significance of commonly reported clinicopathologic features to identify high-risk patients who would likely benefit from more intensive chest surveillance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 351 consecutive patients, with surgical stages I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, who underwent curative resection at Phramongkutklao hospital from 1999 to 2005, were followed regularly according to the established guidelines with routine physical examination, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and colonoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging studies for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were computed tomography (CT), plain film radiography, and ultrasonograpy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and pathologic features were analyzed for their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 145 patients who had been operated for longer than five years after curative intent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, nineteen patients were lost to follow-up or died from other causes that were unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Pulmonary metastases</z:e> were detected in 26 patients by either CXR or CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> was 19 months (95 percent CI, 12-35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to an univariate analysis, with log-rank test, identified four factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> stage T4, Nodal stage N2, elevation of serum CEA &gt; 3.4 ng/ml and presence of lymphovascular invasion(LVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to a multivariate analysis, with Cox regression, found an elevation of serum CEA &gt; 3.4 ng/ml which was an independent factor that was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> (Hazard ratio (HR), 8.9; 95 percent CI, 3.6-22; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed that 50 percent of patients who had more than one of these risk factors would eventually develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An elevation of serum CEA &gt; or = 3.4 ng/ml was found as an independent factor that was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage T4, nodal stage N2 and presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were not independent clinicopathologic features associated with subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Chest CT scan has greater sensitivity than chest radiography in detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> and should be considered as an imaging study of choice for intensive chest surveillance for patients who had more than one of these risk factors </plain></SENT>
