<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify complications to the ileostomy, time until reversal, and risk factors for nonclosure or a permanent stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who received a loop ileostomy with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at index surgery in four hospitals in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, from January 1, 2007 until February 28, 2010 were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demography, events during index surgery, complications related to the ileostomy and technique, and complications during closure were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 262 patients received a loop ileostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loop iliostomies were constructed during emergency surgery in 15% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-three percent had complications related to the ileostomy; most common were high-volume output and leakage of stomal output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morbidity after closure was high, at 28%, and mortality was 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent had their stoma closed, median time 178 (3-700) d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for nonreversal were postoperative complications to index surgery and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent received a secondary stoma, and at the end of the study 23% had a permanent stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity related to loop ileostomies and loop ileostomy closure is considerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One in five patients will have a permanent stoma, and our conclusion is that for emergency patients with advanced disease another type of stoma should be chosen, if possible, to reduce the morbidity </plain></SENT>
