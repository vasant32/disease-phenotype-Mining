<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several states in the US have passed laws mandating coverage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening tests by health insurance plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of these state mandates on the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening has not been evaluated among an age-eligible target population with access to care (i.e., health care insurance coverage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected information on state mandates implemented by December 31, 2008 and used data on insured adults aged 50 and 64 years from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System between 2002 and 2008 to classify individual-level exposure to state mandates for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression models (with state- and year- fixed effects, and patient demographic and socioeconomic characteristics) were used to estimate the effect of state mandates on recent endoscopy screening (either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy during the past year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1999-2008, twenty-two states in the US, including the District of Columbia passed comprehensive laws requiring health insurance coverage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening including endoscopy tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Residence in states with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening coverage mandates in place for at least 1 year was associated with a 1.4 percentage point increase in the probability of utilization of recent endoscopy (i.e., 17.5% screening rates in those with mandates versus 16.1% in those without, Adjusted OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.20, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a positive, albeit small, impact of state mandates on the use of recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening endoscopy among the target eligible population with health insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, more research is needed to evaluate potential effects of mandates across health insurance types while including controls for other system-level factors (e.g. endoscopy and primary care capacity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>National health insurance reform should strive towards a system that expands access to recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests </plain></SENT>
