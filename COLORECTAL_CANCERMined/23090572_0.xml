<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, complete cytoreductive surgery associated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy achieves encouraging results in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC), but this early detection can only be accurately accomplished during a systematic second-look surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This costly and invasive approach can only be proposed to selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to identify risk factors predictive of developing PC after curative surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After a systematic review of the literature published between 1940 and 2011, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical studies reporting the incidence of PC after curative surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were searched for factors associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> that were likely to influence the incidence of recurrent PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen clinical studies were considered informative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonrandomized, three prospective and 13 retrospective, including 4-395 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the methodological quality of the reported studies was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were available for the following factors: synchronous PC, synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036527" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian metastases</z:e>, perforated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, serosal and/or adjacent organ invasion, histological subtype, and positive peritoneal cytology with reported incidences of recurrent PC between 8 and 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No study was found that mentioned an impact of lymph node invasion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, laparoscopy, occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> on recurrent PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Evidence regarding the incidence of recurrent PC after curative surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emerging data indicate three situations that could result in a real higher risk of recurrent PC: synchronous PC, synchronous isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036527" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian metastases</z:e>, and a perforated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
