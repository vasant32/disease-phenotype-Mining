<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efficacy seems restricted to KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG(1) may also induce antibody dependent cell mediated citotoxicity (ADCC) by recruitment of immune effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ADCC is influenced by Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of FcγR polymorphisms and disease control rate (DCR) in mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy plus Cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> tissues from 106 patients were screened for KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations using a sensitive multiplex assay (DxS, Manchester, United Kingdom) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NRAS (codons: 12, 13 and 61), PI3K (exon 20) and BRAF (exon 15) were analysed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fcγ RIIa and Fcγ RIIIa polymorphisms were genotyped by TaqMan assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DCR was significantly higher in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (61% versus 39%, p = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) downstream-mutated mCRC patients, those harbouring an FcγRIIa H/H genotype had a higher DCR than alternative genotypes (67% versus 33%, p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, FcγRIIa-131H/H remained significantly correlated with DCR (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FcγR polymorphisms may play a role in the clinical efficacy of Cetuximab in EGFR downstream mutated mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research into Cetuximab immune-based mechanisms in KRAS-mutated patients seems warranted </plain></SENT>
