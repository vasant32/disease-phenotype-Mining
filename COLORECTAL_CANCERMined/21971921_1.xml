<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better endoscopic recognition of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> is important, as this pathway may explain some of the post-colonoscopy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the endoscopic characteristics of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, single-center study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients referred for elective colonoscopy during 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endoscopists were familiarized with the detection and treatment of nonpolypoid colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were classified into high risk serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, defined as dysplastic or large (≥ 6 mm) proximal nondysplastic serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and low risk serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> including the remaining nondysplastic serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were defined as multiple (at least three),≥ 10 mm in size, high grade dysplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2309 patients were included (46.1 % men, mean age 58.4 years), of whom 2.5 % (57) had at least one high risk serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> and 13.9 % (322) had at least one advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were more often nonpolypoid than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (16.2 % vs. 11.1 %; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In total, 65 high risk serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were found, of which 43.1 % (28) displayed a nonpolypoid endoscopic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were more likely to have synchronous high risk serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> than patients without advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>: OR 3.66 (95 % CI 2.03 - 6.61, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High risk serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> are frequently nonpolypoid and are associated with synchronous advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> may therefore be considered red flags for the presence of high risk serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Detection, diagnosis, and treatment of high risk serrated lesions may be important targets to improve the quality of colonoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
