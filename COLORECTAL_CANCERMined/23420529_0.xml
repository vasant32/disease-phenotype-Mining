<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytohesins have been identified as cytoplasmic ErbB receptor activators in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, exhibiting an important role in ErbB signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether cytohesins are essential in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether cytohesins contribute to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and immunofluorescence experiments were employed to detect the expression of cytohesins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EGF pathway activation conditions were investigated by examining the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and intracellular signal-related kinases, with or without chemical inhibition (SecinH3) and knockdown of cytohesins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was conducted to examine the inhibitory effect of SecinH3 and cytohesin-specific siRNA in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrated that the four homologous members of the cytohesin family were expressed in the four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, a significantly higher expression level of cytohesin-2 (ARNO) compared with the other three homologous family members was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stimulation with EGF and SecinH3, as well as knockdown of ARNO, are capable of reducing EGF pathway activation and proliferation of HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cytohesins play an essential role in the activation of the EGF pathway and may be a potential target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
