<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, who had PET/CT, were identified between 2008 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had CT scans prior to the PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from clinic letters, CT and PET CT reports and pathology results and cross-checked with the patient's notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were aged between 43 and 85 years [33 males, 27 females] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CEA was raised in 37 patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of PET/CT were compared with that of CT scan and 33 out of the 60 patients (55%) had PET/CT results which were different to that of CT scan and 27 patients (45%) had similar PET/CT and CT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PET scan appropriately altered the management in 23/60 patients (38%) and avoided unnecessary surgery in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PET/CT had a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with an unexplained rise in CEA, PET/CT was positive in only one out of ten (10%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PET/CT is valuable in deciding the management outcome in patients with metastatic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unnecessary surgery might be avoided by careful use of PET/CT scanning in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PET/CT might not be of value in patients with an unexplained rise in CEA </plain></SENT>
