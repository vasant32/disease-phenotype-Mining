<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate whether CIST affects these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a prospective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> database, patients undergoing colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> between 1996 and 2005 and on CIST (steroids and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi>, FK-506, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>) were identified and compared with a control group matched for age(±5 year), gender, type, and year (±2 year) of operation; American Society of Anesthesiology score; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage; differentiation; vascular invasion; blood transfusion; and postoperative adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups were compared for early and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox models produced hazard ratios and Wald P values to assess associations between survival and the presence of immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five (20 female and 35 male) patients were on CIST for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>, transplantation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006536'>obstructive lung disease</z:hpo>, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003348'>hypopituitarism</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups were comparable for the matched characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> immunosuppressive therapy and control groups had similar overall postoperative morbidity (36.4% vs 27.3%, P = 0.3) and wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates (14.5% vs 5.5%, P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> immunosuppressive therapy group had significantly lower 3- and 5-year overall (49.1% vs 76.3%, and 45.1% vs 66.2%, respectively, P = 0.003) and disease-free survival (45.5% vs 69.1%, and 41.7% vs 63.3%, respectively, P = 0.005) than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence was similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immunosuppression tolerate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection but have significantly worse long-term oncologic outcomes.These findings need careful consideration when evaluating the relative roles of the various treatment modalities for this group of patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
