<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was conducted in order to demonstrate changing trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence according to sex, age group, and anatomical location in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Korea Central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry between 1999 and 2009 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Annual percent changes (APCs) of sex- and age-specific incidence rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of the proximal colon (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10] code C18.0-18.5), distal colon (C18.6-18.7), and rectum (C19-20), and male-to-female incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 27 (per 100,000) in 1999 and increased to 50.2 in 2009 among men (APC, 6.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ASR for women was 17.2 in 1999 and 26.9 in 2009 (APC, 5.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rectum was the most common site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> among both men and women during 1999 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the distal colon had the highest APC (10.8% among men and 8.4% among women), followed by the proximal colon (7.9% among men and 6.6% among women), and rectum (5.2% among men and 2.4% among women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> decreased from 51.5% in 1999 to 47.1% in 2009 among men, and from 50.5% to 42.8% among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in the male-to-female IRR was observed for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, whereas the IRR for proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rapid increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence is mainly attributed to the increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, especially distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and may be explained by a transition of risk factors for subsites or by the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
