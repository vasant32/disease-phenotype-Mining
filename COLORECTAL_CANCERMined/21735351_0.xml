<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Changes in splanchnic circulation have been seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that the inferior mesenteric vein is dilated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wanted to assess whether the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) is dilated in right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a colorectal database, three cohorts were formed: right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SMV (2 cm proximal to the confluence of the SMV and portal vein) and the gastrocolic trunk (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>) were saved and anonymized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The short-axis diameter of the vein was measured independently by three radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diameter of the SMV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e> was higher in the right colon group than the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation with the stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (locoregional or metastatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> showed a significantly increased mean SMV diameter at presentation, which may be due to increased venous return secondary to neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to evaluate this further </plain></SENT>
