<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Low-level mutations in clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples often reside below mutation detection limits, thus leading to false negatives that may impact clinical diagnosis and patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>COLD-PCR (coamplification at lower denaturation temperature PCR) is a technology that magnifies unknown mutations during PCR, thus enabling downstream mutation detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a practical difficulty in applying COLD-PCR has been the requirement for strict control of the denaturation temperature for a given sequence, to within ±0.3 °C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This requirement precludes simultaneous mutation enrichment in sequences of substantially different melting temperature (T(m)) and limits the technique to a single sequence at a time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present a temperature-tolerant (TT) approach (TT-COLD-PCR) that reduces this obstacle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe thermocycling programs featuring a gradual increase of the denaturation temperature during COLD-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach enabled enrichment of mutations when the cycling achieves the appropriate critical denaturation temperature of each DNA amplicon that is being amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Validation was provided for KRAS (v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene homolog) and TP53 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> protein p53) exons 6-9 by use of dilutions of mutated DNA, clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples, and plasma-circulating DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A single thermocycling program with a denaturation-temperature window of 2.5-3.0 °C enriches mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DNA amplicons simultaneously, despite their different T(m)s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutation enrichments of 6-9-fold were obtained with TT-full-COLD-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher mutation enrichments were obtained for the other 2 forms of COLD-PCR, fast-COLD-PCR, and ice-COLD-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-level mutations in diverse amplicons with different T(m)s can be mutation enriched via TT-COLD-PCR provided that their T(m)s fall within the denaturation-temperature window applied during amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This approach enables simultaneous enrichment of mutations in several amplicons and increases significantly the versatility of COLD-PCR </plain></SENT>
