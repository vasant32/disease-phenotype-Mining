<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BBI can survive both acidic conditions and the action of proteolytic enzymes within the stomach and small intestine, permitting significant amounts to reach the large intestine in active form to exert their reported anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we reported the ability of a recombinant form of TI1B (rTI1B), representing a major BBI isoinhibitor from pea, to influence negatively the growth of human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> HT29 cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigate if this effect is related directly to the intrinsic ability of BBI to inhibit serine proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rTI1B and a novel engineered mutant, having amino acid substitutions at the P1 positions in the two inhibitory domains, were expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rTI1B proved to be active against trypsin and chymotrypsin, showing K i values at nanomolar concentrations, whereas the related mutant protein was inactive against both serine proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of HT29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells was significantly affected by rTI1B in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 31 (sd 7) Î¼m), whereas the inactive mutant did not show any significant effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, neither recombinant protein affected the growth of non-malignant colonic fibroblast CCD-18Co cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that serine proteases should be considered as important targets in investigating the potential chemopreventive role of BBI during the early stages of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
