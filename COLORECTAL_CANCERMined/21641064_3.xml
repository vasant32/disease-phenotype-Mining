<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze local control of oligometastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> (OLTs) compared with that of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective record review of patients with OLTs who received SBRT with 50Gy in 5 fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local control rates (LCRs), toxicities, and factors of prognostic significance were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one colorectal OLTs, 23 OLTs from other origins, and 188 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancers</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> origin was prognostically significant (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1-year/2-year LCRs in colorectal OLTs and OLTs from other origins were 80%/72% and 94%/94%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LCR in colorectal OLTs was significantly worse than that in OLTs from the other origins and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancers</z:e> with pathological and clinical diagnosis (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 44 OLT patients, Grades 2 and 3 radiation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> were identified in 2 and 1 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other toxicities of more than Grade 3 occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SBRT for OLTs is tolerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The LCR for OLTs from origins other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, LCR for colorectal OLTs is worse than that from other origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore dose escalation should be considered to achieve good local control for colorectal OLTs </plain></SENT>
