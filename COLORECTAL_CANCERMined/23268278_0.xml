<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data of 189 patients with stage IIII( <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergoing palliative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> in the presence of unresectable synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-six (45.5%)patients developed postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative predictors of medical complications included age(â‰¥65, P=0.039) and emergency operations (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative predictors of surgical complications included advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> (T4, P=0.022) and lymph node spread (N2, P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (9.0%) patients died in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was independently associated with age(P=0.013), peritoneal dissemination(P=0.010), emergency operations(P=0.001) and medical complications(P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival rates at 1-, 2-, and 3- year of 172 patients admitted in survival analysis were 41.2%, 22.7% and 7.7% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent factors associated with poor overall survival included lymph node spread(N2, P=0.015) and poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation(P=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Emergency operations should be avoid when palliative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> is considered for stage IIII( <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, especially for elderly patients and those with peritoneal dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The significance of palliative resection is limited for stage IIII( <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with lymph node spread and poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation </plain></SENT>
