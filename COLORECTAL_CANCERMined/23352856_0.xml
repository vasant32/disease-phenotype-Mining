<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate a magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>)/ultrasound (US) coregistration system with US used in follow-up diagnostic studies of lesions originally identified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center prospective study enrolled 21 consecutive patients (age, 64.0 y±7.5; eight men [age, 63.0 y±7.1] and 13 women [age, 65.0 y±7.3]) evaluated for potential surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent same-day <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination and two US examinations: one regular and one with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>/US coregistration system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Target lesions were identified on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, and US was used in follow-up diagnostic studies of lesions originally identified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During US, two outcome measures (target localization success and target localization time) were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ratios of lesions found per patient were compared with a paired Wilcoxon test, and a Student t test was used to compare target localization time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ratios of lesions found per patient with the coregistered system (93.7%) and conventional US (73.3%) were statistically different (P =.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions found by the coregistration system but not conventional US were statistically smaller than those found by both systems (6.1 mm±4.0 vs 15.6 mm±9.8; P&lt;.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference in target localization time for detection of lesions found by coregistered (100 s±89) and conventional US (108 s±86; P = .78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>/US coregistration system increases the number of lesions detected with US versus standard US alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may prove beneficial in surgical and nonsurgical management of patients with focal liver lesions </plain></SENT>
