<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prehabilitation aims to enhance functional capacity preoperatively for better toleration of surgery and to facilitate recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors previously demonstrated the limited impact of a prehabilitation program using exercise alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They propose an expanded trimodal prehabilitation program that adds nutritional counseling, protein supplementation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> reduction to a moderate exercise program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to estimate the impact of this trimodal program on the recovery of functional capacity compared with standard surgical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients were enrolled in this pre- and postintervention study over a 23-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postoperative recovery for 42 consecutive patients enrolled in the prehabilitation program was compared with that of 45 patients assessed before the intervention began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was functional walking capacity (6-min walk test [6MWT]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcomes included self-reported physical activity (CHAMPS questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (SF-36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]) and were analyzed using Chi-square and Student's t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> p values lower than 0.05 were considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prehabilitation and control groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and American Society of Anesthesiology (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in walking capacity at the first assessment (6MWT distance, 422 ± 87 vs 402 ± 57 m; p = 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the prehabilitation period lasting a median of 33 days (range, 21-46 days), functional walking capacity improved by 40 ± 40 m (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The postoperative complication rates and the hospital length of stay were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patients in the prehabilitation program had better postoperative walking capacity at both 4 weeks (mean difference, 51.5 ± 93 m; p = 0.01) and 8 weeks (mean difference, 84.5 ± 83 m; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At 8 weeks, 81 % of the prehabilitated patients were recovered compared with 40 % of the control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The prehabilitation group also reported higher levels of physical activity before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, a 1-month trimodal prehabilitation program improved postoperative functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A randomized trial is ongoing (NCT01356264) </plain></SENT>
