<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening requires sufficient endoscopic resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to determine the Dutch endoscopic production and manpower for 2009, evaluate trends since 2004, determine additional workload which would be caused by implementation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program, and inventory colonoscopy rates performed in other European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Dutch endoscopy units (N = 101) were surveyed for manpower and the numbers of endoscopy procedures performed in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on calculations in the report issued by the Dutch Health Council, future additional workload caused by faecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of colonoscopies performed in Europe was evaluated by a literature search and an email-inquiry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to 2004, there was a 24% increase in total endoscopies (N = 505,226 in 2009), and a 64% increase in colonoscopies (N = 191,339 in 2009) in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of endoscopists had increased by 4.6% (N = 583 in 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five years after stepwise implementation of FIT-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, endoscopic capacity needs to be increased an additional 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A lack of published data on the number of endoscopies performed in Europe was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on our email-inquiry, the number of colonoscopies per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 126 to 3,031 in 15 European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Over the last years, endoscopic procedures increased markedly in The Netherlands without a corresponding increase in manpower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A FIT-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program requires an estimated additional 15% increase in endoscopic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is very likely that current colonoscopy density varies widely across European countries </plain></SENT>
