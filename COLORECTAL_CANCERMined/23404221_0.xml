<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relevance of CD44s and CD44v6 to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the clinical importance of CD44s and CD44v6 and their relevance to EMT in 113 patients with stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated by curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relevance of CD44v6 knockdown to the phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells was examined using small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) specific for CD44v6 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD44v6 expression showed a significant inverse correlation with E-cadherin expression (P=0.0007) and a positive correlation with vimentin expression (P=0.0096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed that high CD44v6 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P=0.01, HR=3.05) and overall survival (P=0.025, HR=3.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance and the relevance of CD44s expression to EMT markers was noted to a lesser extent compared to CD44v6 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The knockdown of CD44v6 decreased vimentin expression, cell invasion and HGF-induced cell migration, but conferred only a slight effect on E-cadherin expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells (HCT116 and LoVo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD44v6 is related to poor outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> via upregulation of the mesenchymal phenotype </plain></SENT>
