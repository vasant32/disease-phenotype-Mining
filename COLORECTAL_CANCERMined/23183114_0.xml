<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nuclear localization of phosphorylated or activated ERK is involved in the invasive behavior of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between Ras mutation/ERK activation and the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 126 surgically resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens for K-Ras mutation using direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation/phosphorylation of ERK was assayed by immunohistochemistry with tissue microarray, and the staining intensity was analyzed using a semiquantitative scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>K-Ras mutations were detected in 32.5% (41/126) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colorectal glands are important functional organs in colorectal tissue and form the origin of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry tests showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens were significantly stained for phospho-ERK (100%; 126/126), whereas nonneoplastic colorectal glands mainly showed faint phosphorylated ERK staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High nuclear phospho-ERK expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was associated with highly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> stage and T status of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that nuclear but not cytoplasmic phosphorylated ERK expression correlated with the patients' overall survival rate (P = .039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> including tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and tubulovillous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> mainly showed weak cytoplasmic phospho-ERK expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that immunohistologic analysis of phosphorylated ERK expression in colorectal glands may aid the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and that nuclear phosphorylated ERK might be a valuable prognostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
