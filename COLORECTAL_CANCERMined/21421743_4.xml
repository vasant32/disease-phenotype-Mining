<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were to examine whether sedentary work is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and to determine whether the association differs by subsite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 918 cases and 1,021 controls participated in a population-based case-control study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Western Australia in 2005-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on lifestyle, physical activity, and lifetime job history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated effects of sedentary work on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum were analyzed by using multinomial logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with participants who did not spend any time in sedentary work, participants who spent 10 or more years in sedentary work had almost twice the risk of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio = 1.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.28, 2.93) and a 44% increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (adjusted odds ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.96, 2.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association was independent of recreational physical activity and was seen even among the most recreationally active participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sedentary work was not associated with the risk of proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that long-term sedentary work may increase the risk of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
