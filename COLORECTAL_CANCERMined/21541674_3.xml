<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the reasons is the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific diagnostic and prognostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the correlation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9) expressions in serum and clinicopathological features of the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another aim was to examine expression of MMP-9 in the tissue of the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in MMP-9 serum positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we tried to establish the correlation between preoperative levels of serum markers (CEA and CA 19-9) and presence of MMP-2 or MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was performed on 32 patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> who underwent surgery and 11 patients in a control group who were operated for benign diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The samples were analyzed by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE to determine the molecular mass and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE zymography to determine levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of MMP-9 was determined immunohistochemically in the tissue of the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of MMP-9 serum positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were increased in the serum of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was significant correlation in MMPs levels among the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage I and II and the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Obtained results did not demonstrate correlation between levels of CEA, CA 19-9 and presence of MMP-2 or MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 expression was positive in 85% of MMP-9 serum positive patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
