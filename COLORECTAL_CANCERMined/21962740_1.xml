<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goals of this study were to evaluate whether administrative data can accurately identify patients with CRCLM and to develop a diagnostic algorithm capable of identifying such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to validate the diagnostic and procedural codes found in administrative databases of the Veterans Administration (VA) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients evaluated at a major VA center were identified (1997-2008, n = 1671) and classified as having liver-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 and/or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of CRCLM was verified by primary chart abstraction in the study sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contingency tables were created and the positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) for CRCLM was calculated for each candidate administrative code </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic-regression model was used to identify independent predictors (codes) of CRCLM, which were used to develop a diagnostic algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Validity of the algorithm was determined by discrimination (c-statistic) of the model and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of the algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 diagnosis codes 155.2 (OR 9.7 [95% CI 2.5-38.4]) and 197.7 (84.6 [52.9-135.3]), and procedure code 50.22 (5.9 [1.3-25.5]) as independent predictors of CRCLM diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The model's discrimination was 0.89 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic algorithm, defined as the presence of any of these codes, had a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VA administrative databases reliably identify patients with CRCLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This diagnostic algorithm is highly predictive of CRCLM diagnosis and can be used for research studies evaluating population-level features of this disease within the VA system </plain></SENT>
