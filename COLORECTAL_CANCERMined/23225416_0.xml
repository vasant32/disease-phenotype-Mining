<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is used to treat patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, including those who will undergo liver surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of this agent on the regenerative capacity of the liver are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a rabbit model of partial hepatectomy to assess the effects of bevacizumab on hepatocyte replication and the expression of genes relevant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty rabbits underwent 28% hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the procedure, animals were blindly randomized into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group was injected i.v. with saline and the other group with bevacizumab at 50 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three rabbits from each group were sacrificed at days 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 after hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Livers were collected and processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hepatocyte proliferation was evaluated by Ki-67 immunostaining and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by caspase-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gene expression of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Inhibitor α of nuclear factor-κB (IκBα) was determined by quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, hepatocyte proliferation in bevacizumab-treated animals was decreased 1.8-fold at day 3, 1.6-fold at day 5 and 2.1-fold at day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neoangiogenesis began after day 5, with a peak of VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> evident at day 7 in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Expression of IκBα, a transcriptional target of Nuclear Factor-κB, increased significantly from baseline only in the control group: at day 2, expression was 179% of the day 0 value in controls versus 112% in the bevacizumab group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Expression of HGF and caspase-3 was similar in the two groups and remained stable over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A single i.v. injection of bevacizumab impaired hepatocyte proliferation in a rabbit model of partial hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
