<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although small rectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid tumors</z:hpo> can be treated using local excision, complete resection can be difficult because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are located in the submucosal layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the factors associated with pathologically complete local resection of rectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid tumors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analyzed of 161 patients with 166 rectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid tumors</z:hpo> who underwent local excision with curative intent from January 2001 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pathologically complete resection (P-CR) was defined as an en bloc resection with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free lateral and deep margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study classified treatments into three categories for analysis: conventional polypectomy (including strip biopsy, snare polypectomy, and hot biopsy), advanced endoscopic techniques (including endoscopic mucosal resection with cap and endoscopic submucosal dissection), and surgical local excision (including transanal excision and transanal endoscopic microsurgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the P-CR rate according to treatment method, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, initial endoscopic impression and the use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 5.51 ± 2.43 mm (range 2-18 mm) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions were confined to the submucosal layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The P-CR rates were 30.9, 72.0, and 81.8 % for conventional polypectomy, advanced endoscopic techniques, and surgical local excision, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that P-CR was associated with treatment method, use of EUS or TRUS, and initial endoscopic impression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that only treatment method was associated with P-CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pathologically complete resection of small rectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid tumors</z:hpo> was more likely to be achieved when using advanced endoscopic techniques or surgical local excision rather than conventional polypectomy </plain></SENT>
