<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colorectal stent insertion is an invasive endoscopic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no reports regarding the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> with colorectal stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was to evaluate the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> and infectious complications after stent insertion for colorectal obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who underwent colorectal stent insertion were enrolled consecutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood cultures were obtained before colorectal stent insertion and at 30 min after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored for 48 h after colorectal stent insertion to detect the development of infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedural data collected included location of obstruction, degree of bowel preparation, obstructive symptoms, and the time required for the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 64 patients undergoing colorectal stent, four (6.3%) had a positive post-stent blood culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, including those with positive cultures, remained asymptomatic during the 48 h after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Site of obstruction, degree of bowel preparation, age, and underlying disease were not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> was associated with long procedure time (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal stent insertion does not induce significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> in patients with colorectal obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics may not be necessary in colorectal stent insertion </plain></SENT>
