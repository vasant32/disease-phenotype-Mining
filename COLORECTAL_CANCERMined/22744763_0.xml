<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening of the MUTYH gene was carried on index cases of 10 unrelated Tunisian families and on available DNA samples from some members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three germline mutations: c.536A &gt; G (p.Y179C), c.1187 G &gt; A (p.G396D) and c.1227_1228dup (p.Glu410GlyfsX43), were identified in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in 8 out of 10 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The c.1227_1228dup (p.Glu410GlyfsX43) mutation was the most frequent, since it was found in biallelic homozygous in 7 probands and 2 members of family F1 and in compound heterozygous associated with the c.536 A &gt; G (p.Y179C) or c.1187 G &gt; A (p.G396D) in family F2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis revealed that the 8 families are unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the c.1227_1228dup (p.Glu410GlyfsX43) mutation was identified in 13 % of patients compared to the p.G396D and p.Y179C found in 1.2 and 2.12 % respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data shows the high prevalence of the p.Glu410GlyfsX43 mutation in Tunisian families affected with MUTYH associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
