<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> 6-9 mm based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are likely to have advanced histologic features in Asian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We estimated the risk of advanced colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (ACN) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> &lt;10 mm and the risk of ACN detection failure if patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> &lt;10 mm are not referred for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 1457 subjects from the Asia-Pacific Working Group on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and the Hong Kong <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> and ACN found during colonoscopy examinations were classified by size and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the subjects, 38.2% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>; 16.7% of these were ACN, 5.4% of ACN were â‰¤5 mm, and 24.7% of the ACN were 6-9 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adopting the policy of reporting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> found by CTC of &lt;5 mm as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and repeating CTC in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of 6-9 mm, 5.4% of subjects with ACN, 4.5% of male subjects, and 11.5% of subjects with family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> would be classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In referring patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of 6-9 mm for CTC surveillance, 20.4% of those with ACN, 22.4% of those that are male, and 23.1% of those with family histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> would have polypectomies delayed by at least 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> &lt;10 mm have advanced histologic features in Asia, so patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> of 6 mm or more at CTC should be offered colonoscopies with polypectomies, rather than CTC surveillance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
