<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Earlier analyses within the EPIC study showed that dietary fibre intake was inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, but results from some large cohort studies do not support this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored whether the association remained after longer follow-up with a near threefold increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases, and if the association varied by gender and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After a mean follow-up of 11.0 years, 4,517 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total, cereal, fruit, and vegetable fibre intakes were estimated from dietary questionnaires at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age, sex, and centre, and adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, education, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive use, and intakes of alcohol, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, red and processed meats, and calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustments, total dietary fibre was inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HR per 10 g/day increase in fibre 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar linear associations were observed for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between total dietary fibre and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk did not differ by age, sex, or anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fibre from cereals and fibre from fruit and vegetables were similarly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>; but for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, the inverse association was only evident for fibre from cereals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strengthen the evidence for the role of high dietary fibre intake in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
