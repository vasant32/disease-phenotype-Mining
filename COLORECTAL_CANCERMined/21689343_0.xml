<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A randomized controlled trial was carried out in which patients undergoing resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> were allocated to patent V blue or no patent blue V dye submucosal injection of the operative specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of lymph nodes found in each group was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1 January and 31 December 2008, 68 patients were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients received patent blue V dye and 34 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the former group the median number of blue nodes identified was 11, compared with a median of 9 in the no dye group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the application of Carnoy's solution lymph node count was 16 in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ex vivo injection of patent blue V dye submucosally in a peritumour location did not increase the lymph node count or the percentage of specimens having more than 12 lymph nodes identified </plain></SENT>
