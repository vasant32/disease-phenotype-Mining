<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is currently approved for advanced hepatocellular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> in humans, where its major mechanism of action is thought to be through inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether pixel-by-pixel analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is better able to capture the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> response of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">Sorafenib</z:chebi> in a murine model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> xenografts (as compared with region of interest analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed on a 9.4 T pre-clinical scanner on the initial treatment day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then either vehicle or drug were gavaged daily (3 days) up to the final image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four days later, the mice were again imaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two-compartment model and reference tissue method of DCE-MRI were used to analyze the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the contrast agent distribution rate constant (K(trans)) were significantly reduced (p &lt;â€…0.005) at day-4 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">Sorafenib</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the K(trans) of nearby muscle was also reduced after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">Sorafenib</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pixel-by-pixel analysis (compared to region of interest analysis) was better able to capture the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and the decrease in K(trans) four days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For both methods, the volume of the extravascular extracellular space did not change significantly after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that parameters such as K(trans), could provide a non-invasive biomarker to assess the response to anti-angiogenic therapies such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">Sorafenib</z:chebi>, but that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of response across a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> requires a more detailed analysis than has typically been undertaken </plain></SENT>
