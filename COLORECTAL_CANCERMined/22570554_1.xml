<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been partly attributed to successfully incorporating new drugs into combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, molecularly targeted agents began to play an important role in the treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, two classes of molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment of patients with mCRC: (1) antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents (such as bevacizumab and aflibercept) and (2) antiendothelial cell growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) agents (such as cetuximab and panitumumab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aflibercept is a new member of anti-VEGF agents which has demonstrated efficacy for treatment of mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the commencement of clinical trials and basic research into aflibercept, more data from the bedside and the bench have been obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review will outline the application of anti-VEGF agents by reviewing clinic experiences of bevacizumab and aflibercept, and try to add perspectives on the use of anti-VEGF agents in mCRC </plain></SENT>
