<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the socioeconomic, cultural, and health care context within which decisions about colonoscopy are made allows physicians to address patients' most salient beliefs and values and other constraints when making screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the direct and interactive effects of socioeconomics, health care variables, psychological characteristics, and cultural values on colonoscopy use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: National survey completed between January-August 2009 in a random sample of African American, white, and Hispanic adults ages 50-75 without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 582) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN MEASURE: Self-reported colonoscopy use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Only 59% of respondents reported having a colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of colonoscopy increased with having health insurance (OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.24, 6.43, p = 0.004), and increasing age (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.77, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, respondents with greater self-efficacy were more likely to have a colonoscopy (OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.35, 4.29, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Programs that help patients to overcome access and psychological barriers to screening are needed </plain></SENT>
