<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Improved non-invasive strategies for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection are urgently needed to reduce morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, such as microRNAs and small nucleolar <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, have been proposed as biomarkers for non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyzing serum derived from <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice implanted with primary human <z:mp ids='MP_0009151'>pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009151'>PDAC</z:mp>), we identified 15 diagnostic microRNA candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of those miR-1246 was selected based on its high abundance in serum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> carrying mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we noted a cross reactivity of the established miR-1246 assays with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> fragments derived from U2 small nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (RNU2-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we found that the assay signal discriminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> from controls was derived from U2 small nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (snRNA) fragments (RNU2-1f) and not from miR-1246 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed a remarkable stability of RNU2-1f in serum and provide experimental evidence that hsa-miR-1246 is likely a pseudo microRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a next step, RNU2-1f was measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to cel-54 in 191 serum/plasma samples from <z:mp ids='MP_0009151'>PDAC</z:mp> and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison to 129 controls, we were able to classify samples as cancerous with a sensitivity and specificity of 97.7% [95% CI = (87.7, 99.9)] and 90.6% [95% CI = (80.7, 96.5)], respectively [area under the ROC curve 0.972] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of note, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were detected with our assay as early as UICC Stage II with a sensitivity of 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this is the first report showing that fragments of U2 snRNA are highly stable in serum and plasma and may serve as novel diagnostic biomarker for <z:mp ids='MP_0009151'>PDAC</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for future prospective screening studies </plain></SENT>
