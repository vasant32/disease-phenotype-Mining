<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study proposed to evaluate the impact of this classification on the clinical outcome of patients with malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Registry, 105 patients with endoscopically removed malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of one of the following histological features defined malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> as high-risk: infiltrated resection-margin, poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, lymphatic/vascular invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> budding and depth of submucosal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Available literature was reviewed by applying a similar classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were pedunculated and were localized in the left colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were classified as low-risk lesions and 50 as high-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients at low-risk died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients at high-risk, three died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases showed lymphatic/vascular invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Review of the literature reveals that an unfavourable clinical outcome is significantly more prevalent in the high-risk compared with the low-risk group (p &gt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histological risk factors show a specific predictive value of clinical adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study and the pooled data analysis confirmed the usefulness of the subdivision into low- and high-risk malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> for management of patients with endoscopically removed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
