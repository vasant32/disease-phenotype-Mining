<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prognostic indices are needed to optimize end-of-life care for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients at home, but few prognostic indices predict the last 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify predictors for the last 10 and 3 days of life in patients with lung, gastric, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Symptoms and signs were initially identified by literature review, and questionnaire was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of these items and identification of additional items were then performed by 72 visiting nurses using the 3-round Delphi approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The evaluation of 31 third-round responses is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The items for gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were almost same; these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were treated as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To predict the last 10 and 3 days, there were 6 and 0 specific items for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, respectively, and 5 and 13 specific items for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 9 common items to predict the last 10 days and 29 common items to predict the last 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The specific and common items that could be used to predict the last 10 and 3 days in patients with lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prognostic items for the last 3 days of life were more numerous among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> than those for the last 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Specific prognostic items for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are useful for visiting nurses to offer individualized care to patients and families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using the specific and common prognostic items, end-of-life care may be improved </plain></SENT>
