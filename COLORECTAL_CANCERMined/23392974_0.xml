<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial scepticism over the oncological adequacy of resection has been dismissed by a number of major randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence indicates that laparoscopic surgery may provide a potential survival benefit in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic or open resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between October 2003 and December 2010 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collated and a database compiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 665 resections were performed with 457 laparoscopically and 208 open </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median length of stay was 4 days following laparoscopic resection and 7 days following open (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups apart from gender (p = 0.03), <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (p = 0.03), and the number of patients with extranodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival (OS) in the completed laparoscopic group was 75.8 versus 72.5 % in the open group (p = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year OS in patients who were converted was 52 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 5-year OS for nonmetastatic disease in the completed laparoscopic group was significantly greater at 79.4 versus 74 % in the open group (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the groups in OS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (p = 0.66), but there was an OS advantage for laparoscopically resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic resection for nonmetastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> may provide an overall survival advantage </plain></SENT>
