<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limited data on the long-term outcome of implementing systematic management strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Survival of a national cohort of patients treated surgically for colonic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> over a 10-year interval was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 31 158 patients in Norway diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon and rectum between 1994 and 2003 were identified from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry of Norway and the Norwegian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in 5-year relative survival were compared by age, stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location during the early and late years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population included 19 053 patients who had a curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative 5-year survival rate significantly improved for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> (73·8 versus 78·0 per cent; P &lt; 0·001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (72·1 versus 79·6 per cent; P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year relative survival was significantly better for rectal than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> during the late period (P = 0·030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved 5-year relative survival was related to better outcomes in patients with positive lymph nodes (67·2 and 62·1 per cent for rectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> respectively; each P &lt; 0·001 versus early period), but not for the subgroup aged over 75 years with lymph node-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this national cohort, survival after curative surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> increased significantly after implementation of national management strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvements were most evident for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and in lymph node-positive disease; they were less substantial for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> and elderly patients (over 75 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strategic treatment changes may be warranted for the latter group </plain></SENT>
