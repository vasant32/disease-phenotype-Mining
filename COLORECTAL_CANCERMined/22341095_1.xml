<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening allows early detection and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We describe pilot projects conducted from 2005 to 2010 to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates among AN populations living in rural and remote Alaska </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Projects included training rural mid-level providers in flexible sigmoidoscopy, provision of itinerant endoscopy services at rural tribal health facilities, the creation and use of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> first-degree relative database to identify and screen individuals at increased risk, and support and implementation of screening navigator services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Alaska Tribal Health System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: AN population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Itinerant endoscopy, patient navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: AN patients screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, colonoscopy quality measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As a result of these ongoing efforts, statewide AN <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates increased from 29% in 2000 to 41% in 2005 before the initiation of these projects and increased to 55% in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The provision of itinerant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening clinics increased rural screening rates, as did outreach to average-risk and increased-risk (family history) ANs by patient navigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, health care system barriers were identified as major obstacles to screening completion, even in the presence of dedicated patient navigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Continuing challenges include geography, limited health system capacity, high staff turnover, and difficulty getting patients to screening appointments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The projects described here aimed to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates in an innovative and sustainable fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The issues and solutions described may provide insight for others working to increase screening rates among geographically dispersed and diverse populations </plain></SENT>
