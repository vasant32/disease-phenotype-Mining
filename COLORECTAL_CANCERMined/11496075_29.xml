<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Perioperative blood transfusion and subsequent development of postoperative infectious complications may lead to poor prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the development of postoperative infectious complications may be related to the storage time of the transfused blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the relationship between blood storage time and the development of disease recurrence and long-term survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative data were prospectively recorded in 740 patients undergoing elective resection for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients received preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy or radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were overall survival and disease recurrence in the subgroup of patients operated on with curative intention who also survived the first 30 days after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Storage of buffy-coat-depleted red cells suspended in saline, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> blood for 21 days was used as cut-off point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up was 6.8 years (range, 5.4 years to 7.9 years), and median overall survival was 4.6 years for 288 nontransfused patients and 3.0 years for 452 transfused patients (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival of patients receiving blood exclusively stored &lt; 21 days was 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients receiving any blood stored &gt; or = 21 days, survival was 3.7 years (P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among patients with curative resection (n = 532), the hazard ratio of disease recurrence was 1.5 (95 percent CI; 1.1 to 2.2) and 1.0 (95 percent CI; 0.7 to 1.4) in the two transfused groups, respectively, compared with the nontransfused group after multivariable correction for patient age, gender, colonic/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumor</z:e> localization, Dukes classification, blood loss, and postoperative infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transfusion of buffy-coat-depleted red cells suspended in saline, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> blood stored for &lt; 21 days may be an independent risk factor for development of recurrence after elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
