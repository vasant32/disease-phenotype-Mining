<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prediction of poor patient outcome as a effect of adjuvant therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage II colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) remains a matter of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> expression of CD10 and CD15 is reportedly related to poor outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether the expression of CD10 and CD15 is a predictor of outcome and the effect of adjuvant therapy in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical analyses for CD10 and CD15 and some additional markers (CD11b, CD14, CD163, CD3, and CD20) were performed using paraffin sections of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens from 57 patients who had undergone curative surgical treatments between 1998 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty of these patients received postoperative adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We distinguished between expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (tCD10 and tCD15), in stromal cells (sCD10), and infiltrating immune cells (iCD10 and iCD15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of iCD10 was observed in 21.1% (12/57) of the specimens examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expression patterns, only iCD10 expression at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> invasion front was a useful predictor of a disease-free period and overall survival in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant therapy improved the outcome of iCD10(+) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD10(+) immune cells were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in origin and partially overlapped the cells positive for myeloid lineage markers, including CD11b and CD15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: iCD10 expression at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion front is a useful marker for predicting a high risk of recurrence and mortality in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD10(+) immune cells appear to be of myeloid origin </plain></SENT>
