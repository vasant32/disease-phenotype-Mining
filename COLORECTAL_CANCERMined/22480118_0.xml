<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the changes in immune mediators profile induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection, we assessed the serum levels of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha), chemokines (MIP-1alpha, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, ENA-78) and growth factors (VEGF, bFGF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients before, during and after surgery and compared the results with those measured for a group of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used XMap profiling technology (Luminex) that allows simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters in small volumes of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and antiinflamatory cytokine IL-10 were elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with respect to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, serum levels of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha positively correlated with the levels of proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During surgery, an increase in serum concentration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> determined mediators was noticed, with positive correlation between TNF-alpha, IL-8, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these correlations were no more noticed one week after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, cytokines levels decreased as compared to those noticed before surgery, but still higher than in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results suggest that both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and surgical act may influence immune mediators' network </plain></SENT>
