<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The evidence on the agreement between self-reported health resource use and administrative records is mixed and no gold standard exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess self-reported general practitioner (GP) and specialist doctor visits, as well as medication use via telephone interview against national insurance administrative data for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a sample of 76 adults recently diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, data was abstracted from telephone survey items on GP visits, specialist visits and medication use over the previous six months and compared with data on the same individuals from administrative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraclass correlation coefficients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) were used to assess the reliability of frequency of visits and kappa statistics were derived for four broad categories of medicines used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947761" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal conditions</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, psychological conditions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was undertaken to assess factors associated with agreement (yes/no) between the two data sources for doctors' visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Good agreement was found for GP visits (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> 0.62, 95%CI: 0.38, 0.86) and specialist visits (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> 0.73, 95%CI: 0.56, 0.91) across the two data sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When costs were assigned to frequencies, mean costs for the two methods were not significantly different over six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over-reporting was more common among men and participants with frequent doctor encounters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large discrepancies between self-reports and administration records were found for broad types of medications used (44% agreement, kappa 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Self-reported frequency of doctor's visits using telephone interviews may be a reasonable substitute for administratively recorded data however, medication use by self-report appears to be unreliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administrative records are preferable to self-report for health service use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors with high and complex service needs </plain></SENT>
