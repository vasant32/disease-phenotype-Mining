<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many studies documented the influence of KRAS mutation status on the response of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The COBAS 4800 KRAS is an assay using real time PCR and TaqMelt technology, CE-IVD validated, for the detection of 19 KRAS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in exons 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared COBAS with previously validated PCR TaqMan and High Resolution Melting (HRM) assays on 156 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA extraction procedures, using the Qiagen QiAMP kit and the Roche COBAS DNA kit, were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 156 samples, 132 were interpretable using COBAS and TaqMan and 92 using COBAS and HRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found between COBAS/TaqMan and COBAS/HRM (k = 0.937; p &lt; 0.001 - four discordant cases were found, mostly concerning codon 61 mutations and k = 0.891; p &lt; 0.001 - five discordant cases were found, three regarding codon 61 and two on codon 12/13, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between the two DNA extraction methods (t = 1.7185; dol = 39; α = 5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three assays were found suitable to detect accurately KRAS mutations in colon FFPE specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>COBAS and TaqMan were found to be more robust than HRM, as they yielded fewer non-interpretable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA extraction kits were found to provide equivalent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that pre-screening using COBAS with further TaqMan mutation characterization constitutes an easy and reliable approach for routine diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
