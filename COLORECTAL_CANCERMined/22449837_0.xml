<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To assess the effects of receiving a research informational pamphlet produced by the federal Office for Human Research Protections on telephone survey participation rates of older Latinos, and illustrate the feasibility of nesting recruitment studies within other funded studies when stand alone funding for recruitment studies is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Latino patients aged ≥50 with ≥1 visit during the preceding year (N=1314) were sampled from three community clinics and a multi-specialty medical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to receive or not receive a pamphlet that contained information on research participation in the initial mailing for the telephone survey study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survey participation rates were compared between the pamphlet and no pamphlet groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a multivariate model, women (OR=1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.8), and those with public insurance (vs. no insurance; OR=1.7; 95% CI 1.1, 2.5) were more likely to participate, while those age 65+ (vs. age 50-54; OR=0.6; 95% CI 0.4, 0.8) were less likely to participate; there was no significant difference by pamphlet group (OR=0.8; 95% CI 0.7, 1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nesting of the randomized trial of the recruitment pamphlet within the funded study required minimal additional resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: Recruitment methods that are more intensive than a pamphlet may be needed to enhance survey participation rates among older Latinos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nesting recruitment trials within funded studies is a promising and efficient approach for testing recruitment strategies </plain></SENT>
