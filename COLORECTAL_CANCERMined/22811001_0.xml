<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Altered microRNAs (miRNAs) expression has been found in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant plasma miRNAs were also found in various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However the alteration of plasma expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this present study, the expression profiles of ten miRNAs, let-7a, miR-21, miR26b, miR-34c, miR-99a, miR-133a, miR-137, miR-184, miR-194a, and miR-375, in plasma from 50 patients and 36 healthy subjects were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that the expression level of miR-21 was significantly up-regulated in plasma samples obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e> patients (p &lt; 0.01) than those from healthy subjects, which were in consistent with our finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 7.7-fold increase of miR-21 in cancerous parts when compared to their non-cancerous counterparts (p &lt; 0.0001) was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression levels of miR-21 and miR-26b were both reduced in post-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e> patients with good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the concentration of plasma miR-21 and miR-26b stayed high after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> removal in the expired cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that detecting circulating miR-21 and miR-26b pre- and post-operatively might provide a novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
