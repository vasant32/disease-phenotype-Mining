<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage II colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), high-risk patient selection is required, but no candidate markers have been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our concern was whether anastomotic leakage (Lk) is a potential available clinicopathological factor for selecting high-risk stage II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred seven patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent curative resection were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables were tested for their relationship to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year disease-free survival rate (DFS) was 87.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The univariable prognostic analyses indicated that Lk (P = 0.003) was the only significant factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariable prognostic analysis revealed that Lk remained to be potently independent [hazard ratio (HR), 4.21, P = 0.021), and the DFS was 58.3% in cases with Lk, while 88.7% in the counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed perioperative blood transfusion (P = 0.001) was independently associated with Lk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, Lk was closely associated with hematogenic recurrence (P = 0.003) rather than peritoneal or local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although sustained increase of the serum C-reactive protein at 2 weeks after operation predicted poor prognosis, the mutitivariable analysis including the C-reactive protein level revealed that Lk still indicated the prognostic potential (HR, 3.70, P = 0.075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings concluded that Lk may be a high risk for systemic recurrence in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
