<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET-CT are two second-line useful imaging modalities to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> local recurrence (LR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anatomical information derived from MRI combined to the functional information provided by diffusion-weighted imaging currently remain of value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pelvic MRI is accurate not only for detection of pelvic colorectal recurrence but also for the prediction of absence of tumoral invasion in pelvic structures, and it may thus provide a preoperative road map of the recurrence to allow for appropriate surgical planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As always, correlation of imaging and clinical findings in the multidisciplinary forum is paramount </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI can also be used to follow-up LR treated with radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to discuss clinical practice and application of MRI in the assessment or pelvic recurrence from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
