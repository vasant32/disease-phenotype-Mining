<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the costs relating to treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between Xelox and Folfox-4 at a regional level according to the clinical experience at an Italian hospital in Lombardy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cost analysis was carried out regarding resource consumption by patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> based on data collected over a 12-month period between 2010 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis involved 40 patients who attended the Department of Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> and Hematology at Carlo Poma Hospital to undergo adjuvant therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A chart was created for each patient containing their medical history, their pharmacological therapy indicating the number and duration of chemotherapy cycles, dose in mg administered for each cycle, number of day hospital visits for each cycle, number of days spent in hospital to position the central vein catheter, type of infusion pump used, any subsequent supportive therapy, and any side effects and outpatient visits connected with side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cost analysis shows the savings involved in using Xelox for a single cycle of treatment, ie, approximately â‚¬1414.00 per patient (53% compared with Folfox-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each single cycle of treatment, the savings generated by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> compared with 5-FU can be attributed mostly to the fact that oral administration of chemotherapy requires fewer resources and does not require use of a central vein catheter (approximately 70% of overall cost) which amply compensates for the higher cost of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> compared with 5-FU-LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensibility analysis confirms the results of the base-case scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate that infusion via a central vein catheter represents a significant cost, and that substitution with an oral therapy, even when associated with drugs administered intravenously, represents a consistent saving of hospital resources </plain></SENT>
