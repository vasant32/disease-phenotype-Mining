<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite clinical practice guidelines to guide surveillance care for those who have completed treatment for this disease as well as screening for first degree relatives of people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the level of uptake of these recommendations remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If outcomes for both patients and their families are to be improved, it is important to establish systematic and cost-effective interventions to improve adherence to guideline recommendations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surveillance and screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial will be used to test the effectiveness of a print-based intervention to improve adherence to colonoscopy surveillance among people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations among their first degree relatives (FDRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>People diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the past 10 months will be recruited through a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consenting participants will be asked if their first degree relatives might also be willing to participate in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Information on family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> will be obtained from patients at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients and their families will be randomized to either minimal ethical care or the print-based intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The print-based intervention for FDRs will be tailored to the participant's level of risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as determined by the self-reported family history assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow up data on surveillance and screening participation will be collected from patients and their FDRs respectively at 12, 24 and 36 months' post recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The primary analyses will relate to comparing levels of guideline adherence in usual care group versus print-based group in the patient sample and the FDR sample respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Results of this study will provide contribute to the evidence base about effective strategies to a) improve adherence to surveillance recommendation for people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; and b) improve adherence to screening recommendation for FDRs of people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry to access the target population may have significant advantages in increasing the reach of the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Registration Number (ACTRN): ACTRN12609000628246 </plain></SENT>
