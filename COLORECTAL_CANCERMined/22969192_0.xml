<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) was the second leading cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality in men (n = 1063, 49.77/100,000), as well as women (n = 803, 34.89/100,000) in Croatia in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Croatian National <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Screening Program was established by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and its implementation started in September, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The coordinators were recruited in each county institute of public health with an obligation to provide fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) to the participants, followed by colonoscopy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FOBT was performed by hypersensitive guaiac-based Hemognost card test (Biognost, Zagreb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The test and short questionnaire were delivered to the home addresses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> citizens aged 50-74 years consecutively during a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each participant was required to complete the questionnaire and send it together with the stool specimen on three test cards back to the institute for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>About 4% FOBT positive cases are expected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> risk populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A descriptive analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,056,694 individuals (born between 1933-1945 and 1952-1957) were invited to screening by the end of September 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In total, 210,239 (19.9%) persons returned the envelope with a completed questionnaire, and 181,102 of them returned it with a correctly placed stool specimen on FOBT cards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Until now, 12,477 (6.9%), FOBT-positive patients have been found, which is at the upper limit of the expected values in European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Screening and Diagnosis [European Union (EU) Guidelines] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was performed in 8541 cases (uptake 66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Screening has identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 472 patients (5.5% of colonoscopied, 3.8% of FOBT-positive, and 0.26% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screened individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is also in the expected range according to EU Guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> were found and removed in 3329 (39% of colonoscopied) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The largest number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were found in the left half of the colon: 64% (19%, 37% and 8% in the rectum, sigma, and descendens, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The other 36% were detected in the proximal part (17% in the transverse colon and 19% in ceco-ascending colon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in the rectum (5-10 mm in diameter), sigmoid and descending colon were histologically found to be tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in 60% of cases, with a low degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 40% were classified as hyperplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> of this size in the transverse or ceco-ascending colon in almost 20% had a histologically villous component, but still had a low degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> sized 10-20 mm in diameter were in 43% cases tubulovillous, and among them, 32% had areas with a high degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, especially those <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in the ceco-ascending or transverse part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the Croatian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Screening National Program in the first 3 years were as follows: relatively low percentage of returned FOBT, higher number of FOBT-positive persons but still in the range for population-based programs, and higher number of pathologic findings (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest a need for intervention strategies that include organizational changes and educational activities to improve awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening usefulness and increase participation rates </plain></SENT>
