<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were downstaging-rate and induction of complete pathological response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with cT3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> (825 mg/sqm twice daily on radiotherapy-days weeks 1-4) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1, 15 and 29) were administered concurrently to pelvic radiotherapy (1.8 Gy daily up to 45 Gy in 5 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery followed 6-8 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A two-stage trial was designed with early termination at eight patients if more than three patients had experienced a common toxicity criteria ≥grade 3 according to the NCI CTC guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first stage eight patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age was 70 years (range 55-76) and ECOG PS 0/1 (%) was 87.5/12.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major side effects were mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002584'>intestinal bleeding</z:hpo> (grade 3, 25%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (grade 3, 25%), perianal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (grades 3 and 4, 25%) followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (grade 3, 12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> downstaging was observed in 37.5% of patients with complete pathological response in two patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After interim analysis of feasibility and tolerability, accrual was terminated according to protocol due to ≥grade 3 toxicities in 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete pathological response was seen in 25% of patients but was accompanied by considerable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further clinical trials are needed to clarify the role of bevacizumab in this setting </plain></SENT>
