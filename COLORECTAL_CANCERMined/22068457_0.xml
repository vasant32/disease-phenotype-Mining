<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dbait molecules are a new class of DNA repair inhibitors triggering false DNA damage signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dbait has already been shown to be effective in combination with radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the adjuvant impact of Dbait on chemotherapy in vitro and in mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed DNA repair efficiency over time, in vitro, in human <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> HT-29 (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS) and HCT-116 (mutated KRAS) cell lines treated with Dbait in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetically engineered mice spontaneously developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> in the intestines were selected for the evaluation of treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dbait delayed the repair of DNA damage induced by chemotherapy in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In APC (+/1638N) mutant mice, the combination of Dbait and chemotherapy decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size more effectively than chemotherapy alone (median size: 3.6 vs. 10.85 mm(2), P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In APC (+/1638N)/KRAS ( V12G ) mutant mice, animals treated with a combination of Dbait and chemotherapy survived significantly longer than animals treated by chemotherapy alone (median survival: 210 vs. 194 days, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A quarter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals treated by chemotherapy alone died as rapidly as untreated animals, whereas the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was delayed by 29 days by the addition of Dbait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No increase in toxicity due to Dbait was observed in either mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of Dbait to inhibit DNA repair may be an effective additional treatment for increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy in colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, independently of KRAS status </plain></SENT>
