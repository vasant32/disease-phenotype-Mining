<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: DNA methylation at the five position of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> is well recognized as an important epigenetic modification in human health and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidences demonstrated that 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) by the TET family of enzymes can be converted to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we use an ultrasensitive and accurate isotope-based LC-MS/MS method to precisely determine the levels of 5-hmC and 5-mC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the C-26 <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Our data showed that 5-hmC content is significantly reduced (approximately sixfold) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as compared with adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the ratio of 5-hmC to 5-mC dropped from 0.054 ± 0.005 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, to 0.011 ± 0.002 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The analysis of 5-hmC levels and the ratio of 5-hmC:5-mC during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> might provide insight into the role of this modification in cellular immortalization and transformation </plain></SENT>
