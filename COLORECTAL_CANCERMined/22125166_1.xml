<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The adverse oncological effect of portal vein embolization (PVE) in patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the effect of PVE on change of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens obtained from sequential hepatectomy before and after PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between December 1996 and April 2009, among 55 patients who achieved two-stage hepatectomy (TSH) combined with PVE, 39 had available <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue blocks from both the first- and second-stage hepatectomy and constituted the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemistry of Ki67 and Bcl-2 before and after PVE was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biomarker expressions and clinicopathological variables were assessed and their impact on recurrence was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume and carcinoembryonic serum level significantly increased after PVE, the expression of Ki67 and Bcl-2 remained similar before and after PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Bcl-2 ratio (expressed as Bcl-2 after PVE over Bcl-2 before PVE) was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (P=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with Bcl-2 ratio â‰¤ 1 had a significantly longer median recurrence-free survival compared with those with Bcl-2 ratio &gt;1 receiving or not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (24.8 months versus 8.9 or 5.8 months, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 ratio may predict early recurrence and identify patients who do not require postoperative chemotherapy in patients undergoing TSH with PVE for CLM </plain></SENT>
