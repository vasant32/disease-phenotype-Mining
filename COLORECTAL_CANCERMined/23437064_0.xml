<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to perform computational analysis to investigate the structural implications of the underlying mutations caused by c.38G&gt;A (p.G13D) on protein conformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to understand the plausible structural and dynamical implications caused by c.35G&gt;A (p.G12D) and c.38G&gt;A (p.G13D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential of mean force (PMF) simulations were carried out to determine the free energy profiles of the binding processes of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> interacting with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) KRAS and its mutants (MT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using MD simulations, we observed that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) increased as a function of time for the MT c.35G&gt;A (p.G12D) and MT c.38G&gt;A (p.G13D) when compared with the WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed that the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding pocket in the c.35G&gt;A (p.G12D) mutant is more open than that of the WT and the c.38G&gt;A (p.G13D) proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, the analysis of atomic fluctuations and free energy profiles revealed that the mutation of c.35G&gt;A (p.G12D) may induce additional fluctuations in the sensitive sites (P-loop, switch I and II regions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such fluctuations may promote instability in these protein regions and hamper <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together with the results obtained from MD and PMF simulations, the present findings implicate fluctuations at the sensitive sites (P-loop, switch I and II regions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings revealed that KRAS mutations in codon 13 have similar behavior as KRAS WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To gain a better insight into why patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) and the KRAS c.38G&gt;A (p.G13D) mutation appear to benefit from anti-EGFR therapy, the role of the KRAS c.38G&gt;A (p.G13D) mutation in mCRC needs to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
