<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A sensitive and selective hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method for the quantification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human plasma ultrafiltrates were precipitated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi> containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> as an internal standard and further diluted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromatographic separation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and the internal standard was achieved with a column modified with phosphorylcholine and an isocratic mobile phase (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi>/water/<z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>=90:10:0.1, v/v/v) at the flow rate of 0.2mL/min </plain></SENT>
