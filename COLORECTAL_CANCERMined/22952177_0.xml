<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Food sources and intakes of zinc and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron may differ between Western and Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the studies on the association between zinc and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intakes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have been conducted in Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between zinc and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intakes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in a Japanese general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We conducted a large, population-based prospective study in 39,721 men and 45,376 women aged 45-74 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">Heme</z:chebi> iron and zinc intakes were measured by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire in either 1995 or 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During as many as 808,053 person-years of follow-up until the end of 2006, 1284 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate-adjusted models, zinc and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intakes were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in either men or women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the lowest quartile, the HRs (95% CIs) for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the fourth quartile of zinc and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intakes were 0.77 (0.58, 1.03; P-trend = 0.2) and 1.06 (0.79, 1.42; P-trend = 0.6), respectively, for men and 1.05 (0.77, 1.44; P-trend = 0.4) and 0.88 (0.61, 1.29; P-trend = 0.4), respectively, for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results in a Japanese population with lower intakes and different major food sources of zinc and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron in comparison with those of Western populations suggest that zinc and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intakes are not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
