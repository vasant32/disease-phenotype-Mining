<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We retrospectively investigated the impact of prior abdominal surgery on the outcome of laparoscopic colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Among 607 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery, 192 patients had previously undergone abdominal surgery (S group) and 415 had not (non-S group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of female patients was higher in the S group than in the non-S group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of conversion to open surgery was higher in the S group (5.2%, 10/192) than in the non-S group (2.6%, 11/415), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the mean operating time and estimated blood loss were similar in the two groups, right and transverse colectomy after prior gastrectomy and ipsilateral colectomy after prior colectomy took longer and were associated with greater blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The morbidity rates of the two groups were similar (S group: 15.6%, 30/192; non-S group: 14.5%, 60/415) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 5 intraoperative small-bowel injuries or postoperative small-bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> in the S group, especially in the patients with prior gastrointestinal-tract surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that there is no reason to avoid laparoscopic procedures in most patients with prior abdominal surgery despite a higher conversion rate, but caution is warranted in patients who have undergone major gastrointestinal-tract surgery </plain></SENT>
