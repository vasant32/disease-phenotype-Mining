<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Sixty-two consecutive specimens from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resected between February 2009 and April 2010 were randomized to the stained group or the control unstained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in the retrieval, number and size of nodes, and time for retrieval were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> harvest differed significantly with 30±12 and 13±5 (p&lt;0.01) nodes in the stained and the control groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insufficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> harvest (less than 12 nodes) occurred in 14 cases of the control group and only in 1 case of the stained group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">Metastases</z:e> were confirmed in 57 LNs occurring in 17 cases of the stained group and in 39 nodes occurring in 15 cases of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> retrieval in the stained and control groups were comparable, 27.6±6.9min and 24.7±6.0min (p&gt;0.05), respectively, yet there was a significant difference in the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> (&lt;2mm) (294 vs. 59, respectively, p&lt;0.01) as well as in the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> 2-5mm in size (474 vs. 220, respectively, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By lymphatic staining method, more and smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> could be detected, which significantly improved the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> harvest of resected colorectal specimens and reduced cases of insufficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> harvest </plain></SENT>
