<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed computerized record linkage among three different Lombardy health care databases: File F registry, Regional discharge database, and Registry Office records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into approved and off-label uses according to the AIFA indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with bevacizumab was administered to 780 patients, of whom 81.7% (n = 637) had mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these, 37.8% (n = 241) of patients received the drug in observance of AIFA indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, âˆ¼10% of patients had serious treatment-related toxicities (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, 3.5%; venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, 2.8%; <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, 1.9%; intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, &lt;1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 1-year survival rate was 74.3% and the 2-year survival rate was 39.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 20.5 months, and there were no meaningful differences between gender and age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a gap between the bevacizumab approved indication and clinical practice pattern: overall, less than one half of the patients received bevacizumab in observance with the regulatory indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main reason for nonadherence to the indication was use as a second-line or advanced line of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of serious adverse events and the survival rates of mCRC patients were similar to those reported in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
