<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Management of patients with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (SLM) is complex and the surgical decision process should be based on a comprehensive oncological strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to compare outcome of single-center management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and resectable SLM to those of referred patients for liver resection only after removal of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> (PT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2000 and 2007, 47 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and SLM underwent resection of both the PT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> under our care (unicentric) and 32 were referred after resection of their PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two groups were comparable for demographics, PT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In unicentric group, 23% received upfront chemotherapy with the PT in place, 53% had a combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and SLM resection, 11% had a two-stage hepatectomy with resection of the primary during the first stage and 36% underwent delayed hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of surgical interventions, the delay between diagnosis and liver resection (9 vs. 5 months, P &lt; 0.001), the median number of cycles of chemotherapy before hepatectomy (12 vs. 6 months, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in the referred group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative morbidity was significantly higher in the referred group (75 vs. 47%, P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 43 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OS and DFS were not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the survival benefit is not proven, single-center management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and resectable SLM reduces the number of interventions, the number of cycles of chemotherapy and postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
