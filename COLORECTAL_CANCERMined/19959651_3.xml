<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the role of neighbourhood factors in these disparities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 4748 Black and White patients from the Georgia Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry were diagnosed with stages III colon and II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> between 2000 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neighbourhood poverty, segregation (% Black residents) and rurality were linked to each patient using census tract identifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multilevel analyses explored the role of neighbourhood characteristics and the nested association of patient race within categories of neighbourhoods in receipt of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Odds of receiving chemotherapy for urban and suburban patients were 38% (95% CI 1.09 to 1.74) and 53% (95% CI 1.20 to 1.94) higher than for rural patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, odds of receiving chemotherapy for urban Black patients were 24% (95% CI 0.62 to 0.94) lower than for their White counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receipt of chemotherapy did not significantly differ between Blacks and Whites residing in suburban or rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Black-White disparities in receipt of chemotherapy among Georgia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were confined to urban patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disparities in receipt of this treatment for rural patients were found irrespective of patient race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight geographic areas where targeted interventions might be needed </plain></SENT>
