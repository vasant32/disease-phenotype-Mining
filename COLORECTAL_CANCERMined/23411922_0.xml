<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microsatellites are considered phenotypic markers of prognosis, therapeutic response and identify patients with mutations in DNA repair genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the molecular profile of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> underwent to transanal endoscopic microsurgery-TEM in surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty eight surgical specimens were evaluated according to pathological staging and the region of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were dissected and submitted to DNA extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> were tested for microsatellite instability-MSI using a panel of five markers (BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S2720) technique of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: From total 63% were male and 47% female, with mean age of 58.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were 58%, 24% low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 76% high grade; 42% were <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The depth of resection 80% included the rectal perirenal fat and 20% the muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent microsatellite amplification was BAT26 (100%) and lowest D17S2720 (85.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (42%) were MSI, ten were <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, two low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and four high grade </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The allelic loss of microsatellite markers was statistically significant in cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in relation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most frequent microsatellite amplification was BAT26 (100%) and lower D17S2720 (85.4%), 16 patients (42%) had microsatellite instability-MSI thereof ten were <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, two low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, four high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 22 cases (58%) were microsatellite stable-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Microsatellite instability (MSI-H) was significantly associated with rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, confirming its use as a prognostic marker in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
