<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate chemotherapy-associated adverse events among elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients treated in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on elderly patients aged ≥65 years diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at any stage between 2003 and 2005 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 46 692 patients assessed, 36 137 (77.4%) received no i.v. chemotherapy, 5472 (11.7%) received fluorouracil (5-FU) alone, 2284 (4.9%) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing regimens, 1306 (2.8%) received bevacizumab-containing regimens but without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and 1493 (3.2%) received other chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and laboratory test abnormalities were commonly found in elderly, even in those who had not received any i.v. chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of i.v. chemotherapy was associated with higher incidences of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based regimens led to higher incidences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> compared with 5-FU alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients aged ≥70 years (n = 37 601, 80.5%) tended to experience higher rates of certain adverse events, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> than patients aged 65-69 years (n = 9091, 19.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among community-dwelling elderly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the addition of i.v. chemotherapy and advanced age were associated with increasing adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Appropriate selection of patients and assessment of social support may be important </plain></SENT>
