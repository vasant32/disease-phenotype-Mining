<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 324 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HDRAs were performed using seven combinations of anticancer drugs, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> with leucovorin (FL), FL with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX), irinotecan (FOLFIRI), and their combinations with bevacizumab and cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 324 HDRA results, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> inhibition rates of regimes using FOLFOX (34.2-39.2%) were higher than those using FOLFIRI (24.2-32.7%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of 86 evaluated chemotherapeutic regimes, the correlation rate of HDRA to the clinical effect of chemotherapy was calculated to be 66.3% (57/86), with a 72.7% (40/55) sensitivity and a 54.7% (17/31) specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HDRA might be a feasible and useful technique for predicting therapy efficacy and selecting the appropriate anticancer regime for individual patients, notwithstanding its low accuracy </plain></SENT>
