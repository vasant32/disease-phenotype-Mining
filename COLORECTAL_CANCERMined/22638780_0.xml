<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reported risk factors for LNM in completely resected T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are deep submucosal invasion, grade 3, angiolymphatic invasion, and budding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to identify the histopathologic factors associated with LNM in T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 435 patients with T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated by endoscopic or surgical resection between January 2001 and April 2010 at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center, Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 435 patients were classified into two groups - those undergoing surgical resection (n = 324) and those undergoing endoscopic resection (n = 111) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the surgically resected group, details regarding depth of submucosal invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade, budding, and background <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (BGA) were evaluated with respect to presence or absence of LNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the endoscopically resected group, the results of follow-ups and additional salvage surgeries were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the surgically resected group, LNM was detected in 42 patients (13.0 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3, angiolymphatic invasion, budding, and the absence of BGA were identified as factors associated with LNM in univariate and multivariate analyses (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 50 patients in the endoscopically resected group with high risk, three were diagnosed as being LNM-positive during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no LNM in the endoscopically resected group with low risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Grade 3, angiolymphatic invasion, budding, and the absence of BGA are the risk factors that predict LNM in patients with T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In cases where endoscopically resected T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has no risk factor, cautious follow-up could be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, if the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> has any risk factor, additional surgical resection should be considered </plain></SENT>
