<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of combined B-vitamin treatment on the occurrence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Women's <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">Folic Acid</z:chebi> Cardiovascular Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5442 female health professionals at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> from April 1998 through July 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to receive a combination pill of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (2.5mg), vitamin B(6) (50mg), and vitamin B(12) (1mg) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study included 1470 participants who were followed up for as long as 9.2 years and underwent an endoscopy at any point during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We estimated relative risks using a generalized linear model with a natural logarithm link function and Poisson distributed errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was similar among participants receiving treatment (24.3%, 180 of 741 participants) vs placebo (24.0%, 175 of 729 participants) (multivariable adjusted relative risk = 1.00, 95% confidence interval = 0.83 to 1.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment was not associated with the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> when data were analyzed by subsite, size, stage, and the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant effect modification by alcohol intake, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, or baseline plasma levels or intakes of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, vitamin B(6), or vitamin B(12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate no statistically significant effect of combined <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, vitamin B(6), and vitamin B(12) treatment on colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> among women at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
