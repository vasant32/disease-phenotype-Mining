<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Novel predictive markers are required to further improve the selection of patients for this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the influence of modification of KRAS by gene copy number aberration (CNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs) in correlation to clinical outcome in mCRC patients treated with cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> tissue was used from 34 mCRC patients in a phase III trial, who were selected based upon their good (n = 17) or poor (n = 17) progression-free survival (PFS) upon treatment with cetuximab in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene copy number at the KRAS locus was assessed using high resolution genome-wide array CGH and the expression levels of 17 miRNAs targeting KRAS were determined by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Copy number loss of the KRAS locus was observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> of 5 patients who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> good responders including patients with a KRAS mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Copy number gains in two <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were associated with a poor PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In KRAS mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> increased miR-200b and decreased miR-143 expression were associated with a good PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS patients, miRNA expression did not correlate with PFS in a multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the assessment of KRAS CNA and miRNAs targeting KRAS might further optimize the selection of mCRC eligible for anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
