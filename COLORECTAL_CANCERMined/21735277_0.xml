<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Written surveys were completed by 480 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors and 366 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors diagnosed between 1999 and 2008 at a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center in the Minneapolis, MN, area (81% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses were compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors and 65% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors were unable to identify their stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors and 21% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors in whom regional nodes were examined did not know whether they had positive nodes </plain></SENT>
