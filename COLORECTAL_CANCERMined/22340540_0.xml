<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> multidisciplinary team (MDT) working model is recommended by UK and other countries, but there is little information on the impact of MDT working on management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the effect on management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after the inception of an MDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 595 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were referred to the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, the pre-MDT cohort include 297 patients, recruited from January 1999 to November 2002, and the MDT cohort had 298 patients enrolled from December 2002 to September 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information recorded included: TNM stage from histological reports, degree of differentiation, the number of examined lymph nodes and CT TNM staging performed or not, and its accuracy, including local and distant recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of examined lymph nodes and the accuracy of TNM staging by CT in the MDT group were significantly more than those in pre-MDT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT TNM staging was more accurate in the MDT group compared to the pre-MDT group (P = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence in the MDT group was lower than pre-MDT group (log-rank test, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that age (P = 0.001), management after inception of the MDT (P = 0.002), degree of differentiation (P = 0.003), number of examined lymph nodes (P = 0.002), and TNM stage (P = 0.000) were important factors that independently influence overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The inception of MDT working improved the diagnostic accuracy and overall survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MDT working promoted communication and cooperation between disciplines and ensured high-quality diagnosis, evidence-based decision making, and optimal treatment planning </plain></SENT>
