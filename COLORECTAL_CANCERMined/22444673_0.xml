<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">Fluorine-18</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT scans were performed on 33 patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> before any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SUVmax of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and the clinicopathologic data associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic metastases</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 1 (GLUT1), HGF, c-Met, VEGF-C, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues was analyzed using immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphatic endothelial cells were marked with D2-40, and lymphatic vessel density (LVD) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlations were analyzed among the SUVmax of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, LVD, and the expression of GLUT1, HGF, c-Met, VEGF-C, and VEGFR-3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SUVmax and LVD in 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic metastases</z:e> were 13.00 ± 4.51 and 6.25 ± 1.54, respectively, whereas in 18 patients with nonmetastatic nodes, SUVmax and LVD were 9.66 ± 4.82 and 4.54 ± 1.02, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences of SUVmax and LVD between metastatic and nonmetastatic patients were statistically significant (F = 4.153, P = .025, and F = 14.501, P = .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences of SUVmax and LVD in variably differentiated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (F = 0.708, P = .502, and F = 0.311, P = .735, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression rates of GLUT1 in neoplastic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue were 72.7% (24 of 33) and 21.2% (seven of 33), respectively (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expression rates of GLUT1 in metastatic and nonmetastatic tissue were 93.33% (14 of 15) and 61.11% (11 of 18), respectively (P = .038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LVD and the integrated optical density of GLUT1 were 5.31 ± 1.53 and 8.21 × 10(4) ± 4.30 × 10(4), respectively, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue, and there were linear correlations between SUVmax and LVD (r = 0.373, P = .033) and between SUVmax and expression of GLUT1 (r = 0.428, P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The differences of SUVmax in HGF, c-Met, and VEGF-C groups with different expressions were statistically significant (P = .007, P = .009, and P = .030, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The expression of GLUT1 and HGF as well as of GLUT1 and VEGF-C was rank correlated (r = 0.521, P = .002, and r = 0.505, P = .003, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The SUVmax of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was significantly higher in metastatic patients; the uptake of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was associated with LVD and the expression of HGF and VEGF-C but not with the expression of VEGFR-3 </plain></SENT>
