<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the molecular pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (UC-CRN), we studied the frequency of microsatellite instability (MSI) and mutations in p53, BRAF and KRAS genes in the tissues of patients with long standing UC with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and compared them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients without risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (S-CRN) in an area with lower prevalence for either disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies were obtained during magnifying chromo colonoscopy or routine colonoscopy in consecutive UC patients with high risk (UC-HR) and low risk (UC-LR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and those with S-CRN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MSI (NCI-Bethesda panel) and mutations in p53, KRAS and BRAF genes were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with UC-HR, 30 with UC-LR and 30 with S-CRN were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six (21.4%) of UC-HR had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (Progressors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSI was not detected in the UC-CRN group as compared to 5 (16.7%) in the S-CRN group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p53 mutations occurred in 1 (3.3%) of UC-LR, increasing to 6 (27.3%, P&lt;0.05) and 3 (50%, P&lt;0.05) in the UC-HR subgroups without and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> respectively, as against 10 (33.3%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were found only in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None showed the BRAF mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a population with a lower prevalence for UC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the molecular pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is comparable to that reported from areas with a higher prevalence of these diseases, MSI being an exception </plain></SENT>
