<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between RAGE and AGE in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> needs to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Levels of RAGE and AGE were examined in azoxymethane (AOM)-injected Fischer 344 rats fed a control diet (Group C), a 15 % <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> (LA) diet (Group L), a control diet with 10 % <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> drink (Group G), and a 15 % LA diet with 10 % <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> drink (Group L + G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group L + G showed the most pronounced increase of body weight, blood sugar, and serum insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rats in Group L + G showed the most pronounced multiplicity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> with increased mucosal RAGE and AGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IEC6 rat intestinal epithelial cells treated with AGE showed increased RAGE expression, which was inhibited by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the AOM-injected rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> model, the levels of RAGE and AGE, and the multiplicity of ACF and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, in Group L + G rats were suppressed by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AGE-RAGE induced by high-LA and high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> diets substantially enhances <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> development; thus, suppression of AGE-RAGE could be a potential target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> chemoprevention </plain></SENT>
