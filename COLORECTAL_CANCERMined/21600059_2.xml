<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening is a primary method to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, yet screening remains low in the U.S. and particularly in Appalachian Pennsylvania, a largely rural area with high rates of poverty, limited health care access, and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Receiving a physician recommendation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is a primary predictor for patient adherence with screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One strategy to disseminate practice-oriented interventions is academic detailing (AD), a method that transfers knowledge or methods to physicians, nurses or office staff through the visit(s) of a trained educator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine acceptability and feasibility of AD among primary care practices in rural Appalachian Pennsylvania to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multi-site, practice-based, intervention study with pre- and 6-month post-intervention review of randomly selected medical records, pre- and post-intervention surveys, as well as a post-intervention key informant interview was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the proportion of patients current with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations and having received a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening within the past year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four practices received three separate AD visits to review four different learning modules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We reviewed 323 records pre-intervention and 301 post-intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of being current with screening recommendation was 56% in the pre-intervention, and 60% in the post-intervention (p=0.29), while the prevalence of having been screened in the past year increased from 17% to 35% (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopies were the most frequently performed screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Provider knowledge was improved and AD was reported to be an acceptable intervention for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> performance improvement by the practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AD appears to be acceptable and feasible for primary care providers in rural Appalachia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A ceiling effect for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening may have been a factor in no change in overall screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While the study was not designed to test the efficacy of AD on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates, our evidence suggests that AD is acceptable and may be efficacious in increasing recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates in Appalachian practices which could be tested through a randomized controlled study </plain></SENT>
