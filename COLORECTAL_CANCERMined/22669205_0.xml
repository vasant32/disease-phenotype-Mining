<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Malaysia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is the second most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in women and ranked first in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyze the mutations in genes involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> including MLH1, MSH2, KRAS, and APC genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 76 patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography for the detection of mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) and APC genes and the PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism for screening of the KRAS gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 17 types of missense mutations in 38 out of 76 patients in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine mutations were identified in the APC gene, five mutations were detected in the KRAS gene, and two mutations were identified in the MSH2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one mutation was identified in MLH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Out of these 17 mutations, eight mutations (47 %) were predicted to be pathogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were identified with multiple mutations (3: MSH2 and KRAS, 1: KRAS and APC, 1: MLH1 and APC, 2: APC and APC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have established the PCR-DHPLC and PCR-SSCP for screening of mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study has given a snapshot of the spectrum of mutations in the four genes that were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening in patients and their family members will help in the early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and hence will reduce mortality due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
