<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: DNA methyltransferase-3B (DNMT3B) plays an important role in the generation of aberrant methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of the DNMT3B gene may influence DNMT3B enzyme activity on DNA methylation, thereby modulating the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The polymorphisms in the promoter region of the DNMT3B gene [-149C&gt;T (rs2424913) and -579G&gt;T (rs1569686)] were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and a total of 544 CRC patients and 533 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that the -579G allele was associated with a significantly decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (adjusted OR, 0.50; 95%CI, 0.35-0.72; P = 0.0002) when compared with the -579TT genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the DNMT3B-149CT genotype was not associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (adjusted OR, 0.48; 95%CI, 0.18-1.30; P = 0.151) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, stratification analysis revealed that the increased risk was predominant in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> showing no effect of primary occurrence site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our research demonstrated the -579G allele was a potential protective factor for the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
