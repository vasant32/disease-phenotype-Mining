<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 67 patients with pathologic TNM stage II, III, and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TYMS and ERCC1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was determined using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chemosensitivity was examined using an ATP-based chemotherapy response assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high response was defined as a response producing ≥40% reduction in ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean level of TYMS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the groups with low and high response to 5-FU was 2.35×10(-3) ± 2.16×10(-3) 2(-(ΔCt)) and 4.54×10(-3) ± 2.46×10(-3) 2(-(ΔCt)), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean level of ERCC1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the groups with low and high response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was 13.92×10(-3) ± 9.90×10(-3) 2(-(ΔCt)) and 23.59×10(-3) ± 5.88×10(-3) 2(-(ΔCt)), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Groups with high response to 5-FU and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> had significantly higher expression of TYMS and ERCC1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, respectively (p&lt;0.01 and p=0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High expression of TYMS and ERCC1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was associated with better in vitro chemosensitivity to 5-FU and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, respectively, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
