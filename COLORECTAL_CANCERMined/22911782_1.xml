<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this therapy is poorly effective or ineffective in unselected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes have recently emerged as the best predictive factors of low/absent response to EGFR-targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the need for efficacious treatment options for mCRC patients bearing these mutations, in this short report we examined the antitumoral activity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> gabexate mesilate, alone and in combination with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab, in a panel of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines harbouring a different expression pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>/mutated KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results obtained showed that gabexate mesilate significantly inhibited the growth, invasive potential and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells employed in this study (including those ones harbouring dual KRAS/PIK3CA or BRAF/PIK3CA mutation), while cetuximab affected these parameters only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells with KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, the antitumoral efficacy of gabexate mesilate and cetuximab in combination was found to be not superior than that observed with gabexate mesilate as single agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that gabexate mesilate could represent a promising therapeutic option for mCRC patients, particularly for those harbouring KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, either as mono-therapy or in addition to standard chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies to better elucidate gabexate mesilate mechanism of action in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells are therefore warranted </plain></SENT>
