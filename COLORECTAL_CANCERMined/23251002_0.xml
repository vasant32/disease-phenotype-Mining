<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Vemurafenib, a selective inhibitor of BRAF(V600), has shown significant activity in BRAF(V600) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> but not in less than 10% of metastatic BRAF(V600) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), suggesting that studies of the unique hypermethylated phenotype and concurrent oncogenic activation of BRAF(mut) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may provide combinatorial strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted comparative proteomic analysis of BRAF(V600E) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, followed by correlation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation and sensitivity to the vemurafenib analogue PLX4720 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA were used in combination with PLX4720 to inhibit PI3K and methyltransferase in cell lines and murine models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> lines show higher levels of PI3K/AKT pathway activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines with mutations in PTEN or PIK3CA were less sensitive to growth inhibition by PLX4720 (P = 0.03), and knockdown of PTEN expression in sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells reduced growth inhibition by the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment of PLX4720 with PI3K inhibitors caused synergistic growth inhibition in BRAF-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells with both primary and secondary resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, methyltransferase inhibition was synergistic with PLX4720 and decreased AKT activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, PLX4720 combined with either inhibitors of AKT or methyltransferase showed greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibition than PLX4720 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clones with acquired resistance to PLX4720 in vitro showed PI3K/AKT activation with EGF receptor (EGFR) or KRAS amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is a mechanism of both innate and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BRAF(V600E) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and suggest combinatorial approaches to improve outcomes in this poor prognosis subset of patients </plain></SENT>
