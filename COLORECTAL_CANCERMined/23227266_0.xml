<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> express a constitutively active KRAS protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant fraction of patients show both abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that simultaneous down-regulation of both β-catenin and KRAS was necessary to induce significant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although attractive, an RNAi-based therapeutic approach is still far from being employed in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to recapitulate our previous findings by the use of small-molecule inhibitors of β-catenin and KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show here that the β-catenin inhibitors PKF115-584 and pyrvinium pamoate block β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity and synergize with the KRAS inhibitor S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS, salirasib) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells driven by Wnt and KRAS oncogenic signals, but not in cells carrying BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined use of these compounds was superior to the use of any drug alone in inducing cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath>, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MYC and survivin down-modulation, and inhibition of anchorage-independent growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis of selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-relevant genes revealed down-regulation of CD44 as a common response to the combined treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data provide a proof of principle for a combination therapeutic strategy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
