<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: using case-control study, subjects with age less than 50 years were collected from teaching hospital Makassar between 2008-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frozen or routinely processed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples biopsy and peripheral blood were obtained from 35 CRC patients undergoing surgery and endoscopic examination with 61 subject as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were diagnosis by clinical examination and confirm by histopathology without familial aggregation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA resequencing was conducted for the 3 kb genomic DNA region MGST1 using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: from 96 subject, two varian single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 16454T&gt;G and 16416G&gt;A MGST1 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> association (p= 0.047) was detected in GG genotipe SNP 16454T&gt;G MGST1 with 3.5 fold risk (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.962-13.191) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the results suggest that MGST1 gene polymorphisms as one of environment gene may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in younger age (&lt;50 years old) </plain></SENT>
