<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend tattooing of suspicious-looking lesions at colonoscopy without a reference to the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the endoscopist has to make a judgement as to which lesion may be malignant and require future localisation based on the appearance and size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size and invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> so as to inform tattooing practice for patients taking part in the national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> screening programme (BCSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of BCSP patients who had undergone a polypectomy between October 2008 and October 2010 were collected from a prospectively maintained hospital endoscopic database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histology data were obtained from electronic patient records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 165 patients had undergone 269 polypectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 66 years and 66 % were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size was 10.7 mm (SD = ± 8 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologically, 81 % were neoplastic with 95 % showing low-grade and 5 % high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were found to have invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> within their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> within a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> was 0.7 % (1/143) when the endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size was &lt;10 mm; the risk increased to 2.4 % (2/83) when the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size was 10-19 mm and 13 % (5/40) when the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> was &gt;20 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This trend was statistically significant (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>About 23 % of the patients had the site of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> tattooed; the mean size of the tattooed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was 21 mm (range = 15-50 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Consequently, 25 % of malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and 63 % of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were not tattooed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> among BCSP patients increases significantly when the endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size is ≥ 10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We recommend that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥ 10 mm be tattooed </plain></SENT>
