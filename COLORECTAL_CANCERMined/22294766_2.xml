<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of chemotherapy to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is limited by the inter-individual variability in drug response and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play a crucial role in the development of resistance by the efflux of anticancer agents outside of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore transcript levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human ABCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and non-neoplastic control tissues from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients collected before the first line of treatment by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU)-containing regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognostic potential of ABCs was evaluated by the correlation of transcript levels with clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relations between transcript levels of ABCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and chemotherapy efficacy were also addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transcript profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known human ABCs was assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with a relative standard curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the studied ABCs were down-regulated or unchanged between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ABCA12, ABCA13, ABCB6, ABCC1, ABCC2 and ABCE1 were up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> versus control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transcript levels of ABCA12, ABCC7 and ABCC8 increased in direction from colon to rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, transcript levels of ABCB9, ABCB11, ABCG5 and ABCG8 followed the reverse significant trend, i.e. a decrease in direction from colon to rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The transcript level of ABCC10 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> correlated with the grade (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transcript levels of ABCC6, ABCC11, ABCF1 and ABCF2 were significantly lower in non-responders to palliative chemotherapy in comparison with responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The disease-free interval of patients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly shorter in patients with low transcript levels of ABCA7, ABCA13, ABCB4, ABCC11 and ABCD4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ABCC11 may be a promising candidate marker for a validation study on 5-FU therapy outcome </plain></SENT>
