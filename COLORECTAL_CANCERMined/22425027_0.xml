<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the UK <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> guaiac faecal occult blood test screening pilot studies on incidence trends, stage distribution and mortality trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Ecological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Scotland and the West Midlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DATA: We extracted anonymised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 C18-C20) registration (1982-2006) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> records (1982-2007), along with corresponding mid-year population estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Residents of the screening pilot areas, in the age group 50-69 years, were offered biennial guaiac faecal occult blood test screening from 2000 onwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening was not offered routinely in non-pilot areas until the start of the roll-out of the national screening programmes in England and in Scotland in 2006 and 2007, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We analysed trends in age-specific incidence and mortality rates, and Dukes' stage distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within each country/region, we compared the screening pilot areas to non-screening pilot ('control') areas using Chi square tests and Poisson regression modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following the start of the screening pilots, as expected in the prevalent round of a new screening programme, in the pilot areas there was a short-lived increase in incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among 50-69 year olds except for females in the West Midlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A trend towards earlier stage and less advanced disease was also observed, with males showing significant increases in Dukes' A and corresponding decreases in Dukes' C in the screening pilot areas (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the exception of females in the West Midlands, mortality rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> decreased significantly and at a faster rate in the populations invited for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The existence of a natural control population not yet invited for screening provided a unique opportunity to assess whether the benefits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, beyond the setting of a randomised controlled trial, could be detected using routinely collected statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our analysis suggests that screening will fulfil its aim of reducing mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
