<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the relationship of miR-21 and miR-143 expression to the prognostic/clinicopathological features of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The estimation was performed in 46 paired (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and control) tissue samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, we studied 30 tissue samples of CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MiR-21 and miR-143 expressions were quantified by using the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relation of miR-21 and miR-143 expression to disease-free interval (DFI) (Wilcoxon; P = 0.0026 and P = 0.0191, respectively) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was shorter DFI in patients with a higher expression of miR-21 and, surprisingly, also in patients with a higher expression of miR-143, which is a putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a higher expression of miR-21 and lower expression of miR-143 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue in comparison with adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue (P &lt; 0.0001; P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, we observed a higher expression of miR-21 and a lower expression of miR-143 in CLM in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue (P &lt; 0.0001; P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results support the hypothesis about oncogenic function of miR-21 and show its relation to DFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of miR-143 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> seems to be more complex </plain></SENT>
