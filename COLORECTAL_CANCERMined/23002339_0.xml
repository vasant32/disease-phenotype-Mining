<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray was performed to detect the expression of RRM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines were cultured and three human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, i.e., HCT116, SW480 and SW620, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed to determine the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels of RRM2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was evaluated by double staining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-conjugated Annexin V and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) using Annexin V/PI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The motility and invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells were assessed by the Transwell chamber assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cells were irradiated with a 254 nm UV-C lamp to detect the UV sensitivity after RRM2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining revealed elevated RRM2 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RRM2 overexpression was positively correlated with invasion depth (P &lt; 0.05), poorly differentiated type (P = 0.0051), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> stage (P = 0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of RRM2 in HCT116 cells was downregulated after transfection, and HCT116 cell proliferation was obviously suppressed compared to control groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the invasion test, the number of cells that passed through the chambers in the RRM2-siRNA group was 81 ± 3, which was lower than that in the negative control (289 ± 7) and blank control groups (301 ± 7.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These differences were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that RRM2 overexpression may be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RRM2 silencing by siRNA may inhibit the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and invasiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, suggesting that RRM2 may play an important role in the infiltration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which is a potential therapeutic strategy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, RRM2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> increased UV sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that RRM2 may be a facilitating factor in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and UV-induced DNA damage repair </plain></SENT>
