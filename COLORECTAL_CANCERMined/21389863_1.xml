<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A growing number of patients potentially targeted by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programs are on oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-dose aspirin therapy, mainly for primary or secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims at evaluating whether the use of these medications may impact on the diagnostic performances of i-FOBT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> i-FOBT-positive patients on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-dose aspirin therapy recorded in a regional mass screening program database were enrolled as cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control groups were derived from the same database and included drug-naive i-FOBT-positive patients, matched in a ratio of 1 : 2 for age (Â± 3 years of age), sex, date of colonoscopy, and practice site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information about the use of medications was collected by cross-checking patients' interview before colonoscopy and data recorded in the provincial electronic registry of medical prescriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of i-FOBT for significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) was calculated in the case and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a 2-year study period, 2376 patients were recorded in the regional database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 53 (2%) were on anticoagulation (control group of 106 patients) and 172 (6.6%) were on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-dose aspirin treatment (control group of 344 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was detected in 15 (28.3%) patients on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and in 37 (34.9%) corresponding controls (P=0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was detected in 50 (29.1%) patients on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-dose aspirin and in 107 (31.1%) corresponding controls (P=0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The positive predictive value of i-FOBT for significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is not affected by ongoing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-dose aspirin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that there is no need to interrupt these treatments before i-FOBT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
