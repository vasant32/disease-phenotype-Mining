<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We examined if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EORTC) QLQ-C30 are affected by the specific time point, before or during treatment, at which the questionnaire is completed, and whether this could bias the overall treatment comparison analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 'completion-time window' variable was created on three closed EORTC randomised control trials in lung (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) to indicate when the QLQ-30 was completed relative to chemotherapy cycle dates, defined as 'before', 'on' and 'after' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HRQoL mean scores were calculated using a linear mixed model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) were observed on 6 and 5 scales for 'on' and 'after' comparisons in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> and two-group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> trial, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As for the three-group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> trial, several statistical differences were observed in the 'before' to 'on' and the 'on' to 'after' comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three trials, including the 'completion-time window' variable in the model resulted in a better fit, but no substantial changes in the treatment effects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We showed that considering the exact timing of completion within specified windows resulted in statistical and potentially clinically significant differences, but it did not alter the conclusions of treatment comparison in these studies </plain></SENT>
