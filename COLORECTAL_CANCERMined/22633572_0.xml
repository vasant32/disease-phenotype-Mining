<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The significance of complete calcification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> on imaging is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine whether complete calcification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> after chemotherapy, as assessed by imaging, was synonymous with sterilization of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Imaging by triphasic contrast-enhanced helical CT scan and abdominal ultrasound showed complete calcification of eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in four patients after systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight completely calcified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were resected within four weeks of imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological and surgical findings were analyzed to see whether there was any correlation between radiological and pathological status for completely calcified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pretreatment median diameter at initial imaging of the eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> that became completely calcified after chemotherapy was 24 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight resected calcified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, pathological examination showed the presence of residual viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was occupied by calcification, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>; but small discrete islands of viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were detected at the periphery of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows that although imaging evidence of complete calcification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> may be a good indicator of chemotherapy response, it does not imply sterilization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
