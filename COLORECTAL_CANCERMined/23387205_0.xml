<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples, 38 samples of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, 78 samples of single primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 19 samples of multiple primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (7 synchronous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and 12 metachronous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) collected in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the analysis of clinico-pathologic features for each patient, exon 5-8 of P53 gene and codon 12-13 of K-ras gene of each sample were extended by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multi-factor correlation analysis was carried out between the clinicopathologic features and the mutation of P53 and K-ras gene in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The P53 gene mutation is 0% (0/25),44.8%(17/38), 43.6% (34/78) and 42.1% (8/19) respectively in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa tissue, colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, single lesion and multiple lesion of primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, while the proportion of K-ras gene mutation was 0% (0/25), 18.4%(7/38), 39.7% (31/78), 47.4% (9/19) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our investigation there were obvious statistical differences as to the proportion of mutation of the P53 and K-ras gene between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa tissue and other three groups respectively (P&lt;0.05), while statistical differences as to the proportion of mutation of K-ras gene were found between colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> group and single or multiple colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was significant statistical difference between P53 and K-ras gene mutation in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were no statistical differences as to the proportion of mutation of the P53 and K-ras gene between the stage I , II and well-differentiated ones of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and the stageIII IV and poorly-differentiated ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the age, gender, family history and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> locations of the patients and the mutation of the P53 and K-ras gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The stage and grade of differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was not the risky factor of the mutation of the P53 and K-ras gene in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: results of this study not only suggest that mutation of P53 suppressor gene and K-ras play a significant role in the procedure of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, but also indicate that the mutation of P53 gene occurs earlier than K-ras mutation does during <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
