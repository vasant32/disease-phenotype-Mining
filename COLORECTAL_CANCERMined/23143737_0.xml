<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and colonoscopy can be technically challenging in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed (with little supporting data) that prone positioning of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients might facilitate a difficult colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to determine if starting colonoscopy in the prone position for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients decreases cecal intubation times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized study conducted at the North Texas VA Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a body mass index of ≥30 kg/m(2) undergoing elective colonoscopy were randomized 1:1 to either initial prone positioning or standard, left-lateral positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome measurements were cecal intubation time, frequency of repositioning, sedative medications used, reports of pain, complications, and procedure tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients were randomized to have colonoscopy starting in the standard, left-lateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">decubitus</z:e> position, and 51 to the prone position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average cecal intubation time for the standard group was 550 vs. 424 s in the prone group (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient repositioning was used in 28 % of patients in the standard group versus 8 % in the prone group (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in subjective reports of pain between groups (p = 0.95) or in average pain scores (p = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up interviews were conducted in 93 % of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom said that they would be willing to have repeat colonoscopy in the same position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Performance of colonoscopy in the prone position for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients results in significantly shorter cecal intubation times and decreased need for patient repositioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prone positioning is well accepted and does not significantly increase procedure-related discomfort </plain></SENT>
