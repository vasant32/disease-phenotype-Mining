<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 1,344 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent thoracic computerized tomography scans between January 2003 and December 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those with any distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> or who were already known to have pulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Number, size, shape and location of the nodules were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis was performed to determine the predictive factors for evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1,344 patients, 55 (4.09%) had nodules that met the criteria of an indeterminate pulmonary nodule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 25 ± 17.9 months and the mean time to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> was 15.5 ± 6.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nodules of 17 (30.9%) patients showed progression at follow-up; 8 had metastasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed multiple indeterminate pulmonary nodules (p = 0.006) of parenchymal localization (p = 0.016) with an irregular border (p = 0.002), which is predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that multiple indeterminate pulmonary nodules with an irregular border in a parenchymal location were more likely to represent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of the occurrence of indeterminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was low </plain></SENT>
