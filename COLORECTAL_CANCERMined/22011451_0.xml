<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 391 consecutive cases were examined retrospectively to assess how often cases were upstaged to node positive disease by examining each node in its entirety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 7 out of 391 patients were upstaged by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, of those patients, approximately three could have been detected by chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, approximately 1% of cases were correctly upstaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, six of these seven patients also had at least one additional adverse prognostic factor, and would otherwise have been considered high risk Dukes' B cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Processing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> slices of each lymph node significantly increases laboratory workload and is of minimal clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
