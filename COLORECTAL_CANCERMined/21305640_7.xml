<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, even among patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> for KRAS codons 12 and 13, only a subset respond to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since additional activating mutations downstream of EGFR may also play a role in treatment resistance, we sought to establish the frequency of these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 2121 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> for mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of these samples, comprised of 513 samples <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> for KRAS codons 12 and 13, were tested for mutations in codons 61 and 146 of KRAS, codon 600 of BRAF, and codons 12, 13, and 61 of NRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation status was determined by targeted pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in KRAS codon 12 or 13 were identified in 900/2121 (42.4%) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 513 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> samples tested for additional mutations, 78 samples were mutant for BRAF, 19 for KRAS codon 61, 17 for KRAS codon 146, and 26 for NRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, 140/513 (27.3%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> for KRAS codons 12 and 13 harbored a mutation in another of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> pathway genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While further study is needed to determine the full therapeutic implications of mutations in these codons, mutational testing of these codons may be useful for identifying a significant proportion of patients who may also be resistant to anti-EGFR therapies </plain></SENT>
