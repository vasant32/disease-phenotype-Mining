<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these susceptibility loci known today explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene-gene interaction (GxG) is considered to be one source of the missing heritability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this, we performed a genome-wide search for pair-wise GxG associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk using 8,380 cases and 10,558 controls in the discovery phase and 2,527 cases and 2,658 controls in the replication phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We developed a simple, but powerful method for testing interaction, which we term the Average Risk Due to Interaction (ARDI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With this method, we conducted a genome-wide search to identify SNPs showing evidence for GxG with previously identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility loci from 14 independent regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also conducted a genome-wide search for GxG using the marginal association screening and examining interaction among SNPs that pass the screening threshold (p&lt;10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the known locus rs10795668 (10p14), we found an interacting SNP rs367615 (5q21) with replication p = 0.01 and combined p = 4.19×10(-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the top marginal SNPs after LD pruning (n = 163), we identified an interaction between rs1571218 (20p12.3) and rs10879357 (12q21.1) (nominal combined p = 2.51×10(-6); Bonferroni adjusted p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study represents the first comprehensive search for GxG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and our results may provide new insight into the genetic etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
