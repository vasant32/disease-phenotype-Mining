<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in overall survival are often explained by differences in the stage at diagnosis and stage-specific survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparing stage at diagnosis using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry data is challenging because of different regional practices in defining stage, despite the existence of international staging classifications such as TNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper describes how stage data may be reconciled for international analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry data were collected for 2.4 million adults diagnosed with colorectal, lung, breast (women) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> during 1995-2007 in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stage data received were coded to a variety of international systems, including the TNM classification, Dukes' for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, FIGO for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, and to national "localised, regional, distant" categorisations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To optimise comparability for analysis, a rigorous and repeatable process was defined to produce a final stage variable for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An algorithm was also defined to map TNM, Dukes' and FIGO to a "localised, regional, distant" categorisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend how stage data should be recorded and processed to optimise comparability in population-based international comparisons of stage-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The process we describe to produce comparable stage data forms a benchmark for future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The algorithm to convert between TNM and a "localised, regional, distant" categorisation should be valuable for international studies, until global consensus is achieved to adhere to a single staging system like TNM </plain></SENT>
