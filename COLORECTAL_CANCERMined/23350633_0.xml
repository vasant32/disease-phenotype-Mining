<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to compare survival after stage III CC in patients with HNPCC with those having <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 230 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary cancer</z:e> from The Danish HNPCC-Register and 3557 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CC from The Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Database, diagnosed during May 2001-December 2008 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HNPCC patients were classified according to Mismatch Repair mutation status and family pedigree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> cases had no known family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, geographic differences and survival data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) was better in HNPCC patients compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CC after stratification for sex and age (p=0.02; CI 1.04-1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival was 70% in HNPCC patients compared with 56% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CC (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No survival difference was found between HNPCC subgroups but a tendency of better OS was seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No geographic differences in OS were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 3.9 (0-9.5) years for HNPCC vs 3.2 (0-9.6) years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HNPCC patients with stage III CC have a better OS compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Within HNPCC subgroups, no significant difference in OS was found. © 2013 The Authors </plain></SENT>
