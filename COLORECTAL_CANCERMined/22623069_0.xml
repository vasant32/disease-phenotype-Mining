<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> use in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this prospective cohort study, we examined the association between <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> use, total colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cases (n = 565) from a former case-control study, recruited between 1995 and 2002, were prospectively followed until 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenomas</z:mpath> with a diameter of ≥1 cm and/or (tubulo)villous histology and/or with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and/or ≥3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> detected at the same colonic examination were considered advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> users (use of any supplement during the past year) compared to nonusers and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence were calculated using stratified Cox proportional hazard models for counting processes and were adjusted for age, sex, educational level and number of colonoscopies during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Robust sandwich covariance estimation was used to adjust for the within subject correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A number of 165 out of 565 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> patients had at least one colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence during a median person-time of 5.4 years and of these, 37 patients had at least one advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-third of the total study population (n = 203) used a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to no use, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> use was neither statistically significantly associated with total colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence (HR = 1.03; 95% CI 0.79-1.34) nor with recurrent advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (HR = 1.59; 95% CI 0.88-2.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This prospective cohort study did not suggest an association between <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> use and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
