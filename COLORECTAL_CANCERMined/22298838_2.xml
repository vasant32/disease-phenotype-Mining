<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report outcomes from the PLCO screening FSG program and evaluate the increased yield produced by a second FSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were screened by 60-cm FSG in 10 regional screening centers at study entry and 3 or 5 years later, depending on the time of random assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results from subsequent diagnostic intervention were tracked and recorded in a standardized fashion, and outcomes were compared according to sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protocol discouraged repeat FSG in persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> diagnosed after the initial FSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 77 447 enrollees, 67 073 (86.6%) had at least one FSG and 39���443 (50.9%) had two FSGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic intervention occurred in 74.9% after a positive first FSG and in 78.7% after a positive repeat FSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second FSG increased the screening yield by 32%: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was detected in 37.8 per 1000 persons after first screening and in 49.8 per 1000 persons after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screenings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second FSG increased the yield of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> by 26% in women and by 34% in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 223 subjects who received a diagnosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> within 1 year of a positive FSG, 64.6% had stage I and 17.5% had stage II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Repeat FSG increased the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in women by one-fourth and in men by one-third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Screen-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were early stage (stage I or II) in greater than 80% of screened persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality data from the PLCO, as the definitive endpoint, will follow in later publications </plain></SENT>
