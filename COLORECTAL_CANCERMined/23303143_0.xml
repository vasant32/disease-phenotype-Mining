<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to investigate the risk of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> in relation to subsite as a basis for planning surveillance strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed, population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry (The Netherlands <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a stage I, II, or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed between 1989 and 2008 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence, standardized incidence ratio, and absolute excess risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary cancers</z:e> in subsites of the colon and rectum were estimated for follow-up periods of 2 to 5, 6 to 10, and more than 10 years after the index <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in patients older than 50 years and in those aged 50 years or younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 123,347 patients had a first invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed between 1989 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 1849 patients (1.5%) had a second colorectal lesion that was found more than 1 year after the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and diagnosed as a second primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients older than 50 years, the 20-year cumulative incidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancers</z:e> was 3.4% in the proximal colon, 1.2% in the distal colon, and 1.2% in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than 60% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancers</z:e> occurred within 5 years after the index <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The standardized incidence ratio was highest in the proximal-colon (1.9; 95% CI, 1.8-2.0), followed by the distal-colon (1.0, 95% CI, 0.9-1.1), and the rectum (0.9, 95% CI, 0.8-1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The corresponding absolute excess risks per 10 000 person years were 9 in the proximal colon, 0.1 in the distal colon, and 1 in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 5 years of follow-up, elevated risk was observed only in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A similar risk pattern was observed in patients younger than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The absolute excess risk for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> in the proximal colon increased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The proportion of stage III and stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancers</z:e> increased from 31% during the first 5 years of follow-up to 38% after 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study included lack of data regarding polypectomy rates and interval of surveillance colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the general population, individuals with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have a higher risk for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsites of the colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Among long-term survivors older than 50 years, risk remains elevated only in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further studies should be encouraged to develop a suitable surveillance method for aging, high-risk, long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
