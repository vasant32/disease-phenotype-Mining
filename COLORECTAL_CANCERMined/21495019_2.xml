<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether these exposures are associated with survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Men and women diagnosed with incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1998 and 2007 in 13 counties in western Washington State were identified by using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on smoking history and alcohol consumption was collected by telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up for mortality was completed through linkage to the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations among smoking, alcohol consumption, and mortality after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses were conducted by sex, age at diagnosis (&lt;50 years, â‰¥ 50 years), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site (proximal, distal, rectal), stage (I-II, III-IV), and microsatellite instability status (stable/low, high) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Disease-specific and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were significantly higher for smokers (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09-1.74) compared with never-smokers (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.24-1.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this association was most prominent in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> exhibiting high microsatellite instability (HR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.32-11.11) and did not extend to those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.72-1.61) or those diagnosed before age 50 years (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.67-1.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alcohol consumption was not associated with disease-specific or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, regardless of patient or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In addition to an association with disease risk, smoking is associated with increased mortality after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association is especially pronounced for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with high microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
