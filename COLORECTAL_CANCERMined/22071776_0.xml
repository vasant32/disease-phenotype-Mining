<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcome of patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CRLM) treated with stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following IRB approval, a retrospective evaluation of 98 SRFA treatment sessions of 189 CRLMs in 63 consecutive patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence rate (LR), overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LR was identified in 16% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (31/189), with no significant differences (P = 0.635) when comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> sizes &lt;3 cm (17.7%), 3-5 cm (11.1%) and &gt;5 cm (17.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median OS from SRFA treatment was 33.2 months after a mean follow-up of 25 months (range 2-66); the corresponding 1-, 3- and 5- year survival rates were 87%, 44% and 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median OS was significantly different when comparing unresectable and resectable patients (27 vs. 58 months, P = 0.002) with OS rates of 92%, 66% and 48% at 1, 3 and 5 years in resectable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> size did not affect OS and DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the favourable outcome, SRFA challenges resection as first-line local treatment of patients with CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As long as randomised studies are pending, we recommend entering an individual decision-making process with every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS: Large colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> can be effectively treated by stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using SRFA the overall survival is not affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SRFA achieves similar overall and disease-free survival rates as surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SRFA challenges surgical resection as the first-line treatment for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
