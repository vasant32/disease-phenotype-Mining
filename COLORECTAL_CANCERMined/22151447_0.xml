<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, involvement of both the hepatic lobes or extrahepatic disease (EHD) can be a contra-indication for resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the addition of combined <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission and computed tomography (PET/CT) to CLM staging to assess the effects upon staging and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CLM patients referred to a single centre between January 2005 and January 2009 were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent routine staging (clinical examination and computed tomography), followed by a whole body (18) fluoro-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ((18)FDG)-PET/CT scan and Fong clinical risk score calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were included [63% male with a median age of 63 years (age range 32-79 years)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of PET/CT led to disease upstaging in 20 patients (31%) and downstaging in two patients (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EHD was found in 24% of low-risk patients (Fong score 0-2) as compared with 44% of high-risk patients (Fong score 3-5) (P= 0.133) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards a greater influence upon management in patients with a low score (44% vs. 17%; P= 0.080) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of PET/CT led to management changes in over one-third of patients but there was no correlation between alterations in staging or management and the Fong clinical risk score; suggesting that PET/CT should be utilized, where available, in the pre-operative staging of CLM patients </plain></SENT>
