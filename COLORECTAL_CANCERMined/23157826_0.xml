<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells were collected by microdissection from paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues from 167 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted and mutations of KRAS gene (codons 12 and 13) were detected by scorpions amplification refractory mutation system (Scorpions ARMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutations were identified in 66 patients (39.5%), including G13D (21 cases, 12.6%), G12D (15 cases, 9.0%), G12V (13 cases, 7.8%), G12C (6 cases, 3.6%), G12A (5 cases, 3.0%), G12S (4 cases, 2.4%) and G12R (2 cases, 1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female patients had a higher KRAS mutation rate than male (50.0%, 29/58 vs.33.9%, 37/109, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, KRAS mutations did not correlate with the patient age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sites, histological types and grades (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 7 of 18 patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had KRAS gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, KRAS gene mutation was identified in 59 patients among 149 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (39.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in KRAS mutation between primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate of KRAS mutation is higher in female <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients than the males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of KRAS mutation does not significantly correlate with the patients' age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, differentiation grades and histological types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in KRAS mutation between the primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
