<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CDK8 is either amplified or mutated in a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and CDK8 functions as an oncoprotein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that loss or reduction of CDK8 results in aberrant fat accumulation in Drosophila and mammals, suggesting that CDK8 plays an important role in inhibiting lipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies have identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and overweight as the major risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e>, thus we examined whether CDK8 regulates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> cell growth by using several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> cell lines, including KLE, which express low levels of CDK8, as well as AN3 CA and HEC-1A cells, which have high levels of endogenous CDK8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that ectopic expression of CDK8 in KLE cells inhibited cell proliferation and potently blocked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in an in vivo mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, gain of CDK8 in KLE cells blocked cell migration and invasion in transwell, wound healing and persistence of migratory directionality assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, we observed the opposite effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the aforementioned assays when CDK8 was depleted in AN3 CA cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar to AN3 CA cells, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CDK8 in HEC-1A cells strongly enhanced cell migration in transwell assays, while overexpression of CDK8 in HEC-1A cells blocked cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, gene profiling of KLE cells overexpressing CDK8 revealed genes whose protein products are involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, cell cycle and cell movement pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CDK8 increased the expression of lipogenic genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results show a reverse correlation between CDK8 levels and several key features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> cells, including cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in contrast to the oncogenic effects of CDK8 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, our results suggest that CDK8 plays a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressive role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
