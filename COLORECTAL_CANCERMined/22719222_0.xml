<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current meta-analysis was performed to address a more accurate estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 41 (17,552 cases and 26,238 controls), 24(8,263 cases and 12,033 controls), 12(3,758 cases and 5,646 controls), and 13 (5,511 cases and 7,265 controls) studies were finally included for the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1289C, methione synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G, methionine synthase (MTR) A2756G polymorphisms and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data showed that the MTHFR 677T allele was significantly associated with reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 0.93, 95%CI 0.90-0.96), while the MTRR 66G allele was significantly associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 1.11, 95%CI 1.01-1.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sub-group analysis by ethnicity revealed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Asians (OR = 0.80, 95%CI 0.72-0.89) and Caucasians (OR = 0.84, 95%CI 0.76-0.93) in recessive genetic model, while the MTRR 66GG genotype was found to significantly increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Caucasians (GG vs. AA: OR = 1.18, 95%CI 1.03-1.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between MTHFR A1298C and MTR A2756G polymorphisms and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative meta-analysis showed no particular time trend existed in the summary estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Probability of publication bias was low across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons illustrated by the funnel plots and Egger's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, this meta-analysis suggested that MTHFR 677T allele might provide protection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in worldwide populations, while MTRR 66G allele might increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since potential confounders could not be ruled out completely, further studies were needed to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
