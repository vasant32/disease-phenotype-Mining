<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed agreement beyond chance of location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> detected at colonoscopy and of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> to estimate the share of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> that might be due to field effects or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> recrudescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a population-based case-control study conducted in Germany (3,148 cases), detailed history and results of colonoscopies conducted within 10 years prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis were obtained by interview and from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined the observed proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> for which a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> had been detected at the same colorectal subsite at the preceding colonoscopy and compared it to the proportion expected by chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>155 cases with physician validated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection at the preceding colonoscopy were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 148 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> restricted to a single subsite, 43 (29.1%) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detected in the same colorectal subsite at the preceding colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agreement of location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> occurrence and preceding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection would have been expected by chance for 27 cases, and agreement beyond chance was estimated to account for 16 cases (10.8%, 95% confidence interval 2.7-19.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that less than one out of 9 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> occurring within 10 years after colonoscopy with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection may be due to field effects or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> recrudescence.
