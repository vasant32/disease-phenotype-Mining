<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The association between prediagnostic 25(OH)D levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific (N = 444) and overall mortality (N = 541) was prospectively examined among 1,202 participants diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between 1992 and 2003 in the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate HRs and corresponding 95% CIs according to 25(OH)D quintiles and genetic variation within the VDR and CASR genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic effect modifiers were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 541 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 444 (82%) due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 73 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, higher 25(OH)D levels were associated with a statistically significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific (P(trend) = 0.04) and overall mortality (P(trend) = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants with 25(OH)D levels in the highest quintile had an adjusted HR of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.50-0.93) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mortality and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50-0.88) for overall mortality, compared with the lowest quintile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except for a possible interaction by prediagnostic dietary calcium intake (P(interaction) = 0.01), no other potential modifying factors related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The VDR (FokI and BsmI) and CASR (rs1801725) genotypes were not associated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High prediagnostic 25(OH)D levels are associated with improved survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Our findings may stimulate further research directed at investigating the effects of blood <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels before, at, and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis on outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
