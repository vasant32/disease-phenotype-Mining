<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the predictive value of loss of PTEN expression in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies were systematically identified to investigate the relationship between PTEN expression and clinical outcome in mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR MoAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pooled relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) was estimated using a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 852 patients were included in the final meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of loss of PTEN expression was 28.4% (242/852) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall pooled RR for ORR was 0.413 (95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.177-0.965) when patients with loss of PTEN expression were compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PTEN expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-EGFR monoclonal therapy resulted in improved PFS (HR, 0.466; 95% CI, 0.292-0.640) and OS (HR, 0.689 [95% CI, 0.482-0.896]) in patients unselected by KRAS mutation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PTEN expression over loss of PTEN expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A better prognosis, as reflected by PFS (HR, 0.344; 95% CI, 0.154-0.533) and OS (HR, 0.544; 95% CI, 0.285-0.803), was observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PTEN expression versus loss of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss of expression of PTEN is a potential biomarker for resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal therapy, particularly in mCRC patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
