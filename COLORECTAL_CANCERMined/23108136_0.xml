<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a direct role of the VEGF-A/VEGFR pathway inhibition in this phenomenon is a matter of debate and molecular mechanisms leading to Treg modulation in this setting have not been explored to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treg proportion, number, and proliferation were analyzed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting specifically VEGF-A, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>-bearing mice (CT26) treated with drugs targeting the VEGF/VEGFR axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The direct impact of VEGF-A on Treg induction was assessed together with specific blockade of different isoforms of VEGFRs that may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In CT26-bearing mice, anti-VEGF antibody and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> treatments reduced Treg but masitinib, a TKI not targeting VEGFR, did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Targeting VEGF-A/VEGFR axis seems sufficient to affect Treg percentages, without any changes in their function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, bevacizumab inhibited Treg accumulation in peripheral blood of patients with mCRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, Treg expressing VEGFR from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice directly proliferated in response to VEGF-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-VEGF-A treatment decreased Treg proliferation in mice as well as in patients with mCRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VEGFR-2- but not VEGFR-1-specific blockade led to the same results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We identified a novel mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> escape by which VEGF-A directly triggers Treg proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This proliferation is inhibited by VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anti-VEGF-A therapies also have immunologic effects that may be used with a therapeutic goal in the future </plain></SENT>
