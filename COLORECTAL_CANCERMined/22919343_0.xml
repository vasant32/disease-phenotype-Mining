<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The early diagnosis of malignant and premalignant changes of the bronchial mucosa remains a major challenge during bronchoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravital staining techniques are not new </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous small case series suggested that analysis of the bronchial mucosal surface using chromoendoscopy allows a prediction between neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate chromobronchoscopy as a method to identify malignant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> in the central airways in a prospective manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 26 patients we performed chromoendoscopy with 0.1% <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> during ongoing flexible white light bronchoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circumscribed lesions in central airways were further analyzed by biopsies and histopathologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the majority of cases neither flat nor polypoid lesions in the central airways were stained by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, exophytic growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> did not show any specific pattern in chromobronchoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a specific dye staining was detected in one case where exophytic growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> was present in the right upper lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two other cases, a circumscribed staining was noted in unsuspicious mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But histology revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous studies, the present findings clearly indicate that chromobronchoscopy is not useful for early detection of malignant or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> of the central airways </plain></SENT>
