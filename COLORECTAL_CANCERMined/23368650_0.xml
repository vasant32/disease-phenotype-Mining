<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: previous studies with patients having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> have shown that quality of life scores depend on the clinical stage of the disease (the more advanced the disease, the worst quality of life) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: in a prospective study we studied 317 patients with gastric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> attending the Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog√≠a between 2010 and 2011; the patients completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 before receiving treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This instrument measures quality of life in 15 domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scores of each domain were compared according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differential Item Functioning was measured across <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> staging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 145 patients (45.7%) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to clinical staging, differences in quality of life scores were observed in 4 of 15 domains (physical and social functioning, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the differences in quality of life domains depended on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization (patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> had the highest scores in quality of life) and sex (women reported better scores) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences seemed to be independent of item properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The construct was more adequately measured with items that explore the construct using a general approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: in this group of patients with colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> quality of life scores were more related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization than with clinical stage </plain></SENT>
