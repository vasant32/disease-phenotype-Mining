<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To overcome the limitation of 2D electrophoresis, an analysis method was developed for identification of differentially expressed proteins in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and cancerous colonic tissues using self-pack <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatite</z:chebi> (HA) column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> and cancerous colon tissues were homogenized and proteins were extracted using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37583,37586">sodium phosphate</z:chebi> buffer at pH 6.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein concentration was determined and the proteins were loaded unto the HA column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HA column reduced the complexity of proteins mixture by fractionating the proteins according to their ionic strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further protein separation was accomplished by a simple and cost effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein bands were subjected to in-gel digestion and protein analysis was performed using electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 17 upregulated proteins and seven downregulated proteins detected with significant differential expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of these proteins were low abundant proteins or proteins with extreme pH that were usually under presented in 2D gel analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have identified brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> carrier protein 1, T-cell surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> CD1a, SOSS complex subunit B2, and Protein Jade 1 which were previously not detected in 2D gel analysis method </plain></SENT>
