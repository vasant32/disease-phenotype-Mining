<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether -4817 G&gt;A (rs2238136) polymorphism located at 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the human <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR) gene was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study and VDR genotypes, determined by Bpu10I restriction endonuclease digestion of PCR-amplified DNA, were performed on 327 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 327 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of VDR -4817 G&gt;A genotypes and alleles differed significantly between cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and controls even after adjustment for confounding factors such as age, BMI, sex, and smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals carrying the "AA" genotype had a 2.09-fold increased risk compared with those with "GG" genotype (P = 0.016, OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.15-3.78) and a 1.87-fold increased risk compared with those with "GG and GA" genotypes (P = 0.033, OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.05-3.33) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the VDR "A" allele was significantly overrepresented in cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than controls (P = 0.044; OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01-1.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the analysis of the SNP revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these associations were stronger for women subjects than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicated for the first time a direct association between "AA" genotype of VDR gene -4817 G&gt;A polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, with a stronger association for female subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, our findings remain to be confirmed in other populations </plain></SENT>
