<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Self-avoidance behavior has been shown to depend on cell-specific membrane proteins that trigger mutual repulsion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the unexpected discovery that a diffusible cue, the axon guidance protein UNC-6 (Netrin), is required for self-avoidance of sister dendrites from the PVD nociceptive neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used time-lapse imaging to show that dendrites fail to withdraw upon mutual contact in the absence of UNC-6 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose a model in which the UNC-40 (Deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e>; <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) receptor captures UNC-6 at the tips of growing dendrites for interaction with UNC-5 on the apposing branch to induce mutual repulsion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UNC-40 also responds to dendritic contact through another pathway that is independent of UNC-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings offer a new model for how an evolutionarily conserved morphogenic cue and its cognate receptors can pattern a fundamental feature of dendritic architecture </plain></SENT>
