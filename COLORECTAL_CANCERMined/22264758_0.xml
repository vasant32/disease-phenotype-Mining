<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to find new drugs with anticancer activities, we combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23403">coumarins</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53720">polysulfides</z:chebi> in the form of di-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53720">polysulfides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These novel compounds were tested in the HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It turned out that they reduced cell viability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells in a time and concentration dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells tested with these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53720">polysulfides</z:chebi> accumulate in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle and finally they go into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A decrease in bcl-2 level, and increase in the level of bax, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release into the cytosol, cleavage of caspase 3/7and PARP suggested that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53720">polysulfides</z:chebi> induced the intrinsic pathway of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of these new <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> compounds with the well known diallyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53720">polysulfides</z:chebi> revealed that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfides</z:chebi> were more active than the corresponding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4488">diallyl disulfides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The activities of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> tetrasulfides and the corresponding diallyl tetrasulfides are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The novel <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> compounds regulated the phosphatase activity of the cell cycle regulating cdc25 family members, indicating that these phosphatases are implicated in the induction of cell cycle arrest and possibly in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53720">polysulfides</z:chebi> also down-regulated the level of cdc25C, which also contributed to the arrest in the G(2)-phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
