<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A phenomenon of serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biomarker surge or flare that ensues shortly after initiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy and that may precede the actual therapeutic response-related decline is poorly understood and remains under-appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it may have a significant clinical implication as it could be misinterpreted in clinical practice as therapeutic failure and lead to a premature discontinuation of potentially effective therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study, attempts have been made to understand the behavior of this phenomenon with respect to a reported median incidence, duration, and its relationship to clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of these analyses suggest a significantly lower incidence of this phenomenon with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as determined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and prostate specific antigen (PSA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> as compared to the other biomarkers studied (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, regardless of the type of biomarker or the extent of its incidence, a therapy-related initial surge appears to correlate with eventual response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although, the biologic significance of this phenomenon is currently elusive, two distinct hypothesis-generating cases with CEA and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are presented that, if supported by further research, would provide insights into the role of a biomarker surge in overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> control by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
