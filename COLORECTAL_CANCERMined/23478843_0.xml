<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examine incidence trends by subsite in a population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> cases diagnosed in the 1985-2005 period were identified through the Tuscany <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colon subsite was defined as proximal and distal; gender, age at diagnosis, histology, and stage were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average annual incidence and age-specific rates according to subsite were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 21,160 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases were extracted; in 18,311 cases, the subsite was identified: 6,916 rectal, 5,239 proximal, and 6,156 distal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A larger proportion of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> presented as early stage when compared with proximal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence of rectal and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> remained stable, while proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> incidence increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> incidence rate increased through the period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Temporal variations in the incidence rate by subsite could suggest different carcinogenic pathways of right- and left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
