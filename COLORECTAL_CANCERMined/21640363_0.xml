<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The livers of 33 WAG/Rij Crl rats were seeded with CC-531 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After we checked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development, 10 rats received hepatic intra-arterial infusions of Lipiodol(Â®) with nanoparticles of Fe(3)O(4) in suspension, and 5 were reserved as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Axial STIR (TR: 3,600 ms/TE: 29 ms/TI: 130 ms) and gradient-echo (GE) (120/4 and 120/14) MRI sequences were acquired on a 1.5 T scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After necropsy, rats were classified into one of two stages according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development: early (&lt;10 metastases, each &lt; 3mm) or advanced (&gt;10 metastases, each &gt;3 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples of liver and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were taken from the 15 animals for quantification of iron concentrations by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed using nonparametric tests; values of p &lt; 0.05 were considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five animals had early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and five had advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the GE sequences, early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> showed homogeneous signal reduction attributable to the presence of magnetofluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Spectrometry found significant differences between the iron concentration in rats with early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and controls (p=0.002) as well as between rats with early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and those with late stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ratio of exogenous iron in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and in liver in early stage rats was 2.6:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The concentration of exogenous iron in the liver was significantly different from that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> only in early stage animals (p=0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI and spectrometry made it possible to evaluate the vascular distribution of magnetofluid in the liver and revealed the differences in its affinity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in different stages of disease </plain></SENT>
