<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> cases were geographically linked to either Inuit Nunangat or the rest of Canada using postal codes or other geographic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Population estimates were derived from the 2001 and 2006 censuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> cases were combined from 1998 to 2007 for Inuit Nunangat and the rest of Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and sub-sites by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardised rate ratios between these 2 areas were calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and sub-sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-standardised incidence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites (1998-2007) was 14% lower for the Inuit Nunangat male population and 29% higher for the female population by comparison to the rest of Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153392,C0238301" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers of the nasopharynx</z:e>, lung and bronchus, colorectal, stomach (males), and kidney and renal pelvis (females), were elevated in the Inuit Nunangat population compared to the rest of Canada, whereas prostate and female <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> were lower in the Inuit Nunangat population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> with potentially modifiable risk factors, such as buccal cavity and pharynx, nasopharynx, lung and bronchus, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were elevated in the Inuit Nunangat population compared to the rest of Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides greater smoking prevalence within Inuit Nunangat by comparison to the rest of Canada, distinct socioeconomic characteristics between respective area populations including housing, and income may have contributed to incidence differentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that a geographic approach can be used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance when populations of interest are spatially distinguishable, and reside across distinct jurisdictions whose combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries will not completely provide information to identify the population of interest </plain></SENT>
