<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the cost effectiveness of these strategies, under real-life conditions of suboptimal compliance, and the societal cost perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used Markov modeling to analyze data from 787,000 individuals in Singapore, aged 50 to 75 years, with an age-standardized rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of 30 to 40/100,000 in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential outcomes, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and net health benefit were compared between single sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and current recommended screening strategies, and also with a strategy of selective screening based on risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Performing single sigmoidoscopies on individuals when they are 60 years old was the cheapest screening strategy; it would reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence by 19% and mortality by 16%, compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single colonoscopy is less cost effective than a single sigmoidoscopy, unless the proportion of right-sided lesions exceeds 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strategies were compared with no screening; iFOBT and colonoscopic examinations every 10 years each had extended dominance over other strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Screening subjects 50 to 60 years old by iFOBT and subjects 60 to 72 years old with colonoscopies every 10 years was the most cost-effective strategy (US$25,000/quality-adjusted life-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, adherence, and cost of colonoscopy were the main determinants of cost effectiveness, based on sensitivity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Markov modeling analysis indicates that selectively screening individuals for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> based on risk is the most cost-effective approach; it limits the cost and number of colonoscopies needed and significantly reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
