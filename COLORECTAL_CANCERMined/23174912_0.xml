<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An additional retrospective analysis was performed to define the prognostic value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> KRAS status on progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: KRAS data (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> KRAS status and type of mutation) were collected by questionnaire from participating centres that performed KRAS analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data were then cross-referenced with efficacy data for relevant patients in the MACRO study database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS status was analysed in 394 of the 480 patients (82.1%) in the MACRO study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (WT) KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were found in 219 patients (56%) and mutant (MT) KRAS in 175 patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 10.9 months for patients with WT KRAS and 9.4 months for patients with MT KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (p=0.0038; HR: 1.40; 95% CI:1.12-1.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in OS was also significant: 26.7 months versus 18.0 months for WT versus MT KRAS, respectively (p=0.0002; HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.23-1.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that KRAS was an independent variable for both PFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Responses were observed in 126 patients (57.5%) with WT KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and 76 patients (43.4%) with MT KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (p=0.0054; OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.18-2.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This analysis of the MACRO study suggests a prognostic role for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> KRAS status in patients with mCRC treated with XELOX plus bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For both PFS and OS, KRAS status was an independent factor in univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
