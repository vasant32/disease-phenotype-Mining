<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nearly two-thirds of annual mortality worldwide is attributable to non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e> (NCDs), with 70% estimated to occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) accounts for over 600 000 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> annually, but data concerning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rates in LMIC is very poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analyses the data available to produce an estimate of the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DATA FOR THIS ANALYSIS CAME FROM TWO MAIN SOURCES: a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE and Global Health which found 15 published data sets, and an additional 42 unpublished data sets which were sourced from the IARC and individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data for case rates by age and sex, as well as population denominators were extracted and analysed to produce an estimate of incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The crude incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in SSA for both sexes was found to be 4.04 per 100 000 population (4.38 for men and 3.69 for women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence increased with age with the highest rates in Southern Africa, particularly in South Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in SSA were much lower than those reported for high-income countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Few health services in SSA are equipped to provide timely diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in SSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, data collection systems are weak, meaning that the available statistics may underestimate the burden of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In order to improve health care services it is vital that accurate measurements of disease burden are available to policy makers </plain></SENT>
