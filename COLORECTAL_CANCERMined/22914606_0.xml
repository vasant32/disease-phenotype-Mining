<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: The prevalence of p53 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> could reach 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most important regulator of this protein that was identified originally was the Murine Double Minute2 (MDM2) oncoprotein, by which the levels of p53 were fixed through an autoregulatory feedback loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases, the overexpression of MDM2 deregulates this feedback, and the signaling pathway between MDM2 and p53 is blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS:: We genotyped 167 patients and 167 healthy blood donors to determinate the mutational status of MDM2 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The MDM2 polymorphism study showed a higher distribution of MDM2 SNP309 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the majority of samples with SNP309 indicated a positive expression of MDM2 protein in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, we found a first significant association between p53 expression and the single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and a second association between the MDM2 polymorphism and p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the nuclear overexpression of MDM2 and SNP309 was significantly related to a higher mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: In this work we wanted to highlight the role, which is becoming increasingly important, of MDM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In fact, we conclude that the effects of MDM2 SNP309 may be considered a valuable prognostic marker to predict poor outcome for Tunisian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
