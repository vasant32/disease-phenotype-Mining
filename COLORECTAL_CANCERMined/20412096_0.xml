<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between September 2004 and December 2008, 271 consecutive patients (146 men and 125 women; median age 68 years, range: 34-91 years) with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent combined liver ultrasound and CEUS following intravenous injection of 2.4 ml of SonoVue(TM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interval from injection to arrival time in the hepatic vein (ATHV) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced MDCT in the portal phase was performed and interpreted blindly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, intra-operative ultrasound was used as the reference point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or biopsy was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suspicious lesions or if there was inconsistency in the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Liver metastases</z:e> were detected in 21 (8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both CEUS and MDCT had a sensitivity of 85.7%, with respective specificities of 97.6% and 95.6%, and positive predictive values of 75%vs 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The negative predictive value of both methods was 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, ATHV was 18 and 22 s, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEUS has potential as a diagnostic alternative to MDCT in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ATHV was shorter in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
