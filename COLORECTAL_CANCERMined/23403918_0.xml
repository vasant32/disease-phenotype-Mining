<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) is the most abundant IGFBP in the circulation and its main role is to regulate the amount of free, receptor-reactive IGFs that are involved in a broad range of metabolic and mitogenic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IGFBP-3 interacts with several other biomolecules forming complexes that might have IGF-dependent or independent functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transferrin (Tf) forms complexes with IGFBP-3, but the physiological significance of this interaction remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tf is an iron-transporting protein, and is able to carry other metal ions as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IGFBP-3, on the other hand, possesses one metal-binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As both proteins have the ability to bind metals, the formation of the IGFBP-3-Tf complexes may be expected to influence the metabolism of metal ions and/or mitogenic/metabolic roles in which IGFBP-3 is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantify the amount of complexes in the circulation, to investigate the importance of a specific metal ion for their formation and isolation, and to search for the possible physiological place of the IGFBP-3-Tf complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of the following ions were analyzed: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29034">Fe3+</z:chebi>, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mg2+ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29105">Zn2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results have shown that the amount of IGFBP-3 involved in the complex formation with Tf in healthy persons was 5.4 Â± 1.02 nM and iron ions were substantial for their formation and isolation without employment of harsh conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The amount of IGFBP-3-Tf complexes was further determined in persons with iron over-load, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> and patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The amount of complexes was in direct correlation with the concentrations of iron and IGFBP-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the case of the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, the amount of complexes was inversely correlated with the concentration of ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IGFBP-3, thus, appears to be a member of a network of iron-binding proteins that participates in cell signaling that involves iron-associated response </plain></SENT>
