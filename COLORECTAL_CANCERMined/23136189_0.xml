<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: More than 20 million archival tissue samples are stored annually in the United States as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, but <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> degradation during fixation and storage has prevented their use for transcriptional profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New and highly sensitive assays for whole-transcriptome microarray analysis of FFPE tissues are now available, but resulting data include noise and variability for which previous expression array methods are inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We present the two largest whole-genome expression studies from FFPE tissues to date, comprising 1,003 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and 168 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> samples, combined with a meta-analysis of 14 new and published FFPE microarray datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We develop and validate quality control (QC) methods through technical replication, independent samples, comparison to results from fresh-frozen tissue, and recovery of expected associations between gene expression and protein abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Archival tissues from large, multicenter studies showed a much wider range of transcriptional data quality relative to smaller or frozen tissue studies and required stringent QC for subsequent analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We developed novel methods for such QC of archival tissue expression profiles based on sample dynamic range and per-study median profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This enabled validated identification of gene signatures of microsatellite instability and additional features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and improved recovery of associations between gene expression and protein abundance of MLH1, FASN, CDX2, MGMT, and SIRT1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These methods for large-scale QC of FFPE expression profiles enable study of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> transcriptome in relation to extensive clinicopathological information, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> molecular biomarkers, and long-term lifestyle and outcome data </plain></SENT>
