<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to perform a direct comparison of the prognostic roles of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation status of HLTF and HPP1 was examined in pretherapeutic sera of 311 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and matched primary tissues of 54 stage IV patients using methylation-specific quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CEA was determined using an immunoenzymometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation of HLTF and HPP1 DNA in serum significantly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, stage, grade and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HPP1 methylation correlated with nodal status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was shortened in case of methylation of HLTF or HPP1 or elevated levels of CEA (p &lt; 0.0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In stage IV, patients survival was impaired if HLTF (p = 0.0005) or HPP1 (p = 0.0003) were methylated or CEA was above the median of 27 ng/ml (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that methylation of HLTF [hazard ratio (HR) 1.8, p = 0.0438], HPP1 (HR 1.6, p = 0.0495) and CEA &gt;27 ng/ml (HR 1.7, p = 0.0317) were independent prognostic factors in stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of any two or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of these factors outperformed each marker on its own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the presence of methylated DNA of the genes HLTF or HPP1 in serum are independent prognostic factors in metastasized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
