<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent evidence suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence can also be visualized by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-fluoro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CEA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in patients with suspected recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by comparing PET/CT performance in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CEA levels with PET/CT performance in patients with elevated CEA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 235 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who had been treated with surgery and/or chemotherapy/radiotherapy underwent PET/CT for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients [96 females and 139 males; age (mean ± SD) 59.9 ± 12.6 years; range 18-85] were divided into 2 groups based on whether their CEA levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (&lt;5 ng/ml) (Group 1, n = 118) or elevated (&gt;5 ng/ml) (Group 2, n = 117) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had suspected recurrence based on raised CEA levels, clinical symptoms, and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> detection using other imaging modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 235 patients, 172 (73.1 %) had disease recurrence confirmed by a pathological examination (either biopsy or surgical exploration) or clinical follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FDG-PET/CT study yielded a true positive in detecting recurrence in 169 (71.9 %) patients, a true negative in 53 (22.5 %) patients, a false negative in 3 (1.2 %) patients and a false positive in 10 (4.2 %) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence was detected in 64.4 % (76/118) and 88 % (103/117) patients in Group 1 and Group 2 with FDG-PET/CT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of the FDG-PET/CT study for establishing recurrence were 100, 84, 89.4, 100 and 93.2 %, respectively, for Group 1; by contrast, these parameters were 97.1, 84.6, 98, 78.5 and 95.7 %, respectively, for Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with hepatic and extra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e>, such as lung and abdominal lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, detected with FDG-PET/CT was significantly different in Group 1 than in Group 2; however, the number of patients with local recurrence and peritoneal implants detected with FDG-PET/CT was not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET/CT can accurately detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence in patients with suspected recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, even for patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CEA levels </plain></SENT>
