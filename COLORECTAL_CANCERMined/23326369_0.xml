<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cysteine protease legumain is involved in several biological and pathological processes, and the protease has been found over-expressed and associated with an invasive and metastatic phenotype in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, legumain has been proposed as a prognostic marker for certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and a potential therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, details on how legumain advances malignant progression along with regulation of its proteolytic activity are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present work, legumain expression was examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Substantial differences in amounts of pro- and active legumain forms, along with distinct intracellular distribution patterns, were observed in HCT116 and SW620 cells and corresponding subcutaneous xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Legumain is thought to be located and processed towards its active form primarily in the endo-lysosomes; however, the subcellular distribution remains largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By analyzing subcellular fractions, a proteolytically active form of legumain was found in the nucleus of both cell lines, in addition to the canonical endo-lysosomal residency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ analyses of legumain expression and activity confirmed the endo-lysosomal and nuclear localizations in cultured cells and, importantly, also in sections from xenografts and biopsies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the HCT116 and SW620 cell lines nuclear legumain was found to make up approximately 13% and 17% of the total legumain, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In similarity with previous studies on nuclear variants of related cysteine proteases, legumain was shown to process <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The discovery of nuclear localized legumain launches an entirely novel arena of legumain biology and functions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
