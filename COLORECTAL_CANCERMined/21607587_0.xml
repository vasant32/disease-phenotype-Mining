<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The number of patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to Japanese guidelines, lesions with a submucosal invasive depth &gt;1,000 μm should be treated with radical proctocolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose and evaluate a new clinical classification for pit patterns that uses endoscopy to assess lesion depth for determination of the appropriate therapeutic approach for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic images of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases with type V(I) pit pattern, resected surgically or endoscopically from April 2002 to April 2007 at Showa University Yokohama Northern Hospital, were utilized for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each image was retrospectively analyzed for (A) pit narrowness, (B) irregular pit margins, and (C) indistinct stromal staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value were evaluated as major outcomes, using pathological results as the standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: In total, 186 cases were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> features considered (A, B, and C), the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 47.8%, 86.3%, 66.0%, and 74.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When limited to two features (A and B), these values were 75.3%, 81.2%, 70.2%, and 84.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the established criteria can, to a certain degree, distinguish between high and low irregularity in colorectal lesions with V(I) pit pattern indicating submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> infiltration of more or less than 1,000 μm with the clinical consequence of surgery versus endoscopic mucosal resection/endoscopic mucosal dissection </plain></SENT>
