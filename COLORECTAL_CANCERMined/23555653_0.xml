<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk prediction after exposure to high-LET cosmic heavy ion radiation exposure is hindered due to scarcity of in vivo data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumor</z:e> frequency, size, cluster, and grade were studied in APC(Min/+) mice (n = 20 per group; 6 to 8 wks old; female) 100 to 110 days after exposure to 1.6 or 4 Gy of heavy ion (56)Fe radiation (energy: 1000 MeV/nucleon) and results were compared to γ radiation doses of 2 or 5 Gy, which are equitoxic to 1.6 and 4 Gy (56)Fe respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to relevance of lower doses to radiotherapy treatment fractions and space exploration, we followed 2 Gy γ and equitoxic 1.6 Gy (56)Fe for comparative analysis of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation, differentiation, and β-catenin signaling pathway alterations between the two radiation types using immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls and γ-ray, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumor</z:e> frequency and grade was significantly higher after (56)Fe radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> incidence per unit of radiation (per cGy) was also higher after (56)Fe radiation relative to γ radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staining for phospho-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3, indicative of IEC proliferation, was more and alcian blue staining, indicative of IEC differentiation, was less in (56)Fe than γ irradiated samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Activation of β-catenin was more in (56)Fe-irradiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing areas of the intestinal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When considered along with higher levels of cyclin D1, we infer that relative to γ radiation exposure to (56)Fe radiation induced markedly reduced differentiation, and increased proliferative index in IEC resulting in increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> of larger size and grade due to preferentially greater activation of β-catenin and its downstream effectors </plain></SENT>
