<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PHDs family comprises PHD1, 2, and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that, in addition to HIFα, PHDs have other substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paired box (Pax) 2, a transcription factor, was found aberrantly expressed in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that PHD3 is a negative regulator of expression of Pax2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that PHD3 bound to Pax2 and mediated Pax2 destruction directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PHD3 hydroxylase activity led to upregulation of Pax2 protein but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that Pax2 protein was increased and PHD3 protein was decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and the increased Pax2 was associated with decreased PHD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that PHD3 targets Pax2 for destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings may disclose a mechanism for the regulation of Pax2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
