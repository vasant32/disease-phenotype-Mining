<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have attempted to correlate specific APC mutations with clinical phenotype.6 However, there is considerable variability in the expression of specific phenotypes within families and among individuals with identical mutations.7 CASE PRESENTATION: A 30 year-old Hispanic female presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of persistent, worsening, left lower quadrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sigmoidoscopy revealed innumerable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in the rectum and sigmoid colon and a large mass in the sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy of the mass revealed a moderately differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> invading the subserosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy revealed innumerable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing of the patient via southern blot revealed a germline APC mutation 3927del5, resulting in a premature truncation of the APC protein at amino acid position 1312 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Genetic information has only recently started being incorporated into clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More research and randomized clinical trials need to be conducted to definitively characterize random mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Once these mutations are further understood, FAP patients may be able to be risk stratified and this may ultimately improve the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of this rare condition </plain></SENT>
