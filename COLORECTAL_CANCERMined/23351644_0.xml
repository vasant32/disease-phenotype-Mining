<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to review <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> data from the Saudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (SCR) in order to evaluate the prognostic factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival in Saudi patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a retrospective censored overall survival (OS) analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> data for the period 1994-2004 obtained from the SCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 administrative regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) by the SCR in collaboration with the National Information Center of the Ministry of Interior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative survival rate, which was then stratified by gender and by period (1994-1999 versus 2000-2004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinico-pathological variables that might affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival were analyzed by Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1994 and 2004, 549 CRC cases were diagnosed (363 [66.1%] in males and 186 [33.9%] in females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during this period was 44.6% (44.7% for 1994-1999 and 44.3% for 2000-2004 [p=0.7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant (p=0.003) discrepancy of 9.6% between the male five-year OS (41.0%) and the female five-year OS (50.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The five-year OS was 63.3% for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>, 50.2% for those with regional disease, and 14.7% for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By Cox regression analysis, age and extent were significant prognostic factors of survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>; the risk was higher in patients with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (hazard ratio [HR], 2.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-5.45; p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, the risk was lower in males (HR, 0.66; CI, 0.45-0.98; p=0.04), but higher in patients with unknown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extent (HR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.66-8.24; p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The five-year OS for 1994-2004 was 44.6% for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More so, five-year OS based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stage was generally lower than the typically reported survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The establishment of a national screening program and increased access to specialized medical faculties may be necessary to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival in the KSA </plain></SENT>
