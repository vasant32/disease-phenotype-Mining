<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC), mutations in the KRAS gene predict poor response to EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical treatment guidelines now recommend KRAS testing if EGFR inhibitors are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study investigates the clinical uptake and utilization of KRAS testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 1,188 patients with mCRCs diagnosed from 2004 to 2009, from seven integrated health care delivery systems with a combined membership of 5.5 million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used electronic medical records and targeted manual chart review to capture the complexity and breadth of real-world clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 428 patients (36%) received KRAS testing during their clinical care, and 266 (22%) were treated with EGFR inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age at diagnosis (P = 0.0034), comorbid conditions (P = 0.0316), and survival time from diagnosis (P &lt; 0.0001) influence KRAS testing and EGFR inhibitor prescribing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion who received KRAS testing increased from 7% to 97% for those treated in 2006 and 2010, respectively, and 83% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated patients had a KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients with a KRAS mutation (86%) were not treated with EGFR inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The interval between mCRC diagnosis and receipt of KRAS testing decreased from 26 months (2006) to 10 months (2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings show rapid uptake and incorporation of this predictive biomarker into clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: In this delivery setting, KRAS testing is widely used to guide treatment decisions with EGFR inhibitors in patients with mCRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An important future research goal is to evaluate utilization of KRAS testing in other delivery settings in the United States </plain></SENT>
