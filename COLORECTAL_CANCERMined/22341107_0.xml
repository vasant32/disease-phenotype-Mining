<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colorectal endoscopy (sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy) is thought to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the 1980s, its use has increased in the United States, which may be a reason for decreasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the plausibility of a contribution of colorectal endoscopy use to the decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of temporal trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: U.S. population from 1978 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Using incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, we assessed the subsite-specific cumulative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> developing until age 79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative risk of proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> remained relatively stable over the observation period, varying between 2.09% (95% CI, 2.06%-2.11%) and 2.66% (95% CI,2.62%-2.69%) for men and between 1.90% (95% CI, 1.88%-1.93%) and 2.24% (95% CI, 2.21%-2.27%) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the cumulative risk of distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> decreased from 4.68% (95% CI, 4.64%-4.73%) to 3.03% (95% CI, 3.00%-3.06%) for men and from 3.15% (95% CI, 3.11%-3.18%) to 1.93% (95% CI, 1.91%-1.95%) for women, which was largely attributable to the reduced cumulative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed pattern was restricted to the population aged 50 to 79 years, whereas the magnitude of the decrease was greater for older age groups and similar across stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The study is based on aggregated registry data only; therefore, no inferences about causal effects can be drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results show a major reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, particularly in the sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased use of colorectal endoscopy in the population aged 50 years and older along with environmental factors may have contributed to the decreasing risk </plain></SENT>
