<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the COX-2 tumor-inducing effects are believed to be mediated through overproduction of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)), which can be measured using a urinary metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M was assessed in a case-control study of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Included in the analysis were 224 cases with at least one advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, 152 cases with multiple small tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, 300 cases with only a single small tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, and 364 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-free controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M levels between controls and cases with a single small tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, cases with either an advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or multiple small tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> had more than 25% higher levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants with the highest quartile level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M were approximately 2.5-fold more likely to have advanced or multiple small tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in comparison with those with the lowest level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M [OR = 2.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54-4.14; P(trend) &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association was strongest among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M level was associated with increased risk for multiple or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> but not single small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M may be a useful risk marker for assessing the risk of harboring clinically more important versus less important colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
