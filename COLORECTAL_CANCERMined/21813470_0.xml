<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The authors have previously isolated a putative oncogene, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) from 3q26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, EIF5A2 was characterised for its role in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> and underlying molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression dynamics of EIF5A2 were examined by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of carcinomatous and non-neoplastic colorectal tissues and cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of in-vivo and in-vitro assays was performed to elucidate the function of EIF5A2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overexpression of EIF5A2 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 102/229 (44.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and it was significantly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumour metastasis</z:e> and determined to be an independent predictor of shortened survival (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ectopic overexpression of EIF5A2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells enhanced cell motility and invasion in vitro and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumour metastasis</z:e> in vivo, and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of EIF5A2 expression prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell invasiveness and inhibited EMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-associated protein 1 (MTA1) gene was identified as a potential downstream target of EIF5A2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, and knockdown of MTA1 eliminated the augmentation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell migration, invasion and EMT by ectopic EIF5A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of EIF5A2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells substantially enhanced the enrichment of c-myc on the promoter of MTA1, and MTA1 upregulation by EIF5A2 was partly dependent on c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data suggest that EIF5A2 plays an important oncogenic role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> by the upregulation of MTA1 to induce EMT, and EIF5A2 could be employed as a novel prognostic marker and/or effective therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
