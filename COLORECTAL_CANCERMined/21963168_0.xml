<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work in rats showed that diets high in protein, including red meat, increase colonocyte DNA strand breaks and that this effect is attenuated by resistant starches (RS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomeres are long hexamer repeats that protect against spontaneous DNA damage which would lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere shortening is associated with greater risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to determine the effects of cooked red and white meat intake on colonocyte telomere length in rats and whether dietary RS modified their effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After four weeks of feeding cooked beef or chicken at 15, 25 and 35% of diet with or without RS, colonocyte telomere length was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Telomere length decreased in proportion to red meat content of the diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was observed in the white meat group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colonocyte telomere shortening due to increased dietary meat was attenuated by the inclusion of RS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support previous findings of increased colonocyte DNA damage with greater red and white meat intake and also the protective effect of dietary fibre </plain></SENT>
