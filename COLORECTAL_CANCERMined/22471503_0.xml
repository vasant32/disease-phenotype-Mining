<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate trends in the participation rate of the NCSP for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> overall and according to gender, age and health insurance type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed participation, positivity, and follow-up rates according to these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall participation rates for the NCSP for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> increased from 10.5% in 2004 to 26.2% in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FIT positivity rates decreased from 7.9% in 2004 to 7.1% in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up rates among FIT-positive participants decreased from 64.5% in 2004 to 39.4% in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the participation rate increased each year during the study period, it remained low compared with that of other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FIT positivity rate decreased, however it was relatively high compared with that of other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intervention is essential to raise participation rates, maximize adherence to screening recommendations, and to make certain that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> population subgroups reap the benefits of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, these data suggest that structured and standardized quality improvement activity is essential to high quality for FIT in the NCSP for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in Korea </plain></SENT>
