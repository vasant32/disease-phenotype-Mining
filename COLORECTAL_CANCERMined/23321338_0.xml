<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare PSP detection among endoscopists and to identify patient-related and endoscopist-related factors associated with PSP detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study in unselected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Colonoscopy screening program for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at two academic medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Asymptomatic consecutive screening participants (aged 50-75 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Colonoscopies were performed by 5 experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple colonoscopy quality indicators were prospectively recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: We compared PSP detection among endoscopists by calculating odds ratios (OR) with logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression also was used to identify patient features and colonoscopy factors associated with PSP detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1354 patients underwent a complete screening colonoscopy: 1635 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were detected, of which 707 (43%) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 685 (42%) were serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, including 215 PSPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 167 patients (12%) 1 or more PSPs were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The PSP detection rate differed significantly among endoscopists, ranging from 6% to 22% (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Longer withdrawal time (OR 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.16) was significantly associated with better PSP detection, whereas patient age, sex, and quality of bowel preparation were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Limited number of highly experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The PSP detection rate differs among endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Longer withdrawal times are associated with better PSP detection, but patient features are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>(Clinical trial registration number: NTR1888.) </plain></SENT>
