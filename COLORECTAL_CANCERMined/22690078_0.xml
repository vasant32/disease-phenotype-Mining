<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight hundreds and sixty-one individuals at high-risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six hundreds and eleven subsequently received the three fecal occult blood tests and colonoscopy with biopsy performed as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fecal samples were obtained on the day before colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tf, immuno fecal occult blood test (IFOBT) and guaiac fecal occult blood test (g-FOBT) were performed simultaneously on the same stool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To minimize false-negative cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with negative samples were asked to provide an additional stool specimen for a second test even a third test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the results were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> negative after testing three repeated samples, the subject was considered a true negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The performance characteristics of Tf for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> were examined and compared to those of IFOBT and the combination of Tf, IFOBT and g-FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of six hundreds and eleven subjects met the study criteria including 25 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 60 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 92% for Tf and 96% for IFOBT, specificities of Tf and IFOBT were both 72.0% (95% CI: 68.2%-75.5%; χ² = 0.4, P &gt; 0.05); positive likelihood ratios of those were 3.3 (95% CI: 2.8-3.9) and 3.4 (95% CI: 2.9-4.0), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e>, sensitivities for Tf and IFOBT were 50% and 58%, respectively (χ² = 0.8, P &gt; 0.05); specificities of Tf and IFOBT were 71.5% (95% CI: 67.6%-75.1%) and 72.2% (95% CI: 68.4%-75.8%); positive likelihood ratios of those were 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3-2.3) and 2.1 (95% CI: 1.6-2.7), respectively; compared to IFOBT, g-FOBT+ Tf+ IFOBT had a significantly higher positive rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> (83% vs 58%, respectively; χ² = 9.1, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e>, the sensitivities of Tf and IFOBT were 62% and 69% (χ² = 0.9, P &gt; 0.05); specificities of those were 74.5% (95% CI: 70.6%-78.1%) and 75.5% (95% CI: 71.6%-79.0%); positive likelihood ratios of those were 2.5 (95% CI: 2.0-3.1) and 2.8 (95% CI: 2.3-3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to IFOBT alone, combining g-FOBT, IFOBT and Tf led to significantly increased sensitivity for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and cancerous lesions (69% vs 88%, respectively; χ² = 9.0, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tf dipstick test might be used as an additional tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> screening in a high-risk cohort </plain></SENT>
