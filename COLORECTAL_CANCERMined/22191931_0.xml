<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this work, we considered the feasibility of Raman spectroscopy for discriminating between adenocarcinomatous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal formalin-fixed colonic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike earlier studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, a spectral deconvolution model was implemented to derive spectral information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven samples of human colon were used, and 55 spectra were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each spectrum was resolved into 25 bands from 975 to 1720 cm(-1), where modes of proteins, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and nucleic acids are observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From a comparative study of band intensities, those presenting higher differences between tissue types were correlated to biochemical assignments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results from fitting procedure were further used as inputs for linear discriminant analysis, where combinations of band intensities and intensity ratios were tested, yielding accuracies up to 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis yields objective discriminating parameters after fitting optimization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bands with higher diagnosis relevance detected by spectra deconvolution enable to confine the study to some spectral regions instead of broader ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A critical view upon limitations of this approach is presented, along with a comparison of our results to earlier ones obtained in fresh colonic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This enabled to assess the effect of formalin fixation in colonic tissues, and determine its relevance in the present analysis </plain></SENT>
