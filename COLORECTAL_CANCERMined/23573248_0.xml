<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We tested the a priori hypothesis that self-perceived and real presences of risks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are associated with better knowledge of the symptoms and risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One territory-wide invitation for free <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening between 2008 to 2012 recruited asymptomatic screening participants aged 50-70 years in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They completed survey items on self-perceived and real presences of risks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (advanced age, male gender, positive family history and smoking) as predictors, and knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> symptoms and risk factors as outcome measures, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their associations were evaluated by binary logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 10,078 eligible participants (average age 59 years), the mean knowledge scores for symptoms and risk factors were 3.23 and 4.06, respectively (both score range 0-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.34, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1.20-1.50, p&lt;0.01), self-perception as not having any risks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (AOR = 1.12, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1.01-1.24, p = 0.033) or uncertainty about having risks (AOR = 1.94, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1.55-2.43, p&lt;0.001), smoking (AOR 1.38, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1.11-1.72, p = 0.004), and the absence of family history (AOR 0.61 to 0.78 for those with positive family history, p&lt;0.001) were associated with poorer knowledge scores (≤4) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These factors remained significant for knowledge of risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Male and smokers were more likely to have poorer knowledge but family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was associated with better knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since screening of these higher risk individuals could lead to greater yield of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, educational interventions targeted to male smokers were recommended </plain></SENT>
