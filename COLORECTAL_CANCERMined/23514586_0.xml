<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Participation rates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relatively little is known about screening uptake across varying levels of risk and across population groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to identify factors associated with (i) ever receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) testing; (ii) risk-appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in accordance with guidelines; and (iii) recent colonoscopy screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1592 at-risk persons (aged 56-88 years) were randomly selected from the Hunter Community Study (HCS), Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants self-reported family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was used to quantify risk in accordance with national screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1117 participants returned a questionnaire; 760 respondents were eligible for screening and analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ever receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing was significantly more likely for persons: aged 65-74 years; who had discussed with a doctor their family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or had ever received screening advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For respondents "at or slightly above average risk", guideline-appropriate screening was significantly more likely for persons: aged 65-74 years; with higher household income; and who had ever received screening advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For respondents at "moderately or potentially high risk", guideline-appropriate screening was significantly more likely for persons: with private health insurance and who had discussed their family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with a doctor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy screening was significantly more likely for persons: who had ever smoked; discussed their family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with a doctor; or had ever received screening advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The level of risk-appropriate screening varied across populations groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interventions that target population groups less likely to engage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening are pivotal for decreasing screening inequalities </plain></SENT>
