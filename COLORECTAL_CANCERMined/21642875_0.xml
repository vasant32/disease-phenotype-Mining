<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 2005, the Veterans Health Administration initiated a yearlong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Care Collaborative (C4) to improve timely follow-up after positive fecal occult blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one facilities formed local quality improvement (QI) teams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Teams received QI training, created process flow maps, implemented process changes, and shared learning through 2 face-to-face meetings, conference calls, and a discussion board </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated pre-post change in the timeliness of follow-up among C4 facilities and 3 control facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included the proportion of patients receiving a follow-up colonoscopy within 1 year, the proportion receiving 60-day follow-up (the focus of C4 teams), and average days to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survey data from C4 team members was analyzed to identify predictors of facility-level improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both C4 and control facilities improved on 1-year follow-up (10% and 9% increases, respectively, both P's&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant increase in the proportion receiving 60-day follow-up among C4 facilities (27% pre-C4 vs. 39% post-C4, P=0.008) but a nonsignificant decrease among control facilities (45% pre-C4 vs. 29% post-C4, P=0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average days to colonoscopy decreased significantly among C4 facilities (129 pre-C4 vs. 103 post-C4, P=0.004) but increased significantly among control facilities (81 pre-C4 vs. 103 post-C4, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Teams with the most improvement established clear roles/goals, had previous QI training, made more use of QI tools, and incorporated primary care education into their improvement work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A Veterans Health Administration improvement collaborative modestly decreased time to colonoscopy after a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening test but significant room for improvement remains and benefits of participation were not realized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> facilities </plain></SENT>
