<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of sequential patients with advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> undergoing embolization in the past 10 years at 2 neighboring institutions and with 2 years of follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TACE was generally performed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: One hundred twenty-four patients were included; 77 received TACE and 47 received TAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis stratified by institution, type of embolization and CLIP score significantly predicted PFS and time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), whereas CLIP score and AFP independently predicted overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TACE significantly prolonged PFS and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (P = .0004 and P = .001, respectively), but not OS (P = .83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of chemotherapy to TAE prolongs PFS and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future efforts should focus on adjunctive therapies after the embolization to increase survival </plain></SENT>
