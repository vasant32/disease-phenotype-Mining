<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 2007-2011 were studied, the patients are divided for gender, age, year of surgery, site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and comorbidity on admission and compared with 40 younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Mean (standard deviation) age was 81.3 in OP and 68.3 YP Conversion rate was the same between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in operative mean time  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate was 0% percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical morbidity rate was the same but there was an increased in cardiologic e <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchopneumonia</z:e> complications in older population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with laparoscopic approach had a faster recovery of bowel function and a significant reduction of the mean length of hospital stay not age related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopy allowed a better preservation of postoperative independence status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in elderly patients is safe and beneficial including preservation of postoperative independence and a reduction of length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
