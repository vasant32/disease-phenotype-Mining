<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 2003 to August 2008, 256 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> underwent PET/CT scanning for staging or restaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence was detected in 22 patients (18 men, 4 women) postsurgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 22 patients, 21 (95.5%) underwent positive 2-[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">fluorine-18</z:chebi>]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake and were diagnosed with local recurrence by PET/CT; the results were negative in one case (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for local recurrence were 95.5%, 100%, 100%, and 99.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT/MRI scans yielded the following results: positive, 10 cases (45.5%); suspected positive, 11 cases (50.0%); negative, 1 case (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the suspected positive cases, not only imaging but also colonoscopy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers among other techniques were used for definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PET/CT has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing local recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and would be useful especially in the case of locally <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> suspected to be positive by CT/MRI </plain></SENT>
