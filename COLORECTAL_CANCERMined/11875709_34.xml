<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, plasma may be preferred for vascular endothelial growth factor measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, which specimen is the best predictor of survival is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study analyzed the prognostic value of matched preoperative serum and plasma vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To establish the reference range among healthy people, vascular endothelial growth factor was analyzed in 50 matched EDTA-plasma and serum samples from healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, in 524 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, matched plasma and serum vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, the median plasma vascular endothelial growth factor concentration (44 pg ml(-1)) was significantly (P=0.01) higher than the median plasma vascular endothelial growth factor concentration (30 pg ml(-1)) in the healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In serum, no significant (P=0.30) difference in the median vascular endothelial growth factor concentration was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (268 pg ml(-1)) and healthy blood donors (220 pg ml(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preoperative vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations were dichotomized by the 95th percentile of the healthy blood donors (plasma=112 pg ml(-1), serum=533 pg ml(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate survival analyses, both high plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (&gt;112 pg ml(-1)) and high serum vascular endothelial growth factor (&gt;533 pg ml(-1)) predicted a reduced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate survival analyses, high serum vascular endothelial growth factor (&gt;533 pg ml(-1)) independently predicted a reduced survival (HR=1.65, P=0.015), while high plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (&gt;112 pg ml(-1)) did not (HR=1.27, P=0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that preoperative serum vascular endothelial growth factor apparently is a better predictor of overall survival than the preoperative plasma vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
