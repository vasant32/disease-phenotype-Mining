<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several different treatment protocols for IRIS are commonly used in Japan, besides the one used in the FIRIS study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of a 5-week cycle of IRIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2005 and February 2008, a total of 55 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled at nine centers in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received irinotecan intravenously (80 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 15 and S-1 orally (40-60 mg twice daily, according to body surface area) on days 1-21 of a 5-week repeated cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 29.1 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 43.8 % in patients who received IRIS as first-line therapy and 23.1 % in those who received IRIS as second-line or subsequent therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 678 days (22.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events of Grade 3 or higher that occurred at an incidence of ≥10 % were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (12.7 %) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (10.9 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our efficacy and safety data suggest that a 5-week cycle of IRIS is an effective alternative to used currently regimens </plain></SENT>
