<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> the Apc/β-catenin genes in the Wnt signaling pathway are frequently mutated and active Notch signaling contributes to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> by keeping the epithelial cells in a proliferative state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These pathways are simultaneously active in proliferative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cells and a crosstalk between them has previously been suggested in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, in silico analysis of putative promoters involved in transcriptional regulation of genes coding for proteins in the Notch signaling pathway revealed several putative LEF-1/TCF sites as potential targets for β-catenin and canonical Wnt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further results from competitive electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) studies suggest binding of several putative sites in Notch pathway gene promoters to in vitro translated β-catenin/Lef-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild type</z:mp> (wt)-Apc negatively regulates β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By induction of wt-Apc or β-catenin silencing in HT29 cells, we observed that several genes in the Notch pathway, including Notch-2, were downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, active Notch signaling was verified in the Apc(Min/+) mouse model where Hes-1 mRNA levels were found significantly upregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Luciferase assays showed an increased activity for the core and proximal Notch-2 promoter upon co-transfection of HCT116 cells with high expression recombinant Tcf-4, Lef-1 or β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we identified Notch-2 as a novel target for β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore our data supports the notion that additional genes in the Notch pathway might be transcriptionally regulated by Wnt signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
