<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After surgical resection, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> recurrences have been related to the presence of micrometastases, potentially accessible to a high dose chemotherapy administered via adjuvant isolated lung perfusion (ILP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine in vitro the most efficient drug when administered to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines during a short exposure and in vivo its immediate and delayed tolerance when administered via ILP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First, efficacy of various cytotoxic molecules against a panel of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines was tested in vitro using cytotoxic assay after a 30-minute exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, early (operative) and delayed (1 month) tolerance of two concentrations of the molecule administered via ILP was tested on 19 adult pigs using hemodynamic, biological and histological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> (GEM) was the most efficient drug against selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo, GEM was administered via ILP at regular (20 µg/ml) or high (100 µg/ml) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GEM administration was associated with transient and dose-dependant pulmonary vasoconstriction, leading to a voluntary decrease in pump inflow in order to maintain a stable pulmonary artery pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After this modulation, ILP using GEM was not associated with any systemic leak, systemic damage, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or delayed histological pulmonary toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics studies revealed dose-dependant uptake associated with heterogenous distribution of the molecule into the lung parenchyma, and persistent cytotoxicity of venous effluent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GEM is effective against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells even after a short exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ILP with GEM is a safe and reproducible technique </plain></SENT>
