<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>'Mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e>' (MCC) is emerging as a multifunctional protein that affects several cellular processes and pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the MCC gene is rarely mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, it is frequently silenced through promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the closely linked MCC and APC loci in both colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APC promoter methylation is a marker of poor survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, MCC methylation has not been previously studied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we wanted to determine if MCC is silenced through promoter methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and whether this methylation is associated with LOH of the MCC locus or methylation of the APC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three polymorphic markers for the APC/MCC locus were analysed for LOH in 64 NSCLC specimens and matching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation of both genes was determined using methylation specific PCR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LOH of the three markers was found in 41-49% of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LOH within the MCC locus was less common in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) (29%) than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) (72%; P=0.006) or large cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e>) (75%; P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this LOH was not accompanied by MCC promoter methylation, which was found in only two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 39% of the specimens showed APC methylation, which was more common in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (58%) than in <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Western blotting revealed that MCC was expressed in a subset of lung tissue specimens but there was marked variation between patients rather than between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and matching non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have shown that promoter methylation of the APC gene does not extend to the neighbouring MCC gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, but LOH is found at both loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The variable levels of MCC expression were not associated with promoter methylation and may be regulated through other cellular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
