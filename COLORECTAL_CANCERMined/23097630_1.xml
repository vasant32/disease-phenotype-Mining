<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The α(v)β(3) integrin, highly overexpressed on newly formed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vessels, has been successfully used as a target for Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-functionalized nanoparticle contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, an RGD-functionalized nanocarrier was used to image ongoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in two different xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> models with varying intensities of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> (LS174T &gt; EW7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To that end, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="52529">nanocrystals</z:chebi> were included in the core of the nanoparticles to provide contrast for T(2)*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas the fluorophore Cy7 was attached to the surface to enable near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> models were used to test the potential of the nanoparticle probe in combination with dual modality imaging for in vivo detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-contrast and post-contrast images (4 hours) were acquired at a 9.4-T MRI system and revealed significant differences in the nanoparticle accumulation patterns between the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of the highly vascularized LS174T <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the accumulation was more confined to the periphery of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, where <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is predominantly occurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NIRF imaging revealed significant differences in accumulation kinetics between the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this technology can serve as an in vivo biomarker for antiangiogenesis treatment and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> phenotyping </plain></SENT>
