<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic and epigenetic alterations of APC may therefore be associated with dietary and lifestyle risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of APC mutations in the extended mutation cluster region (codons 1276-1556) and APC promoter 1A methylation was performed on 185 archival <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples collected from participants of the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EPIC)-Norfolk study, with the aim of relating these to high-quality seven-day dietary and lifestyle data collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Truncating APC mutations (APC(+) ) and promoter 1A methylation (PM(+) ) were identified in 43% and 23% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> analysed, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were more likely than proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> to be APC(+) or PM(+) (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APC(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were more likely to be moderately/well differentiated and microsatellite stable than APC(-) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (p = 0.05 and 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APC(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases consumed more alcohol than their counterparts (p = 0.01) and PM(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases consumed lower levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and fibre (p = 0.01 and 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APC(+) or PM(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases consumed higher levels of processed meat and iron from red meat and red meat products (p = 0.007 and 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases harbouring GC-to-AT transition mutations consumed higher levels of processed meat (35 versus 24 g/day, p = 0.04) and iron from red meat and red meat products (0.8 versus 0.6 mg/day, p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex and cigarette-smoking status, each 19 g/day (1SD) increment increase in processed meat consumption was associated with cases with GC-to-AT mutations (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.03-2.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, APC(+) and PM(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> may be influenced by diet and GC-to-AT mutations in APC are associated with processed meat consumption, suggesting a mechanistic link with dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, such as N-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35800">nitroso compounds</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
