<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the perioperative change of serum CEA to elucidate its prognostic effect in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: We reviewed patients who received curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during 2000 and 2004 at Taipei Veterans General Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum CEA level at diagnosis and one month after curative surgery were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels higher than 5ng/mL were defined as abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We divided patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> preoperative CEA level into two groups depending on the perioperative change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were analyzed with clinicopathological factors and disease free survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with stage I to III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, there were 738 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> preoperative CEA level (55.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with increased post-operative CEA than pre-operative ones had higher percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (p=0.007) and more lymphovascular invasion (p=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides they also had higher disease recurrent rate (p=0.032) and worse disease-free survival (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, perioperative CEA change, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion depth remained independent prognostic factors (p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When preoperative CEA level is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, perioperative change is a prognostic factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
