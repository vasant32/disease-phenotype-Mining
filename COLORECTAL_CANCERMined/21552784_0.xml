<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The Singapore <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Polyposis</z:e> Registry (SPR) was established in 1989 at the Singapore General Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This initiative was aimed at providing a central registry service to facilitate identification, surveillance and management of families and individuals at high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to provide a comprehensive review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) syndrome in the SPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with FAP in 1989-2009 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data was extracted from a prospectively collected database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 122 patients from 88 families were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age of this cohort was 29 (range 10-68) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>97 percent of the cases were FAP and 3 percent were attenuated FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>92 patients tested positive for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>42 percent of patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, of which 78 percent were diagnosed at an advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>73 percent of patients underwent restorative proctocolectomy and 21 percent had total colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median age at operation was 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At median follow-up of 98 months, ten-year overall survival was 75.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval 67.0-84.2) and the median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases, the overall recurrence was 13.5 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recurrence and disease-free survival were not significant for the type of surgery performed (p-value is 0.486) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The SPR plays an important and integral part in counselling patients and families with FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Improved surveillance programmes may be required to detect the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in these patients at an earlier stage </plain></SENT>
