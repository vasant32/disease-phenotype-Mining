<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B is frequently repressed in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> by aberrant DNA hypermethylation of its distal promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the epigenome level, DNMT3B promoter hypermethylation was associated with the hypomethylation of gene promoters usually hypermethylated in the healthy colon </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show a new molecular mechanism of aberrant DNMT3B regulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and suggest that its expression is associated with the methylation of constitutively hypermethylated promoters in the healthy colon </plain></SENT>
