<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We modeled acquired resistance to the MEK1/2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2) inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines harboring mutations in BRAF (COLO205 and HT29 lines) or KRAS (HCT116 and LoVo lines) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AZD6244-resistant derivatives were refractory to AZD6244-induced cell cycle arrest and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and exhibited a marked increase in ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2) pathway signaling and cyclin D1 abundance when assessed in the absence of inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic sequencing revealed no acquired mutations in MEK1 or MEK2, the primary target of AZD6244 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rather, resistant lines showed a marked up-regulation of their respective driving oncogenes, BRAF(600E) or KRAS(13D), due to intrachromosomal amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of BRAF reversed resistance to AZD6244 in COLO205 cells, which suggested that combined inhibition of MEK1/2 and BRAF may reduce the likelihood of acquired resistance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with BRAF(600E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of KRAS reversed AZD6244 resistance in HCT116 cells as well as reduced the activation of ERK1/2 and protein kinase B; however, the combined inhibition of ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling had little effect on AZD6244 resistance, suggesting that additional KRAS effector pathways contribute to this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis identified increased expression of an 18-gene signature previously identified as reflecting MEK1/2 pathway output in resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, amplification of the driving oncogene (BRAF(600E) or KRAS(13D)) can drive acquired resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors by increasing signaling through the ERK1/2 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, up-regulation of KRAS(13D) leads to activation of multiple KRAS effector pathways, underlining the therapeutic challenge posed by KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results may have implications for the use of combination therapies </plain></SENT>
