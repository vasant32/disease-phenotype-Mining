<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in peripheral blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and to present strategies for early detection screen test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty seven patients in non-metastatic stage and 27 healthy individuals were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of CEA, hTERT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and 18srRNA (18s subunit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi>, as reference gene) were determined based on real-time RT-PCR on 3 µg of total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from blood in 3 separate vials (1 µg per vial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive expression rate of CEA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (78%) and hTERT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (81%) were higher in patient group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These rates were meaningfully higher than the results of individual vials containing only 1 µg of total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Difference between Ct values of markers with 18srRNA ΔCt) was higher in healthy group than patient one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a ΔCt cut-off value was determined for distinguishing between true- and false-positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concurrent expression of both markers was found in 67% of the patients, which was higher than healthy cases (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combination of concurrent marker expression with cut-off point strategy increased specificity to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results showed that concurrent evaluation of marker expression and performing the test on 3 µg of samples in 3 separate vials may increase specificity and sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR for early detection of non-metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, more investigations with larger numbers of samples are needed to verify these results </plain></SENT>
