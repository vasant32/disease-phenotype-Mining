<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were searched and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the immunological difference between LS and OS were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two authors extracted data and assessed trial quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven studies including 695 patients were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immune-competent cells demonstrated no significant differences between LS and OS in six trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight trials assessed various perioperative plasma cytokine concentrations with no significant differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels between LS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, meta-analysis showed higher T suppressor lymphocytes (CD8+) counts on postoperative days (POD) 1-3 and lower plasma levels of CRP on POD 0-1 in LS group compared with OS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although LS groups displayed higher T suppressor lymphocyte (CD8+) counts on postoperative days (POD) 1-3 and lower plasma levels of CRP on POD 0-1, there is no sufficient evidence to support superior preservation of global immune function with LS compared to OS </plain></SENT>
