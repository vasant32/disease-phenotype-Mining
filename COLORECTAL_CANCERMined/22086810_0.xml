<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine how often primary care physicians address patient-level health behavioral constructs that are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening and whether physician counseling addressing constructs is associated with favorable changes in patients' attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and subsequent screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients eligible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and attending routine appointments within two academic primary care clinics (50 patients, 20 primary care clinicians) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients completed validated measures of behavioral constructs associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (benefits, barriers, susceptibility, self-efficacy, intention, and stage of readiness) before and after their visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Audio-recorded discussions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were coded for conversation addressing constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bivariate and regression analyses estimated associations between discussions that did and did not address constructs and, after the visit, measures of perceived benefits, barriers, susceptibility, self-efficacy, intention, and completion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physicians discussed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening during 38 encounters (76%) and addressed behavioral constructs during 26 (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to visits without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussion, visits with discussion were associated with increased perceived susceptibility (β = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.09-0.68) and screening intention (β = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.11-0.73) after the visit but no significant change in perceived benefits, barriers, or self-efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within 6 months, 17 of 38 patients (45%) who discussed screening completed screening compared with 0 of 12 patients who did not discuss screening (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associations between discussions and outcomes were similar whether or not counseling addressed behavioral constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that physician counseling is associated with increased patient perception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility, greater screening intention, and completion of screening regardless of whether counseling addresses behavioral constructs </plain></SENT>
