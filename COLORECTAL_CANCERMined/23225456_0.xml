<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 68 patients treated between 1998 and 2007 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 60 patients who had no simultaneous liver-directed procedure (LDP), the best results obtained were complete response in two patients (3%), partial response in 18 patients (30%), and stable disease in 23 patients (38%), for an overall disease control rate of 72% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 11 months, and median survival was 24 months </plain></SENT>
