<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">Haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) levels and red blood cell transfusion requirements were evaluated among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> in 11 European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a target Hb level of ≥10-≤12 g/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The full analysis set included 1887 patients (mean ± SD 62.4 ± 11.4 years); 1585 (84%) had a current disease stage of ≥3 </plain></SENT>
