<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The growing demand for colonoscopies and inappropriate colonoscopies have become a significant problem for health care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the appropriateness of colonoscopies and to analyze the association with some clinical and organizational factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To compare the results of the European Panel of Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (EPAGE) and the EPAGE-II criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Endoscopy unit of a teaching hospital in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients referred for colonoscopy, excluding urgent, therapeutic indications, and poor cleansing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Appropriateness of colonoscopies according to the EPAGE criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 749 colonoscopies, 619 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients were referred by gastroenterologists (66.1%) in an outpatient setting (80.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>Hematochezia</z:hpo> was the most frequent indication (31.5%) followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-related indications (27.3%); a clinically relevant diagnosis was established in 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate use was higher with EPAGE (27.0%) than EPAGE-II (17.4%) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surveillance after colonic polypectomy and uncomplicated lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> were the indications exhibiting higher inadequacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate use was less with older age, in hospitalized patients, with referrals from internal medicine, and in colonoscopies with clinically relevant diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Agreement between EPAGE and EPAGE-II was fair (weighted κ = 0.31) but improved to moderate (simple κ = 0.60) after grouping appropriate and uncertain levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The appropriateness criteria are based on panel opinions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Some patients (12%) could not be evaluated with the EPAGE criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies substantial colonoscopy overuse, especially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> disease surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The EPAGE-II criteria decrease the inappropriate rate and the possibility of overlooking potentially severe lesions </plain></SENT>
