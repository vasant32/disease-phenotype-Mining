<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional polymorphisms of ADH1B, ADH1C, and ALDH2 genes occur among racial populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to systematically determine the functional expressions and cellular localization of ADHs and ALDHs in human rectal mucosa, the lesions of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoid</z:e>, and the genetic association of allelic variations of ADH and ALDH with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one surgical specimens of <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and the adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, including 16 paired tissues of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumor</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosae of rectum and sigmoid colon from the same individuals, and 18 surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mixed hemorrhoid</z:e> specimens and leukocyte DNA samples from 103 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, 67 hemorrhoid patients, and 545 control subjects recruited in previous study, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The isozyme/allozyme expression patterns of ADH and ALDH were identified by isoelectric focusing and the activities were assayed spectrophotometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein contents of ADH/ALDH isozymes were determined by immunoblotting using the corresponding purified class-specific antibodies; the cellular activity and protein localizations were detected by immunohistochemistry and histochemistry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotypes of ADH1B, ADH1C, and ALDH2 were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 33mM <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, pH 7.5, the activity of ADH1C*1/1 phenotypes exhibited 87% higher than that of the ADH1C*1/*2 phenotypes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activity of ALDH2-active phenotypes of rectal mucosa was 33% greater than ALDH2-inactive phenotypes at 200μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15343,43923">acetaldehyde</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protein contents in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rectal mucosa were in the following order: ADH1&gt;ALDH2&gt;ADH3≈ALDH1A1, whereas those of ADH2, ADH4, and ALDH3A1 were fairly low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both activity and content of ADH1 were significantly decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e>, whereas the ALDH activity remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ADH activity was also significantly reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ADH4 and ALDH3A1 were uniquely expressed in the squamous epithelium of anus at anorectal junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies of ADH1C*1 and ALDH2*2 were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and that of ALDH2*2 also significantly greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ADH and ALDH isozymes are differentially expressed in mucosal cells of rectum and anus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15343,43923">acetaldehyde</z:chebi>, an immediate metabolite of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, may play an etiological role in pathogenesis of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
