<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We examine the relationships between geographic remoteness, area disadvantage and risk of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multilevel models were used to assess the area- and individual-level contributions to the risk of advanced disease among people aged 20-79 years diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Queensland, Australia between 1997 and 2007 (n=18,561) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multilevel analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients living in inner regional (OR=1.09, 1.01-1.19) and outer regional (OR=1.11, 1.01-1.22) areas were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> than those in major cities (P=0.045) after adjusting for individual-level variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The best-fitting final model did not include area disadvantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis suggested this remoteness effect was limited to people diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (P=0.048) and not significant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients (P=0.873) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Given the relationship between stage and survival outcomes, it is imperative that the reasons for these rurality inequities in advanced disease be identified and addressed </plain></SENT>
