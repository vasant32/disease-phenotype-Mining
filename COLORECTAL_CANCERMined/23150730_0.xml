<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Appropriate use of genetic tests for population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, diagnosis of inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and guidance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment can improve health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated clinicians' use and knowledge of eight breast, ovarian, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> genetic tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized survey of 2,191 Oregon providers, asking about their experience with fecal DNA, OncoVue, BRCA, MMR, CYP2D6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> gene expression profiling, UGT1A1, and KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinicians reported low confidence in their knowledge of medical genetics; most confident were OB-GYNs and specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinicians were more likely to have ordered/recommended BRCA and MMR than the other tests, and OB-GYNs were twice as likely to have ordered/recommended BRCA testing than primary care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Less than 10% of providers ordered/recommended OncoVue, fecal DNA, CYP2D6, or UGT1A1; less than 30% ordered/recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> gene expression profiles or KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common reason for not ordering/recommending these tests was lack of familiarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Use of appropriate, evidence-based testing can help reduce incidence and mortality of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, but these tests need to be better integrated into clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Continued evaluation of emerging technologies, dissemination of findings, and an increase in provider confidence and knowledge are necessary to achieve this end </plain></SENT>
