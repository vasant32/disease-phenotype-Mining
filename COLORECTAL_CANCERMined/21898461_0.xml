<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a proof-of-principle study to evaluate the feasibility of using MPM to make real-time noninvasive optical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by investigating 30 fresh, unfixed, and unstained full-thickness colorectal specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that MPM images demonstrated irregular tubular structures, reduced stroma, and cellular and nuclear pleomorphism in the cancerous tissues </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings showed that MPM had the potential to make real-time noninvasive optical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With miniaturization and integration of colonoscopy, MPM has a promising future in real-time noninvasive "optical biopsy" for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
