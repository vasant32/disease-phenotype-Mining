<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh tissue samples from 37 patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were analyzed for MAGE and SSX <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and their paraffin-embedded tissues were used for immunohistochemistry for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and survivin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of MAGE and SSX was not detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon cancer</z:hpo> expressed SSX in 32.4% and MAGE in 51.4% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Co-expression of MAGE and SSX was directly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (p=0.024) and also correlated with nuclear expression of survivin (p=0.016), yet did not correlate with expression of COX2 and VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear survivin expression (83.3%) was found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues exclusively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant relationships between the expression of COX2 (73.9%) and VEGF (72.4%) and other clinicopathologic variables were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that nuclear expression of survivin, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, vascular and perineural invasion, and co-expression of MAGE and SSX may be associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to the liver </plain></SENT>
