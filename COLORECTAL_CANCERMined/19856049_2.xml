<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In July 2006, a questionnaire was sent to 49 institutions affiliated with the JCOG-CCSG to gather information on numbers of cases, therapeutic modalities, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The target subjects were patients with stages II/III ASCC, diagnosed from January 2000 to December 2004, who were 20-80 years of age with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> major organ function and no severe complications </plain></SENT>
