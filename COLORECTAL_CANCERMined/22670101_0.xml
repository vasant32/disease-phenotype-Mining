<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the perceptions of gastroenterologists and general surgeons with respect to screening practices for patients with hereditary crc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We surveyed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gastroenterologists and general surgeons in NL to determine demographic and professional practice characteristics and screening knowledge, practices, and attitudes for four groups of patients with hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 43 eligible physicians, 36 (83.7%) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the physicians surveyed knew the correct age to start screening, preferred screening by colonoscopy, had a systematic means in their own practice of prioritizing patients for screening, and felt that family doctors or patients (or both) should be responsible for monitoring screening compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most physicians reported that patients with hereditary nonpolyposis <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> waited 3 months for screening; patients with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> waited 6 months or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although respondents agreed on the need for a province-wide <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> registry [4.36 on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree)], they disagreed that wait times were reasonable (2.81) and that other health professionals should perform colonoscopies (2.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were equivocal about the need for centralized bookings (3.25) and about whether genetic testing is useful for prioritizing patients (3.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gastroenterologists and general surgeons in NL were knowledgeable about screening, but had varying opinions about individual roles in screening, wait times, and the means for prioritizing and providing screening for patients with hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
