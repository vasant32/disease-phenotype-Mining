<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considerations to support screening in an individual patient are not clearly described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is limited data to support recommendations in African American (AA) and Hispanics population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed records of 568 inpatient colonoscopies carried out at our Mt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sinai Hospital Medical Center, Chicago during 2006-2008 for symptomatic adults ≥75 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with previous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> screening colonoscopies and presence of one or more "generally indicated" indications as per American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 155 adults (mean age, 81.8 years; 29% males and 71% females; 83.8% AAs and 16.1% Hispanics) met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine percent had one previous colonoscopy, whereas 21% of the patients had two or more previous colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Common indications for a repeat colonoscopy were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> 69.7%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo> 39.4%, and fecal occult blood 19.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was completed to the cecum in 65.2% of the subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection rate was 14/155 (9%), of which 9/14 (75%) were staged III/IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two (1.3%) patients had complications which resolved conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symptomatic AAs and Hispanics ≥75 have a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> despite a previous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> and high comorbidity/low life expectancy limit the benefit of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
