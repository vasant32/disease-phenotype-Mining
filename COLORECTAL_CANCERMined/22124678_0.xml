<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stenting has emerged as an alternative to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare short-term morbidity, mortality and hospital stay between treatment with self-expandable metallic stent and emergency surgery performed at our department during a 5-year period in a non-randomized setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235328" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic obstruction</z:e> due to rectal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> referred to the Endoscopic Unit or Surgical Department for insertion of a colonic stent between 1 August 2003 and 1 August 2008 were prospectively registered and followed (n = 112) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A control group was identified using the hospital records of operations with the International Classification Code-10 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (n = 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, indication, preoperative investigations, surgical procedure, complications and procedure-related mortality were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed in accordance with local guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The complication rate was similar in the two groups, although there was a trend toward a higher number of severe complications in the surgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hospital stay was significantly lower in the stent group, median of 4 vs. 9 days (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The procedure-related mortality was lower in the stent group; 7% vs. 20% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stenting can be safely performed with lower or similar complication rate and lower mortality rate compared to surgery and results in significantly shorter hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results support stenting as the treatment of choice in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235328" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic obstruction</z:e>, especially in disseminated disease </plain></SENT>
