<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A diet rich in legumes is directly related to the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, showing an inverse relationship with the development of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in human subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study shows the results of molecular changes involved in the Tp53 pathway at an early stage in the distal colon tissue of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in rats evaluated by PCR array after exposure to diets containing the non-digestible fraction (NDF) of cooked bean (cultivar Bayo Madero) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were detected in seventy-two genes of the Tp53-mediated signalling pathway involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell-cycle regulation and arrest, inhibition of proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tp53, Gadd45a, Cdkn1a and Bax were highly expressed (9·3-, 18·3-, 5·5- and 3·5-fold, respectively) in the NDF+AOM group, whereas Cdc25c, Ccne2, E2f1 and Bcl2 were significantly suppressed ( - 9·2-, - 2·6-, - 18·4- and - 3·5-fold, respectively), among other genes, compared with the AOM group, suggesting that chemoprevention of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> results from a combination of cell-cycle arrest in G1/S and G2/M phases and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by apoptotic induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the NDF from common bean modulates gene expression profiles in the colon tissue of AOM-induced rats, contributing to the chemoprotective effect of common bean on early-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
