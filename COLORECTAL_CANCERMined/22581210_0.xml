<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TNF-α levels (measured by immunoassay) and abnormalities in the APC system [evaluated by an APC-dependent thrombin generation assay (ThromboPath-ThP)] were evaluated in 45 mCRC patients undergoing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VTE events were recorded during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TNF-α levels were increased (p &lt; 0.01), and APC functionality was decreased (p &lt; 0.0001) in mCRC patients compared to age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was observed between TNF-α and APC impairment in mCRC (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-α was confirmed as an independent predictor (p = 0.007) for APC abnormalities at multivariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine (20 %) of 45 mCRC patients experienced VTE during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bayesian analysis of combined ThP/TNF-α showed a positive predictive value of 0.67 in predicting VTE (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards survival analysis confirmed the predictive value of combined ThP/TNF-α determination in VTE risk assessment of mCRC patients (either negative vs. both positive: HR = 0.02; p = 0.001), and Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that mCRC patients with either negative TNF-α or ThP values prior to chemotherapy were less likely to experience VTE (13 %) than patients with abnormalities of both markers (67 %, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the host <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived cytokines could be responsible for an impairment of the APC system and a switch toward a pro-thrombotic state, which might predispose to the occurrence of VTE in mCRC patients undergoing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
