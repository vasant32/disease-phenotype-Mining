<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chemopreventive efficacy of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, long-term use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> is precluded owing to potentially fatal toxicities associated with their mechanism of action involving cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But studies have shown that their anticancer activity may be due, in part, to an off-target effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which are responsible for negative regulation of cGMP signaling, are an attractive COX-independent target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cGMP signaling is aberrantly suppressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and its activation appears to be sufficient to inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemically modifying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> has produced a series of new derivatives that lack COX-inhibitory activity but have improved cGMP PDE inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach is proving to be a promising strategy for the discovery of improved agents for the prevention and/or treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
