<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (CTC) in blood have attracted attention both as potential seeds for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and as biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most CTC detection systems might miss epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-induced metastatic cells because detection is based on epithelial markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, to discover novel markers capable of detecting CTCs in which EMT has not been repressed, microarray analysis of 132 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) from Japanese patients was conducted, and 2,969 genes were detected that were overexpressed relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the detected genes, we selected those that were overexpressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, we analyzed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-specific genes (n = 22) to determine whether they were expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, PLS3 was discovered as a CTC marker that was expressed in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using fluorescent immunocytochemistry, we validated that PLS3 was expressed in EMT-induced CTC in peripheral blood from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PLS3-expressing cells were detected in the peripheral blood of approximately one-third of an independent set of 711 Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that PLS3-positive CTC was independently associated with prognosis in the training set (n = 381) and the validation set [n = 330; HR = 2.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.38-3.40 and HR = 3.92; 95% CI = 2.27-6.85] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between PLS3-positive CTC and prognosis was particularly strong in patients with Dukes B (HR = 4.07; 95% CI = 1.50-11.57) and Dukes C (HR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.42-4.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PLS3 is a novel marker for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, and it possesses significant prognostic value </plain></SENT>
