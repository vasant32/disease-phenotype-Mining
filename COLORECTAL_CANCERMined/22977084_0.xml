<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though the guidelines state that 12 should be the minimum, there is ongoing concern that this might not be enough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, many studies have shown that this cut-off is far from universally obtained in many surgical series, whether via laparotomy or via laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arguments in favor of sticking to the cutoff value of 12 are weak: certainly, culling and examining as many lymph nodes as possible should increase the chances of correct staging and the consequent therapeutic consequences, decrease local recurrence and, perhaps, also increase survival (although this is not the direct consequence of gathering and examining as many lymph nodes as possible) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopy should be no different from open surgery: the same rational prevails for laparoscopic oncologic clearance to increase patient well-being and ensure good practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>What is most important, however, is to make surgeons and pathologists realize that this issue is important and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of us should strive, in close collaboration, to achieve these goals, for the good of the patient, the person for whom the lymph node count counts most </plain></SENT>
