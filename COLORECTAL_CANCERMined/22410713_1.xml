<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of cholecystectomy and the risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies to explore this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified studies by a literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE through 30 September 2011, and by searching the reference lists of pertinent articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Summary relative risks (SRRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was assessed using Cochran's Q statistic and the I2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 10 studies (including 4061 CRA cases) were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these 10 studies found that no effect of cholecystectomy on the risk of CRAs was shown (SRR, 1.17; 95% CI: 0.93-1.48), with no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among these studies (P <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>=0.106, I2=37.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This null association was seen in both men and women (men: SRR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.58-1.73; women: SRR=1.39, 95% CI: 0.95-2.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that there is no positive association between previous cholecystectomy and the risk of CRA development in both men and women </plain></SENT>
