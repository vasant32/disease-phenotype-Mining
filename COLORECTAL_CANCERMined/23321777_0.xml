<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this review is to assess the predictive value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with cetuximab and panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched PubMed and ASCO Meetings for publications reporting the correlation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> with survival and/or response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals for progression and/or survival, and/or risk ratios (RRs) for response rate in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> were obtained from publications and pooled in a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen publications (for a total of 3,833 patients) were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> represents a predictive factor for survival (HR 0.51; p &lt; 0.00001) and progression (HR 0.58; p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients who developed moderate or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> had an increased chance of response (35 vs 13 %; RR 2.23, p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> during treatment with cetuximab and panitumumab represents a significant predictor of the efficacy of these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that, in patients who lack substantial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e>, this treatment is not beneficial and requires early discontinuation deserves further study </plain></SENT>
