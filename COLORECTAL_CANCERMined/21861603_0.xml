<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether variants in the MEK5 gene promoter were involved in susceptivity of individuals to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present hospital-based case-control study of 737 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 703 healthy control subjects in a southern Chinese population, the two polymorphisms of MEK5 promoter (i.e., rs7172582C&gt;T and rs3743354T&gt;C) were genotyped by TaqMan assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between cases and controls in the genotype and allele distribution of the MEK5 gene rs3743354T&gt;C polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rs3743354 CC genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> when compared with the TT genotype (adjusted odds ratios [ORs]=0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the T allele, a significant correlation was detected between the presence of the C allele and decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (adjusted OR=0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> associated with rs3743354 variant genotypes (i.e., CT+CC) was found in the smoker subgroup (adjusted OR=0.63; 95% CI=0.45-0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, environmental factors, including smoking and drinking, interacted with rs3743354C variant genotypes to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that the levels of MEK5 protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> neoplastic tissues and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal epithelium tissues were lower in the carriers of rs3743354 CC genotypes than that in those with rs3743354 TT genotypes or those with rs3743354 TC genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no significant association was found between the rs7172582C&gt;T polymorphism and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the rs3743354 polymorphism in the MEK5 promoter may affect the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
