<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten thousand four hundred ninety four patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> underwent colorectal resection from Taiwan <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Database during 2003 to 2005 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included those patients with stage IV disease or without number information of lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the definition of risk groups, the method of classification and regression tree was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main primary outcome was 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified six prognostic factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival, resulting in seven terminal nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four risk groups were defined as following: Group 1 (mild risk, 1,698 patients), Group 2 (moderate risk, 3,129 patients), Group 3 (high risk, 4,605 patients) and Group 4 (very high risk, 1,062 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival for Group 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 86.6%, 62.7%, 55.9%, and 36.6%, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 2.13, 5.52 and 10.56 (95% confidence interval 1.74-2.60, 4.58-6.66 and 8.66-12.9, respectively) times for Group 2, 3, and 4 as compared to Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The predictive capability of these grouping was also similar in terms of overall and progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of RPA offered an alternative grouping method that could predict the survival of patients who underwent surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
