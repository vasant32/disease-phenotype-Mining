<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is particularly important for patients with early-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that shedding of the extracellular domain of ALCAM (Activated Leukocyte Cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> Molecule) is prognostic for outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous reports on the prognostic value of ALCAM expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have been contradictory and inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study clarifies the prognostic value of ALCAM by visualizing ectodomain shedding using a dual stain that detects both the extracellular and the intracellular domains in formalin-fixed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this novel assay, 105 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> patients and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa samples were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ALCAM shedding, defined as detection of the intracellular domain in the absence of the corresponding extracellular domain, was significantly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and correlated with reduced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, retention of intact ALCAM was associated with improved survival, thereby confirming that ALCAM shedding is associated with poor patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, analysis of stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients demonstrated that disease-specific survival is significantly reduced for patients with elevated ALCAM shedding (p=0.01, HR 3.0) suggesting that ALCAM shedding can identify patients with early stage disease at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
