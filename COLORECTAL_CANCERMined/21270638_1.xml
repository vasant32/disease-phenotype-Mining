<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Using a large, retrospective cohort from the Utah Population Database, we assess how well family history predicts who will acquire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during a 20-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals were selected between ages 35 and 80 with no prior record of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis, as of the year 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-affected relatives and diagnosis ages were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Familial relative risk and absolute risk estimates were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnoses in the cohort were counted between years 1986 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression and Harrell's C were used to measure the discriminatory power of resulting models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 431,153 individuals were included with 5,334 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Familial relative risk ranged from 0.83 to 12.39 and 20-year absolute risk from 0.002 to 0.21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With familial relative risk as the only predictor, Harrell's C = 0.53 and with age only, Harrell's C = 0.66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Familial relative risk combined with age produced a Harrell's C = 0.67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Family history by itself is not a strong predictor of exactly who will acquire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> within 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, stratification of risk using absolute risk probabilities may be more helpful in focusing screening on individuals who are more likely to develop the disease </plain></SENT>
