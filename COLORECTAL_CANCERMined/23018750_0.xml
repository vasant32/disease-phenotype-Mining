<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2005 California Health Interview Survey to ascertain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening test use and to estimate the prevalence of health behaviors that may reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to control for demographic factors and health-care access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with a family history of breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> were more likely to be up to date with mammography as compared with women with no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (odds ratio = 1.69, 95% confidence interval (1.39, 2.04)); their health behaviors were similar to other women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men and women with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were more likely to be up to date with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening as compared with individuals with no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (odds ratio = 2.77, 95% confidence interval (2.20, 3.49)) but were less likely to have a body mass index &lt;25 kg/m(2) (odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (0.67, 0.94)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ConcluSION: Innovative methods are needed to encourage those with a moderate-to-strong familial risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to increase their physical activity levels, strive to maintain a healthy weight, quit smoking, and reduce alcohol use </plain></SENT>
