<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Candidate hypermethylated genes screened by MIRA-based microarrays were further validated in independent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 297 CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> covering 211 genes were found to be hypermethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these 211 candidate methylated genes, three novel hypermethylated genes with more than four probes positive were picked up for validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing revealed that methylations occurred at multiple CpG sites of these three genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues, especially for PHOX2B and FGF12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> restriction analysis showed that these three genes were methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples but not in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also compared the methylation levels of these three novel hypermethylated genes with those of vimentin and SEPT9, well-known hypermethylated genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and found that methylated PHOX2B, FGF12 and GAD2 were better than methylated vimentin and SEPT9 in differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue from non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant enrichment analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> terms of the hypermethylated genes showed that a high proportion of hypermethylated genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues are involved in the regulation of transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found a set of novel hypermethylated genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which may have potential to be used as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
