<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Probiotic bacteria produce immunoregulatory metabolites in vitro such as conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> (CLA), a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> with potent anti-carcinogenic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of probiotic bacteria in mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The immune modulatory mechanisms of VSL#3 probiotic bacteria and CLA were investigated in mouse models of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-driven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonic specimens were collected for histopathology, gene expression and flow cytometry analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immune cell subsets in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen and colonic lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) were phenotypically and functionally characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice treated with CLA or VSL#3 recovered faster from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory phase of disease and had lower disease severity in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing phase of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> formation was also diminished by both treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VSL#3 increased the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TNF-α, angiostatin and PPAR γ whereas CLA decreased COX-2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, VSL#3-treated mice had increased IL-17 expression in MLN CD4+ T cells and accumulation of Treg LPL and memory CD4+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both CLA and VSL#3 suppressed colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, although VSL#3 showed greater anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activities than CLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, CLA modulated expression of COX-2 levels in the colonic mucosa, whereas VSL#3 targeted regulatory mucosal CD4+ T cell responses </plain></SENT>
