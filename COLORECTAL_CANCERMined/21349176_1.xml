<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Interactions between CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 have been shown to be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a comparative CXCL12/CXCR4 expression analysis and assessed the effect of external CXCL12 stimulation on migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells without and with CXCR4 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of CXCL12/CXCR4 was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA and immunohistochemistry in resection specimens of 50 CRC patients as well as in the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and in three human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines with different metastatic potential (Caco-2, SW480 and HT-29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Migration assays were performed after stimulation with CXCL12 and CXCR4 was inhibited by siRNA and neutralizing antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues CXCL12 was significantly down-regulated and CXCR4 was significantly up-regulated compared to the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cell lines CXCR4 was predominantly expressed in SW480 and less pronounced in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CXCL12 was only detectable in Caco-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CXCL12 stimulation had no impact on Caco-2 cells but significantly increased migration of CXCR4 bearing SW480 and HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was significantly abrogated by neutralizing anti-CXCR4 antibody as well as by CXCR4 siRNAs (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CXCR4 expression was up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and CXCL12 stimulation increased migration in CXCR4 bearing cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Migration was inhibited by both neutralizing CXCR4 antibodies and CXCR4 siRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the expression and functionality of CXCR4 might be associated with the metastatic potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and CXCL12/CXCR4 interactions might therefore constitute a promising target for specific treatment interventions </plain></SENT>
