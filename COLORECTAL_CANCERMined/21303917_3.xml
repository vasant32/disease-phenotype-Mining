<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (ICD10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision) C18-C20) between 1996 and 2004 in England, Norway and Sweden were included in this population-based study of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were 5-year cumulative relative period of survival and excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates stratified by age and period of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The survival of English patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was significantly lower than was observed in both Norway and Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five-year age-standardised <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> relative survival was 51.1% (95% CI 50.1% to 52.0%) in England compared with 57.9% (95% CI 55.2% to 60.5%) in Norway and 59.9% (95% CI 57.7% to 62.0%) in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> survival was 52.3% (95% CI 51.1% to 53.5%) in England compared with 60.7% (95% CI 57.0% to 64.2%) and 59.8% (95% CI 56.9% to 62.6%) in Norway and Sweden, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lower survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in England was primarily due to a high number of excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among older patients in the first 3 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> remained elevated until 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the lower excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate in Norway applied in the English population, then 890 (13.6%) and 654 (16.8%) of the excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> populations, respectively, could have been prevented at 5 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of these avoidable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred shortly after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was significant variation in survival between the countries, with the English population experiencing a poorer outcome, primarily due to a relatively higher number of excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in older patients in the short term after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It seems likely, therefore, that in England a greater proportion of the population present with more rapidly fatal disease (especially in the older age groups) than in Norway or Sweden </plain></SENT>
