<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible trials were identified from Medline, Embase, Ovid, and the Cochrane database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed with fixed-effects or random-effects models using Review Manager version 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen nonrandomized studies with a total of 1431 participants were suitable for meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in overall morbidity and severe complications between the Bev + group and Bev - group (43.3% vs 36.8%, P = 0.06; 17.1% vs 11.4%, P = 0.07, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bev-related complications including wound and thromboembolic/<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events were also similar in the Bev + and Bev - groups (14.4% vs 8.1%, P = 0.21; 4.1% vs 3.8%, P = 0.98, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence and severity of sinusoidal dilation were lower in patients treated with Bev than in patients treated without Bev (43.3% vs 63.7%, P &lt; 0.001; 16.8% vs 46.5%, P &lt; 0.00, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bev can be safely administered before hepatic resection in patients with CLM, and has a protective effect against hepatic injury in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
