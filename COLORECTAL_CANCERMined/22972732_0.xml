<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population-based, retrospective study with individuals linked across administrative databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Survivors of breast (n = 11 219), colorectal (n = 4348), or endometrial (n = 3473) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, or Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) (n = 2071) matched to general population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survivors were those who had completed primary treatment and were on "well" follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study period was 4 years (1 to 5 years from the date of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Never versus ever screened (in the 4-year study period) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> and never versus ever received (during the study period) a periodic health examination; rates were compared between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Random effects models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors were never screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 40% were never screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors were never screened for breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> survivors were never screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and 66% were never screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> survivors were never screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, 77% were never screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and 32% were never screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comparison with matched controls showed a mixed picture, with breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> survivors more likely, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> survivors less likely, than controls to be screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is concern about the preventive care of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors despite frequent visits to both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> specialists and family physicians during the "well" follow-up period </plain></SENT>
