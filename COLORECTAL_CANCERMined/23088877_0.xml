<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increasing number of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing CTC for both evaluation of symptoms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, along with the growing availability of CTC facilities in most healthcare departments and imaging centres, requires that a sufficient number of radiologists be adequately trained in performing and interpreting CTC studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, optimal performance of CTC depends on a number of factors, including the quality of colonic preparation (e.g. <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> bowel cleansing and optimised colonic distension), the CTC image acquisition protocol used, and reading approach and specific skills of radiologists for correct detection and interpretation of colonic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, dedicated training and expertise is key to obtain high sensitivity in lesion detection and reduce the number of false positives, thus ensuring an optimal clinical management of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To this purpose, dedicated training programmes are essential to teach and standardise not only the approach to CTC reading, but also reporting of colonic findings </plain></SENT>
