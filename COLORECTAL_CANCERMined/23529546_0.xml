<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> have an overall decrease in the risk of developing colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> effects are yet to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> has been critically involved in inflammatory stress and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, this study was undertaken to investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>-induced DNA strand breaks, an important event leading to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>-elicited cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubation of φX-174 plasmid DNA with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> generator 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) led to the formation of both single- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> breaks in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> at 0.1 and 1.0 mM was found to significantly inhibit SIN-1-induced DNA strand breaks in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The consumption of oxygen induced by SIN-1 was found to not be affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> at 0.1-50 mM, indicating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> at these concentrations is not involved in the auto-oxidation of SIN-1 to form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is observed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> at 0.1-1 mM showed considerable inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>-mediated luminol chemiluminescence in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> is able to directly scavenge the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in combination with spin-trapping experiments, using 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxide</z:chebi> (DMPO) as spin trap resulting in the formation of DMPO-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> adduct from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> only at higher concentration (1 mM) inhibited the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> adduct while shifting EPR spectra, indicating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> at higher concentrations may generate a more stable free radical species rather than acting purely as a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies demonstrate for the first time that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> can potently inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>-mediated DNA strand breakage, scavenge <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, and affect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>-mediated radical formation, which may be responsible, at least partially, for its anti-inflammatory and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> effects </plain></SENT>
