<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence showed that common functional -31G&gt;C polymorphism (rs9904341 G&gt;C) in the promoter region of the survivin gene is involved in the regulation of survivin expression, thus increasing an individual's susceptibility to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>; but individually published results are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to derive a more precise estimation of the association between survivin -31G&gt;C polymorphism and GIT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and CBM databases was conducted from inception through July 1st, 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine case-control studies were included with a total of 2,231 GIT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 2,287 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that survivin -31G&gt;C polymorphism was associated with increased risk of GIT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the stratified analysis by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types, significant associations were observed between survivin -31G&gt;C polymorphism and increased risk of colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of association of survivin -31G&gt;C polymorphism with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> risk may be due to a lack of a sufficient number of eligible studies and the influence of different genetic and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results from the current meta-analysis suggests that survivin -31G&gt;C polymorphism might increase the risk of GIT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, especially among gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
