<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the prognostic factors in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> from colorectal origin, especially focusing on lymph node status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1998 and 2007, 126 patients who underwent surgical treatment for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> were retrospectively assessed concerning prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To estimate survival, we formulated a scoring system by numbers of independent poor prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to a multivariate analysis, extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-3.13; P = 0.008) and lymph node ratio (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.33; P = 0.034) were found to be independent poor prognostic factors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrated that score formulated by the number of these criteria was highly predictive of survival (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate for patients with score 0 (having no criteria), score 1 (having one criterion), and score 2 (having two criteria) were 25.1 per cent, 6.2 per cent, and 0 per cent, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymph node ratio is an important prognostic factor in addition to the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> after resection of primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients without these criteria have a favorable outcome, and therefore should be considered for further aggressive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
