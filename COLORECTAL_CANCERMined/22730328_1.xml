<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>O-GlcNAcylation is dynamically regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which are responsible for O-GlcNAc addition and removal, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although O-GlcNAcylation was found to play a significant role in several pathologies such as type II <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, the role of O-GlcNAcylation in the etiology and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> remains vague </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we followed O-GlcNAcylation and its catalytic machinery in metastatic clones of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the effect of OGA knockdown on <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> and on the transcriptome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> SW620 metastatic clone exhibited increased O-GlcNAcylation and decreased OGA expression compared with its primary clone, SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>O-GlcNAcylation elevation in SW620 cells, through <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference of OGA, resulted in phenotypic alterations that included acquisition of a fibroblast-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, which coincides with epithelial metastatic progression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis revealed that OGA silencing altered the expression of about 1300 genes, mostly involved in cell movement and growth, and specifically affected metabolic pathways of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and carbohydrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support the involvement of O-GlcNAcylation in various aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and suggest that this modification may serve as a link between metabolic changes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
