<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this limitation, we developed a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-microfluidic temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-μTGCE) platform for gene methylation analysis by combining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment and slantwise radiative heating system-based μTGCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi>-treated genomic DNA (gDNA) was amplified with universal primers for both methylated and unmethylated sequences, and introduced into glass microfluidic chip to perform electrophorectic separation under a continuous temperature gradient based on the formation of heteroduplexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight CDKN2A promoter model fragments with different number and location of methylation sites were prepared and successfully analyzed according to their electrophoretic peak patterns, with high stability, picoliter-scale sample consumption, and significantly increased detection speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-μTGCE could detect methylated gDNA with a detection limit of 7.5pg, and could distinguish as low as 0.1% methylation level in CDKN2A in an unmethylated background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection of seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines with known and unknown methylation statuses of CDKN2A promoter and 20 tumor tissues derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients demonstrated the capability of detecting hypermethylation in real-world samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The wider adaptation of this platform was further supported by the detection of the CDKN2A and MLH1 promoters' methylation statuses in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This highly sensitive, fast, and low-consumption platform for methylation detection shows great potential for future clinical applications </plain></SENT>
