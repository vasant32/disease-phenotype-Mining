<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the association of nutritional assessment criteria with QoL in 50 patients with advanced colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second aim was to investigate changes in body weight and QoL during a 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle mass, nutritional risk, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> according to three different criteria were assessed, as well as health-related QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At inclusion, 36 patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, 10 patients sarcopenia, 25 were at nutritional risk, 16 were malnourished and 11, 14 and 31 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> according to different criteria </plain></SENT>
