<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for unresectable colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> can reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, which sometimes leads to curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to identify and describe patients with initially unresectable liver-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who obtained sufficient chemotherapeutic benefit that eventually lead to the removal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic diseases</z:e> in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A phase II multicenter cooperative study was conducted in 38 medical institutions using modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy from January 2008 to June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with liver-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> that was deemed not optimally resectable by liver surgeons received mFOLFOX6 as preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy for 6-8 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were reassessed for resectability after 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery was carried out 3-6 weeks after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the rate of macroscopic curative surgery including liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 36 patients (23 male/13 female, ECOG performance status 0-1) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 62.5 years; 78% (28 patients) had 5 or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e>, and 50% (18 patients) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> over 5 cm diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mFOLFOX6 regimen was safety administered resulting in 18 partial responses (50%), 12 stable disease, and 4 progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no grade 3/4 neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (38.9%) underwent surgery (R0: 13; R1: 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these, thirteen patients (36.1%) underwent R0 surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that mFOLFOX6 has a high response rate in patients with liver-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, allowing for R0 resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in a proportion of patients initially not judged to be optimally resectable </plain></SENT>
