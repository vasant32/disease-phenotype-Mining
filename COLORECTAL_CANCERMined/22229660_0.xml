<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed data from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> treated on a clinical trial of a regimen of HAI <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> combined with systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlations between patient characteristics, response, and toxicity and body composition data taken from CT images were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight of 57 patients (mean age 56 yr; 60% women) had available CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (22/48, 46%); 30/48 patients (63%) had body mass index (BMI) â‰¥25 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty (42%) of 48 patients were sarcopenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 adverse events did not differ among patients with and without sarcopenia or according to BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival (95% C]) was 167 (128-206) days for sarcopenic and 280 (214-346) days for nonsarcopenic patients (P = 0.271) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose, the median survival was 103 days for sarcopenic and 312 days for nonsarcopenic patients (P = 0.173) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sarcopenia was present in 30% (6/20) of patients with reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size posttreatment, and in 52% (14/27) of patients with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (P = 0.171) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, body composition was not significantly associated with toxicities or survival in our small sample </plain></SENT>
