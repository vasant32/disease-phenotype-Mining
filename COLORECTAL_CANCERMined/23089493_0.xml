<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate microsatellite pathologic score in serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with high microsatellite instability histologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 81 matched conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were tested with microsatellite pathologic score, and the results were compared with those of 24 high microsatellite instability histologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Validation was performed by microsatellite instability analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> with high microsatellite instability histologic features rendered a more than 5.5 score, the microsatellite pathologic score performance was of lower rank in high microsatellite instability serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> because none of the cases scored above 5.5 (&gt;77% probability of being high microsatellite instability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High microsatellite instability serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> shows pathologic features different from those observed in high microsatellite instability histologic features such as adverse prognostic histologic features at the invasive front </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We describe a serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> subtype showing high microsatellite instability and some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, high microsatellite instability histologic features that would not be detected if the microsatellite pathologic score cutoff is set at the highest rank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To increase microsatellite pathologic score sensitivity in serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, we propose to set up a 2.1 cutoff score when faced by a right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with serrated features </plain></SENT>
