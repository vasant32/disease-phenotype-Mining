<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A C/G polymorphism at 1,245 bp (C1245G) in exon 7 of the OGG1 (Ser326Cys, rs1052133) is found to have a lower enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A variety of case-control studies have been published evaluating the association between OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), though their conclusions were always contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This meta-analysis enrolled 12 studies to estimate the overall risk of OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pooled odds ratios (ORs) were performed for codominant model (Cys/Cys versus Ser/Ser; Ser/Cys versus Ser/Ser), dominant model (Ser/Cys + Cys/Cys versus Ser/Ser) and recessive model (Cys/Cys versus Ser/Cys + Ser/Ser) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant associations were found for Cys/Cys versus Ser/Ser (OR = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-1.53), Ser/Cys versus Ser/Ser (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.95-1.13), Ser/Cys + Cys/Cys versus Ser/Ser (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.98-1.16) and Cys/Cys versus Ser/Cys + Ser/Ser (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.90-1.38); moreover, in the stratified analyses, no significantly increased risk was found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that the OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism is not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
