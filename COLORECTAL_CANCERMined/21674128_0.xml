<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied patterns of DNA damage signaling and cell cycle response to clinically-relevant (bolus) and high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines with differing MMR and TP53 status in an attempt to better understand how 5-FU exerts its cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ATM/CHEK2/ CHEK1 signaling pathway was not activated in response to bolus 5-FU in the MMR-deficient cell lines HCT116 (TP53-proficient or TP53-depleted) and HCT15 (TP53-deficient), consistent with negligible/reparable DNA damage and no cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of DNA damage checkpoint activation in bolus 5-FU-treated HT29 (TP53-deficient/MMR-proficient) cultures suggested SSB formation (CHEK1 activation) followed by DSB formation (CHEK2 activation and increased phospho-H2AX levels), but no cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> suggested that DNA repair capacity was not overwhelmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-dose 5-FU treatment led to activation of ATM/CHEK2/TP53 (not CHEK1) in TP53-proficient and TP53-depleted HCT116 (later CHEK2 activation relative to TP53-proficient) cultures; HCT15 cultures had ATM activation only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data and increased phospho-H2AX levels indicated DSB formation; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was induced in both cell lines indicating irreparable DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TP53-depleted HCT116 cultures also had DSBs after high-dose 5-FU treatment but experienced a (transient) G1/S cell cycle arrest that protected them from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TP53 phosphorylation at Ser20/33/37 was seen in TP53-proficient HCT116 cultures regardless of 5-FU concentration at ≥4 h following treatment, indicating TP53 stabilization/transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, activation of ATM, CHEK1 and/or CHEK2 and phospho-H2AX levels reflected the nature of 5-FU-induced DNA damage and indi-cated when DNA damage was significant (5-FU-dose-dependent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA repair and cell cycle responses to 5-FU-induced DNA damage were distinctly affected by MMR and TP53 (role in BER/NER) functionalities, but MMR deficiency especially seemed to confer less overall sensitivity to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
