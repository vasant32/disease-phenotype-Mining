<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug also prevents the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the recurrence of high-grade colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism by which UDCA elicits its beneficial effects is not entirely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether ileal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> binding protein (IBABP) has a role in mediating the effects of UDCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that UDCA binds to a single site on IBABP and increases the affinity for major human <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> at a second binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As UDCA occupies one of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> binding sites on IBABP, it reduces the cooperative binding that is often observed for the major human <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IBABP is necessary for the full activation of farnesoid X receptor α (FXRα) by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, including UDCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that IBABP may have a role in mediating some of the intestinal effects of UDCA </plain></SENT>
