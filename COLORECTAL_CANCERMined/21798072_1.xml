<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using validated instruments administered via telephone and postal surveys, data will be collected on socio-demographic factors, work status and circumstances, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for both groups while the cases will have additional data collected on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment and symptoms, work productivity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes include change in work participation at 12 months, time to work re-entry, work limitations and change in HRQoL status </plain></SENT>
