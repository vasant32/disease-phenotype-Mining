<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between May 2002 and August 2009, 310 patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A CVC was inserted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients for administration of PN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 117 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and blood cultures for diagnosis of CVC-RBSI were obtained from them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A final total of 22 patients were diagnosed as having CVC-RBSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factors for CVC-RBSI using the clinical characteristics of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of univariate analyses revealed that only the Glasgow Prognostic Score was an independent risk factor for CVC-RBSI (odds ratio 3.733; 95% confidence interval 1.416-9.844; p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow Prognostic Score is associated with CVC-RBSI in patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery with administration of PN </plain></SENT>
