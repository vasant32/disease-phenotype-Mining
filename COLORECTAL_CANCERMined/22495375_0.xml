<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amount of DNA in routine paraffin sections is small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical specimens retained in formalin for the long-term (several months) left over from the sampling required for wax embedding can be referred to as "long-term formalin-fixed" specimens, and clearly this material is a rich source of DNA; however, it is difficult to extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we designed a microwave-heating method for DNA extraction from these specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the heating procedure achieved greater DNA yields than a common nonheating method used for comparison (DNA contents mean±SD, heating 2.16±0.95 μg/μL vs. common 1.75±0.90 μg/μL, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence multiplex polymerase chain reaction-capillary electrophoresis successfully detected microsatellite instability (MSI) in the DNA samples derived from this heating procedure (98.4%, 689 of 700 sample tests), at significantly higher levels than from the conventional method (82.3%, 247 of 300 sample tests, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified 10 (14.3%) MSI with high frequency and 6 (8.6%) MSI with low frequency <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSI with high frequency <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> showed distinct clinicopathologic features including higher incidence of right-sided location, high histologic grade, mucin-production, and prominent intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the microwave-heating method was efficient for DNA isolation from long-term formalin-fixed tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The successful fluorescence multiplex polymerase chain reaction-capillary electrophoresis analysis in these samples might facilitate MSI detection in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
