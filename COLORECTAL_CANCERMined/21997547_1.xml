<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cap-assisted colonoscopy (CAC) uses a small plastic transparent cap attached to the tip of the colonoscope that can depress and flatten colonic folds and thus improve visualisation of their proximal aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare CAC with standard colonoscopy (SC; high-definition white light) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a prospective randomised controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The study was performed in a tertiary-care Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Subjects undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomised to undergo either CAC or SC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were the proportion of subjects with at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> detected per subject, insertion time, caecal intubation rates and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 420 subjects were enrolled and included in the study (210 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of subjects with at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was higher with CAC compared to SC (69% vs 56%, p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CAC also detected a higher number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> per subject (2.3 vs 1.4, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The caecal intubation time was shorter with CAC (3.29 min vs 3.98 min, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The caecal intubation rates were similar in the two groups (99% vs 98%, p=0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no complications associated with CAC or SC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAC detected a 13% higher number of subjects with at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 59% higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> per subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CAC is a safe, effective and practical means to improve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 01211132 </plain></SENT>
