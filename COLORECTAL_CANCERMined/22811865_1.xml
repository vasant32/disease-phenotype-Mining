<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past two decades, hepatic metastasectomy has emerged as a promising technique for improving survival in patients with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and in some cases providing long-term cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To maximize safety and efficacy of metastasectomy, appropriate pre-operative imaging is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Advancements in computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) have led to improved detection of occult lesions and better definition of surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While CT, PET and MRI have a comparable sensitivity for detection of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, MRI excels at detection of subcentimeter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> compared to CT and FDG-PET, especially with the combination of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and hepatocyte-specific contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT may be useful as a screening modality or in preoperative planning such as volumetric estimation of the remnant liver size or in defining preoperative arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> for hepatic artery infusion pump placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While technologic advancements have led to unprecedented image quality and clarity, this does not replace the need for a dedicated, competent radiologist with experience in hepatic imaging </plain></SENT>
