<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Eligible patients aged 40 or more years, with IDA diagnosed in primary care, and a subsequent diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Referral pathways were identified using the specialty of first recorded GP referral following IDA diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in time to diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were assessed by referral specialty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in the proportion of cases referred before and after the re-issue of the NICE urgent referral guidelines for suspected lower gastrointestinal (GI) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 628,882 eligible patients, 3.1% (n = 19,349) were diagnosed with IDA during the study period; 3.0% (n = 578) were subsequently diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and fifty-nine (44.8%) patients had no recorded referral or a referral unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> or the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 35% (n = 201) of patients were referred to a relevant specialty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis ranged from 2.5 months (referral to a relevant surgical specialty) to 31.9 months (haematology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time to diagnosis was longer in patients referred to a medical compared with a relevant surgical specialty (P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis before and after the NICE guidelines were re-issued in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significant differences exist between referral specialties in time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis following a primary care diagnosis of IDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite NICE referral recommendations, a significant proportion of patients are still not managed within recommended care pathways to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
