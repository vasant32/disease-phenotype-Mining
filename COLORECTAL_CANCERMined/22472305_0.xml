<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fecal immunochemical tests for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> are replacing traditional guaiac fecal occult blood tests in population screening programs for many reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the many available fecal immunochemical test devices use a range of sampling methods, differ with regard to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> stability, and report <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations in different ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methods for sampling, the mass of feces collected, and the volume and characteristics of the buffer used in the sampling device also vary among fecal immunochemical tests, making comparisons of test performance characteristics difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fecal immunochemical test results may be expressed as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration in the sampling device buffer and, sometimes, albeit rarely, as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration per mass of feces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current lack of consistency in units for reporting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration is particularly problematic because apparently similar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations obtained with different devices can lead to very different clinical interpretations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent adoption of an internationally accepted method for reporting results would facilitate comparisons of outcomes from these tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose a simple strategy for reporting fecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration that will facilitate the comparison of results between fecal immunochemical test devices and across clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such reporting is readily achieved by defining the mass of feces sampled and the volume of sample buffer (with confidence intervals) and expressing results as micrograms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> per gram of feces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that manufacturers of fecal immunochemical tests provide this information and that the authors of research articles, guidelines, and policy articles, as well as pathology services and regulatory bodies, adopt this metric when reporting fecal immunochemical test results </plain></SENT>
