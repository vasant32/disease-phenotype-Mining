<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1999, aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were shown to form blood-conducting tubes not lined by endothelial cells, and this phenomenon was termed vasculogenic mimicry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and the presence of vasculogenic mimicry in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, patient survival, and genetic indicators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were examined from a study of 117 patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with a 12-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis was used to measure microvessel density and proliferating endothelial cells and to detect vasculogenic mimicry (scored by 3 independent observers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell cultures from 7 colon cell lines, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on cell lines, frozen tissue material from 4 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with and 4 without vasculogenic mimicry, and fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue from 2 patients were used to investigate the relationship between vasculogenic mimicry and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microvessel density was not a prognostic marker in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found vasculogenic mimicry in 23 (19.7%) of 117 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell culture experiments and real-time PCR on human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> material showed evidence for vasculogenic mimicry with overexpression of EPHA2 and LAMC2, known to be important for the tube-forming capacity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of vasculogenic mimicry was associated with significantly shortened survival, both overall (P &lt; 0.0001) and within intermediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stages (Dukes B, P = 0.0277; Dukes C, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vasculogenic mimicry can occur in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and appears to be comparable to vasculogenic mimicry described in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, vasculogenic mimicry in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> may be a strong independent prognostic marker for survival </plain></SENT>
