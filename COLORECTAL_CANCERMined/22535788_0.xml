<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> outcomes vary between and within countries with patients from deprived backgrounds known to have inferior survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors set out to explore the effect of deprivation in relation to the accessibility of hospitals offering diagnostic and therapeutic services on stage at presentation and receipt of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Analysis of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data included stage and treatment details from the first 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The socioeconomic status of the immediate area of residence and the travel time from home to hospital was derived from the postcode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Population-based study of patients resident in a large area in the north of England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 39â€ˆ619 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed between 1994 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES MEASURED: Stage of diagnosis and receipt of treatment in relation to deprivation and distance from hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the most deprived quartile were significantly more likely to be diagnosed at stage 4 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (OR 1.516, p&lt;0.05) but less so for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for both sites for patients in the most deprived quartile to be less likely to receive chemotherapy for stage 4 disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> were very significantly less likely to receive any treatment if they came from any but the most affluent area (ORs 0.639, 0.603 and 0.544 in increasingly deprived quartiles), this may have been exacerbated if the hospital was distant from their residence (OR for forth quartile for both travel and deprivation 0.731, not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect was less for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and no effect of distance was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Residing in a deprived area is associated with tendencies to higher stage at diagnosis and especially in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> to reduced receipt of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These observations are consistent with other findings and indicate that access to diagnosis requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
