<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alteration in the expression level or structure of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase (GST) enzymes may lead to inadequate detoxification of potential carcinogens and consequently contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A member of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase (GST) family, GSTP1, is an attractive candidate for involvement in susceptibility to carcinogen-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An A&gt;G transition in exon 5 resulting in an Ile105Val amino acid substitution has been identified which alters catalytic efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the possible impact of Ile105Val GSTP1 polymorphism on susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>. in Jordan We examined 90 tissue samples previously diagnosed with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and 56 non-cancerous colon tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from paraffin embedded tissues and the status of the GSTP1 polymorphism was determined using a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases and controls for the GSTP1 Ile/Ile, Ile/Val and Val/Val genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase polymorphism was not associated with risk in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases in Jordan stratified by age, sex, site, grade or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism is unlikely to affect the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
