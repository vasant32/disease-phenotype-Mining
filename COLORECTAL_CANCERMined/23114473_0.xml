<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many patients suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100245'>desmoid tumors</z:hpo>, which are challenging to treat due to invasive growth and local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of our study were to determine the effectiveness of screening in GS and analyze outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100245'>desmoid tumors</z:hpo> by treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cohort study of a family of 105 descendants with GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> family members who agreed were screened by endoscopy, and colorectal resection was performed upon pending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079218" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">desmoids</z:e> were excised, whereas large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were treated by a combination of brachytherapy (BT) and radiotherapy (RT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and overall and disease-specific mortality (ClinicalTrial.gov ID NCT01286662) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 105 family members have GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preventive colorectal resections were performed in 16 patients (15 %), with one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In four patients who denied screening endoscopy, invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors of the colon</z:e> (three patients) and stomach developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100245'>desmoid tumors</z:hpo>, 10 (30 %) were located in the mesentery, 17 (52 %) in the abdominal wall, and 6 (18 %) in extra-abdominal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Excision of 12 desmoids was performed in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079218" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">desmoids</z:e> were treated by BT and RT and showed full or partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Provided adequate screening, good long-term control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> is achievable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100245'>desmoid tumors</z:hpo> determine survival and quality of life in many patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest good local control using a combination of brachytherapy/radiotherapy in large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079218" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">desmoids</z:e> unsuitable for surgical resection </plain></SENT>
