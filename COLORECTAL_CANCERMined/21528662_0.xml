<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, studies have evaluated biological and clinical prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alkaline phosphatase seems to be a key prognostic factor, so we have reviewed the outcomes of our patients with respect to alkaline phosphatase levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Between January 2003 and December 2008, we treated with the FOLFOX 4 regimen 103 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients had alkaline phosphatase &gt; or =300 U/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median time to progression was 4 months for patients with high alkaline phosphatase levels and 8 months for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003282'>low alkaline phosphatase</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 8 and 17.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 3 patients in the high alkaline phosphatase group obtained partial response (9.4%) compared to 3 complete responses and 24 partial responses (41.5%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003282'>low alkaline phosphatase</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was substantially different, with more grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral mucositis</z:e> in the high than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003282'>low alkaline phosphatase</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alkaline phosphatase is an uncomplicated and potent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with high alkaline phosphatase levels had a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
