<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The NHS bowel screening programme offers people aged 60-69 screening by faecal occult blood (FOB) testing, with colonoscopy as the diagnostic test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the calculation of targets for the purpose of monitoring screening performance in the programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Targets were calculated for the prevalent round of screening in people aged 60-69, and for the 'steady state' of the programme when people will be offered their first screen at age 60 and subsequent screens at ages 62-69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Targets for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates per 1000 people screened and per 100 colonoscopies were calculated using information from the English <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> screening pilot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the prevalent round, prevalent screen and incident screens the calculated targets for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection rate are 2.3, 1.3 and 1.7 per 1000 people respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate the targets are 6.7, 5.2 and 5.5 per 1000 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Targets for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection rate per 100 colonoscopies are 11.3, 7.5 and 8.4 and those for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate are 32.0, 30.4 and 32.5 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of these targets is to ensure that the national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> screening programme is effective with a high quality of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates per 1000 people are those estimated to be necessary to achieve the expected mortality reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rates per 100 colonoscopies (equivalent to the positive predictive value of referral to colonoscopy) are designed to maintain a high quality of screening by minimizing the number of false-positive referrals </plain></SENT>
