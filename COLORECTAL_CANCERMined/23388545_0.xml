<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) are at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standard method of surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in UC by colonoscopy is invasive and can miss flat lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify a gene expression signature in nondysplastic mucosa without active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> that could serve as a marker for remote neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene expression was analyzed by complementary DNA microarray in 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, 4 UC patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 11 UC patients harboring remote <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Common gene ontology pathways of significantly differentially expressed genes were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of genes which were progressively and significantly upregulated from controls to UC without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, to UC with remote <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several gene products were also examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-eight genes were significantly upregulated, and 541 genes were significantly downregulated in UC patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> compared with UC patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine genes (ACSL1, BIRC3, CLC, CREM, ELTD1, FGG, S100A9, THBD, and TPD52L1) were progressively and significantly upregulated from controls to nondysplastic UC to UC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining of proteins revealed increased expression of S100A9 and REG1Î± in UC-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and in nondysplastic tissue from UC patients harboring remote <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> compared with UC patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression changes occurring as a field effect in the distal colon of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> UC identify patients harboring remote neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These markers may lead to a more accurate and less invasive method of detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
