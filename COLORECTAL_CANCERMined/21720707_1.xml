<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports show that CLDN1 overexpression is significantly related to the malignant behavior in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types whereas its significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study comprised 119 patients who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, as well as 3 cell lines derived from human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation of gene expression with clinical parameters in patients was assessed by knockdown experiments using 3 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with high CLDN1 expression were statistically shown to have a relatively better prognosis, and those with low CLDN1 expression showed poorer overall survival and disease-free survival than those with high expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assessment of CLDN1 knockdown in the 3 cell lines demonstrated that the siRNA inhibition resulted in a statistically significant increase in cell invasiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present data strongly suggest that CLDN1 expression is a prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
