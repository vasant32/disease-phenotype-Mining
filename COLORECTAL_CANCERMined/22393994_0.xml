<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Endostar plus leucovorin calcium/ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX4) in treating patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were retrospectively assigned to one of two treatment groups: FOLFOX4 (control) or FOLFOX4 plus Endostar (Endostar) according to patient accreditation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observational end points were overall response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate and progression-free survival of Endostar were significantly better than those of control group (P &lt;0.05), but significance was not observed for median survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, gastrointestinal side effects and incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e> were not lower than in the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of Endostar to FOLFOX4 resulted in a higher objective response rate and longer time to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> were the principal safety concerns, but were manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endostar deserves to be further investigated by randomized controlled clinical trails </plain></SENT>
