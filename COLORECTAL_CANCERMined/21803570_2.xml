<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is associated with an increased risk of development and recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (ACC) patients is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of body mass index (BMI) on overall survival (OS) in ACC patients receiving systemic treatment in two large phase III studies (CAIRO and CAIRO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment data were obtained and analysed from 796 ACC patients who were treated with chemotherapy in the CAIRO study, and from 730 ACC patients who were treated with chemotherapy plus targeted therapy in the CAIRO2 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline height and weight were used to assign patients to one of the following BMI categories: A (&lt;18.5 kg/m(2)), B (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), C (25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) and D (â‰¥30.0 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 796 patients of the CAIRO study a high BMI was associated with better median OS (8.0, 14.9, 18.4 and 19.5 months for BMI categories A, B, C, and D, respectively; P=0.001), and was an independent prognostic factor for OS in a multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI was not associated with OS in 730 patients who participated in the CAIRO2 study, although a trend was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that BMI is an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients receiving chemotherapy, but not in patients receiving chemotherapy and targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possible decreased efficacy of bevacizumab in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients may explain this discrepant result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of BMI in patients receiving targeted therapy should be further tested </plain></SENT>
