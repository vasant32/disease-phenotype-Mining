<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, BRAF mutations seem to be an important negative prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to establish the concordance of KRAS and BRAF mutational status in paired biopsy and resection specimens of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using several analytic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks of 126 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS codon 12/13 and BRAF V600E mutational status was assessed using high resolution melting (HRM), direct sequencing (DS) of the HRM polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Therascreen Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)-Scorpion KRAS assay and BRAF pyrosequencing were employed; both assays claim to require less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells in comparison with DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS and BRAF were found to be mutually exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation frequencies were 33.9% for KRAS, and for BRAF 19.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concordance of KRAS mutational status between biopsy and resection specimens was 97.4% (ARMS), 98.4% (DS) and 99.2% (HRM), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For BRAF concordance was 98.4% (Pyro, DS) and 99.2% (HRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KRAS and BRAF mutational status of endoscopic biopsies and resection specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> showed a &gt;95% concordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsies can be confidently used for molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
