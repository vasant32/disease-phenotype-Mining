<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a new <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CaIX-P1) with affinity for human carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) was identified and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to characterize the properties of CaIX-P1 for targeting human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and investigate the correlation of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> binding with the expression of carbonic anhydrase IX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> HCT116 and HT29 cells were investigated for CAIX expression using Western Blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding and competition studies of 125I-radiolabeled CaIX-P1 were performed on HCT116 cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FACS analysis and fluorescence microscopy studies were carried out after cell incubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-labeled CaIX-P1 and rhodamine-labeled anti-human CAIX-mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our studies revealed an enhanced in vitro expression of carbonic anhydrase IX in HCT116 and HT29 cells with increasing cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Binding of 125I-labeled-CaIX-P1 on HCT116 cells increased with increasing cell density and correlated to the CAIX expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FACS analysis demonstrated a correlation of cell labeling between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-CaIX-P1 and rhodamine-labeled anti-CAIX-mAb in both HCT116 and HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of our study indicate that the phage display identified <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> CaIX-P1 might be an attractive candidate for the development of a ligand targeting CAIX in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
