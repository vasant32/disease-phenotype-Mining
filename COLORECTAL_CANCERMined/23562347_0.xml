<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the proportion of interval left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) after flexible sigmoidoscopy vs colonoscopy in older patients and to identify factors associated with interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare-linked database, we studied patients 67 years or older with left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who had at least one lower endoscopy performed within the previous 36 months between July 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> diagnosed within 6 months of lower endoscopy were defined as detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> diagnosed 6 to 36 months after lower endoscopy were defined as interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> was calculated as number of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> divided by number of detected and interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ï‡(2) test and a multivariate logistic regression model were used in the statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 15,484 older patients with left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the proportion of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> after flexible sigmoidoscopy was 8.8% compared with 2.5% after colonoscopy (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference was similar across left colon locations and largest in the descending colon (17.1% vs 3.5%; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression, the odds of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> after flexible sigmoidoscopy was 3 times as high as that after colonoscopy (odds ratio, 3.52; 95% CI, 2.66-4.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In older patients with left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the odds of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> after flexible sigmoidoscopy was 3 times as high as that after colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether this finding reflects differences in bowel preparation quality, sedation use, or depth of insertion warrants future research </plain></SENT>
