<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to human vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and has been used for many types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab might be effective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, because VEGF has been reported to be involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> as well as other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there are no established biomarkers to predict the bevacizumab efficacy in spite of clinical needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we tried to identify the predictive markers for efficacy of bevacizumab in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> patients by using bevacizumab-sensitive and insensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine human gastric and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mouse xenografts were examined for their sensitivity to bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined expression levels of angiogenic factors by ELISA, bioactivity of VEGF by phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in HUVEC after addition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> homogenate, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microvessel density by CD31-immunostaining, and polymorphisms of the VEGF gene by HybriProbeâ„¢ assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 9 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> used, GXF97, MKN-45, MKN-28, 4-1ST, SC-08-JCK, and SC-09-JCK were bevacizumab-sensitive, whereas SCH, SC-10-JCK, and NCI-N87 were insensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> model to bevacizumab was not related to histological type or HER2 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with high levels of VEGF were bevacizumab-sensitive except for one, SC-10-JCK, which had high levels of VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reason for the refractoriness was non-bioactivity on the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and micro-vessel formation of VEGF, but was not explained by the VEGF allele or VEGF165b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also examined the expression levels of other angiogenic factors in the 11 gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the refractory models including SC-10-JCK, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> levels of another angiogenic factor, bFGF, were relatively high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The VEGF/bFGF ratio correlated more closely with sensitivity to bevacizumab than with the VEGF level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VEGF levels and VEGF/bFGF ratios in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were related to bevacizumab sensitivity of the xenografts tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further clinical investigation into useful predictive markers for bevacizumab sensitivity is warranted </plain></SENT>
