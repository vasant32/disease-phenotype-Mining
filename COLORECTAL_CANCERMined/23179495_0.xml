<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine reporting of treatment summaries and follow-up instructions among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, we created logistic regression models among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors not in treatment (n = 1,345) to determine characteristics associated with reporting treatment summaries and written follow-up instructions, adjusting for sociodemographic, access, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings are presented for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors and those recently diagnosed (≤4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined unadjusted associations between written instructions and subsequent surveillance and screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among those recently diagnosed, 38 % reported receiving treatment summaries and 58 % reported written instructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors, approximately one third reported summaries and 44 % reported written instructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, lower reporting of summaries was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site, race, and number of treatment modalities among those recently diagnosed, and white vs. black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, breast vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, &gt;10 vs. ≤5 years since diagnosis, no clinical trials participation, and better than fair health among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For instructions, lower reporting was associated with no trials participation and lower income among those recently diagnosed, and increasing age, white vs. black race, lower income, &gt;10 vs. ≤5 years since diagnosis, 1 vs. ≥2 treatment modalities, no trials participation, and at least good vs. fair/poor health among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Written instructions were associated with reporting provider recommendations for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> surveillance, and recent screening mammograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Many recently diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors did not report receiving treatment summaries and written follow-up instructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Opportunities exist to examine associations between use of these documents and recommended care and outcomes, and to facilitate their adoption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CANCER</z:e> SURVIVORS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> survivors who have completed therapy should ask their providers for treatment summaries and written follow-up instructions, and discuss with them how their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and therapy impact their future health care </plain></SENT>
