<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We proposed a hydrogel bead-array to digitally count <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mutants in stool at a low cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At first, multiplex amplification of targets containing multiple mutation loci of interest is carried out by a target enriched multiplex PCR (Tem-PCR), yielding the templates qualified for emulsion PCR (emPCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, after immobilizing the beads from emPCR on a glass surface, the incorporation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37990">Cy3</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> into the mutant-specific probes, which are specifically hybridized with the amplified beads from emPCR, is used to color the beads coated with mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> amplified beads are hybridized with the Cy5-labeled universal probe, a mutation rate is readily obtained by digitally counting the beads with different colors (yellow and red) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high specificity of the method is achieved by removing the mismatched probes in a bead-array with electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The approach has been used to simultaneously detect 8 mutation loci within the APC, TP53, and KRAS genes in stools from eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were positively diagnosed; therefore, our method can be a potential tool for the noninvasive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
