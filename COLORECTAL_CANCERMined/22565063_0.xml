<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resulting plasma concentrations of tegafur are much higher than those of 5-FU; thus, analytical methods are needed that are sensitive enough to detect low plasma concentrations of 5-FU and robust enough to simultaneously analyze tegafur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous LC-MS/MS methods have either failed to demonstrate the ability to simultaneously measure low 5-FU and high tegafur plasma levels, or failed to be applicable in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to develop a method capable of measuring low concentrations of 5-FU (8-200 ng/ml) and high concentrations of tegafur (800-20,000 ng/ml) in human plasma and to subsequently evaluate the utility of the method in patient samples collected during a phase I clinical study where oral doses of either 200mg or 300 mg UFÂ®/LV (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> and tegafur in a 4:1 molar ratio plus leucovorin) were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A combined LC-MS/MS and LC-UV method was developed utilizing negative ion atmospheric pressure ionization (API) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method provides an accuracy and precision of &lt;10% and &lt;6%, respectively, for both analytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Material recoveries from the liquid-liquid extraction technique were 97-110% and 86-91% for tegafur and 5-FU, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Utilization of this method to determine tegafur and 5-FU plasma concentrations followed by noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses successfully estimated pharmacokinetic parameters (C(MAX), t(MAX) and AUC(0-10h)) in the clinical study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, this method is ideal for the simultaneous bioanalysis of low levels of 5-FU and relatively higher levels of its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi>, tegafur, in human plasma for clinical pharmacokinetic analysis </plain></SENT>
