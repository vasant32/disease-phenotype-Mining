<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Literature search was performed to identify comparative studies reporting outcomes for both AR and NAR for CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pooled odds ratios (OR) and weighted mean differences (WMD with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using either the fixed effects model or random effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven nonrandomized controlled studies matched the selection criteria and reported on 1,662 subjects, of whom 989 underwent AR, and 673 underwent NAR for CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the perioperative results, NAR reduced the operation time (WMD, 0.39; 95% CI, 1.97-79.17) and blood transfusion requirement (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.87-4.74), whereas postoperative morbidity and mortality were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With respect to oncologic outcomes, there was no significant difference in surgical margins, overall survival and disease-free survival between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NAR is a safe procedure for CLM and does not compromise oncological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the findings have to be carefully interpreted due to the lower level of evidence </plain></SENT>
