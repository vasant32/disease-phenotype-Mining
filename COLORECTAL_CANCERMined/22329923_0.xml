<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2008-2009 our unit had a raw 30-day postoperative mortality close to the national average, but when it was nationally adjusted it appeared to be an outlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify reasons for this disparity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> records were obtained for patients undergoing surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> over the 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data submitted to NBOCAP to determine adjusted rates were compared with actual data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were major discordances between submitted and actual data for American Society of Anesthesiology grades and timing of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This explained why the unit appeared to be an outlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is increasing emphasis on outcome of health service delivery, which has important implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Submission of correct data is essential if objective comparison is to be made on which to base decisions on service delivery among units and within health regions </plain></SENT>
