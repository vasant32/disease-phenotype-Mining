<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, including p16INK4A in turn regulate CDK4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, deregulation of the p16/CDK4/cyclin D1 complex has been established in a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, changes in CDK4 have rarely been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In this study we used a combination of PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing for mutational screening of CDK4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocyte of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of head and neck, for screening germline mutations in coding regions of CDK4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variations observed in exon 2 and 5 were three missense mutations, g5051G &gt; C (Ser52Thr), g5095G &gt; C (Glu67Gln), g5906C &gt; A, g5907C &gt; G (Pro194Ser) and novel frame shift mutations g7321_23delTGA, g7121_7122insG, g7143delG in exon 7 and 3'UTR respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, two novel mutations were found in N terminal domain which indicates that CDK4 mutation may play a major role in the development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of head and neck </plain></SENT>
