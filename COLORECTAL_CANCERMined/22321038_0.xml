<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether quantification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> improved the predictive value of preoperative volumetric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing planned right or extended right hemi-hepatectomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were recruited prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> and future remnant liver volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were correlated with data on postoperative hepatic insufficiency, complications and hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations of remnant percentage, remnant mass to patient mass and remnant mass to body surface area with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> measurements were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 10 of the 30 patients the planned liver resection was altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate-severe postoperative hepatic dysfunction was seen in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications arose in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> was 3.8% (range: 1.2-17.6%), but was higher in patients (n= 10) who received preoperative chemotherapy (P= 0.124), in whom the median level was 4.8% (range: 1.5-17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The strongest correlation was that of remnant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240225" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver mass</z:e> to patient mass (r= 0.77, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the addition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> quantification did not improve this correlation (r= 0.76, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to combine volumetric with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> quantifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant benefit was seen in this small pilot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, these techniques may be useful in operative planning, particularly in patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
