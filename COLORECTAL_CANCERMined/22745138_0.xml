<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: consecutive patients (N=328) who were referred for elective colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One walnut-sized stool sample was collected from each patient for analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> M2PK content using an ELISA kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No dietary restrictions were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical pathologists who conducted the M2PK analyses were blinded to the patients' confirmed diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of fecal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> M2PK were compared with histopathological results from colorectal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: of the 328 patients who underwent colonoscopy examinations, 197 (60.1%) were men and 131 (39.9%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on histopathological examination, 83 (25.3%) patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bowel histology, 42 (12.8%) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 67 (20.4%) patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, 19 (5.8%) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, three (0.9%) patients had amoebic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and 114 (34.8%) patients had infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cutoff level for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> M2PK concentration was defined as 4.00 U/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the M2PK test were 71.4%, 71.0%, 73.5%, and 94.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and fecal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> M2PK level (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The M2PK test detected 16 tumors among 67 (23.9%) cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> among 19 (42.1%) cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, 35 tumors among 114 (30.7%) cases of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> among three (66.7%) cases of amoebic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the fecal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> M2PK test has good sensitivity and specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection, especially in high-risk or symptomatic populations </plain></SENT>
