<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analytical decision-simulated model for sample size and effectiveness projections based on primary and surrogate end points are necessary before planning a population-based RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Based on the study design similar to two previous RCTs, transition rates were estimated using a five-state natural history model [<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, preclinical detection phase (PCDP) Dukes' A/B, PCDP Dukes' C/D, Clinical Dukes' A/B and Clinical Dukes' C/D] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Markov cycle tree was assigned transition parameters, variables related to screening and survival rate that simulated results of 10-year follow-up in the absence of screening for a hypothetical cohort aged 45-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding screened arm was to simulate the results after the introduction of population-based screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with fecal occult blood test with stop screen design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The natural course of mean sojourn time for five-state Markov model were estimated as 2.75 years for preclinical Dukes' A/B and 1.38 years for preclinical Dukes' C/D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expected reductions in mortality and Dukes' C/D were 13% (95% confidence intervals: 7-19%) and 26% (95% confidence intervals: 20-32%), respectively, given a 70% acceptance rate and a 90% colonoscopy referral rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sample sizes required were 86,150 and 65,592 subjects for the primary end point and the surrogate end point, respectively, given an incidence rate up to 0.0020 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The sample sizes required for primary and surrogate end points and the projection of effectiveness of fecal occult blood test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening were developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both are very important to plan a population-based RCT </plain></SENT>
