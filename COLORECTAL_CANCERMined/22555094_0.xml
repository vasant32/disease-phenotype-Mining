<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Due to the approval of various new targeted therapies for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, molecular pathology laboratories with a diagnostic focus have to meet new challenges: simultaneous handling of a large number of samples, small amounts of input material, and fragmentation of nucleic acids because of formalin fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, fully automated systems for a fast and standardized extraction of high-quality DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the performance of a fully automated, high-throughput method for the extraction of nucleic acids from FFPE tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the extraction performance in sections of 5 different tissue types often analyzed in routine pathology laboratories (cervix, colon, liver, lymph node, and lung; n=340) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we compared the quality, labor input, and applicability of the method for diagnostic purposes with those of a laboratory-validated manual method in a clinical setting by screening a set of 45 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> for the KRAS mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Automated extraction of both DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was successful in 339 of 340 FFPE samples representing 5 different tissue types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison with a conventional manual extraction protocol, the method showed an overall agreement of 97.7% (95% confidence interval, 88.2%-99.9%) for the subsequent mutational analysis of the KRAS gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fully automated system is a promising tool for a simple, robust, and rapid extraction of DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from formalin-fixed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It ensures a standardization of sample processing and can be applied to clinical FFPE samples in routine pathology </plain></SENT>
