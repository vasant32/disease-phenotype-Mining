<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent population-based studies in Alberta, Canada, found that approximately 50% of patients with stage III colon or stages II/III <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> did not receive guideline-recommended treatment (surgery plus chemotherapy or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e>); a primary reason was not having an oncologist consult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the relationship between the hospital where the surgery was performed and the probability of a patient not having an oncologist consult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with stage III colon or stage II/III <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> between 2002 and 2005 in Alberta who had surgery were identified from the Alberta <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression modeling with hospitals as random effects was used to estimate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-type-specific odds ratios of not having an oncologist consult for each hospital, adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities, relative to the overall nonconsultation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 21% of stage III colon, 25% of stage II rectal, and 13% of stage III <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients did not have an oncologist consult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates varied appreciably across hospitals and between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types within hospitals, even after the case-mix adjustment (adjusted odds ratios of nonconsultation ranged from 0.4 to 8.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small hospitals that performed 12 or fewer surgeries had nearly 100% consultation rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The variation in oncologist-consult rates, particularly for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage II rectal cancer</z:e> patients, is concerning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We are presenting the findings to the surgical community and discussing interventions to improve oncologist-consult rates </plain></SENT>
