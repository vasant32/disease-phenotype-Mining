<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed clinical data of 96 patients with DPGCC, comprising 63 men and 33 women, from among 4523 patients with gastric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent surgical treatment or chemotherapy, but no endoscopic resection, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1990 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The selected patients were classified into 2 groups according to the time of gastric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detection as follows: synchronous group (n= 42) and metachronous group (n = 54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 4523 patients treated for gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, DPGCC was diagnosed in 96 (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In terms of clinicopathologic features, the proportion of early-stage gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was higher in the metachronous DPGCC group, with P values of 0.02 and 0.01, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival in the metachronous DPGCC group was significantly longer than in the synchronous DPGCC group (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Metachronous DPGCC was identified as an independent predictor of survival by both univariate and multivariate analyses, with a P value of 0.02 and 0.006, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Metachronous DPGCC had a better prognosis than synchronous DPGCC due to the tendency for metachronous DPGCC to occur in patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
