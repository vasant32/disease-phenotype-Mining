<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We postulated that the risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> (VTE) may persist after discharge and tested this hypothesis in patients undergoing colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database was queried for patients undergoing colorectal resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> from 2005 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome analyzed was a 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable forward stepwise regression was used to identify independent predictors of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The database contained 21 943 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 30-day DVT rate was 1.4% (306 of 21 943), 29% (89 of 306) were diagnosed post-discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 30-day PE rate was 0.8% (180 of 21 943), 33% (60 of 180) was diagnosed post-discharge, the combined DVT/PE rate was 2.0% (446 of 21 943) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time to diagnosis of VTE was 9 days (interquartile range 4-16) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-discharge VTE rates in patients with length of stay (LOS) less than 1 week (0.6%) were similar to patients with LOS greater than 1 week (0.7%, Fisher exact P not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for post-discharge VTE were preoperative steroid use for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition (odds ratio [OR] 2.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-5.57, P = .001) and preoperative systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> syndrome (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.24-4.10, P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of almost one third of postoperative VTE in this patient population occurred after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The duration of the prothrombotic stimulus of surgery is not well defined, and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> are at high risk of VTE; thromboprophylaxis after discharge should be considered for these patients </plain></SENT>
