<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Comparative evaluation of surgical quality among hospitals must improve outcome and efficiency, and reduce medical costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reoperation after colorectal surgery is a consequence of surgical complications and therefore considered a quality-of-care indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With respect to the mortality rate, the 1-year mortality may be a more meaningful figure than in-hospital mortality, because it also reflects the impact of surgical complications beyond discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the 1-year mortality after colorectal surgery and to identify predicting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study was a retrospective analysis from our colorectal surgery database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery from 2005 to 2008 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Both univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify predicting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following variables were analyzed: age, operative risk according to the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class, Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index, indication for and type of resection, primary anastomosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging, anastomotic leakage, and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For 743 consecutive patients, the 1-year mortality rate was 6.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were operated on mainly because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (n = 537; 72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of reoperation and in-hospital mortality was 12.8% and 2.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Univariate survival analysis demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class, age, Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index, reoperation, and stage of disease were independent predictors of 1-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class (P = .020; HR 1.69), age (P = .015; HR 2.08) and reoperation (P = .001; HR 2.72) are directly correlated with 1-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Both patients with benign diseases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no clear guidelines on whether to perform a reoperation were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: One-year mortality after colorectal surgery is independently predicted by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class, age, and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results underline the value of the 1-year mortality rate and the reoperation rate as parameters for quality assessment in colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
