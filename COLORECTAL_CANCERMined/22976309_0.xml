<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> involving hepatic veins (HV) at hepato-caval confluence (HC), major hepatectomy or vascular reconstruction, are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of communicating veins (CV) between adjacent HVs allows conservative hepatectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 61 year-old man was operated for multiple colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2 main CLM (14 and 3.5 cm in size) were adjacent, separated by the middle HV (MHV) at HC, and involved segments 1(paracaval portion), 7, and 8, and segments 4-superior(S4sup) and 1(paracaval portion), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At HC the larger CLM invaded the right HV (RHV), and the smaller was in contact with the left HV (LHV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A thick inferior RHV (IRHV), and 2 CVs connecting IRHV-MHV and MHV-LHV, were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After J-shaped thoracophrenolaparotomy, intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) confirmed the CVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liver was detached from the inferior vena cava preserving the IRHV: RHV was divided, and common trunk of MHV-LHV was taped, and, once clamped, hepato-petal flow in S4inf, S5, and S6 portal branches was confirmed at IOUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upper-transverse IOUS-guided resection, comprehensive of S7, S8, S4sup, and S1 (paracaval portion) with preservation of the CVs was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MHV at HC was divided once detachment of the LHV from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was ultimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No congestive areas remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No postoperative mortality and major morbidity occurred: patient was discharge on 17th postoperative day, and is disease-free at 7 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Detection of CVs between adjacent HVs enables new conservative hepatectomies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> at HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The herein described upper transversal hepatectomy despite two HVs are resected, allows adequate liver outflow and remaining functional liver parenchyma </plain></SENT>
