<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> detected by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and colon location among 20,792 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members ≥50 years of age who received a screening colonoscopy examination (102 gastroenterologists, 2006-2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> increased more rapidly with age in the proximal colon (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.05-2.80; 70-74 vs 50-54 years) than in the distal colon (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.63-2.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was higher among men vs women at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.66-1.89), increasing in men from 25% to 39% at ≥70 years and in women from 15% at 50-54 years to 26% (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> prevalence was higher among blacks than whites (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54), although total prevalence was similar, including persons &lt;60 years old (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.91-1.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> increases substantially with age and is much higher in men; proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> are more common among blacks than whites, although the total prevalence and the prevalence for ages &lt;60 years were similar by race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These demographic differences are such that current <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection guidelines may not be valid, without adjustment, for comparing providers serving different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The variation in prevalence and location may also have implications for the effectiveness of screening methods in different demographic groups </plain></SENT>
