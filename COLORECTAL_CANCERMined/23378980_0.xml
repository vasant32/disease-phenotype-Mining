<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current quality improvement tools for endoscopy services, such as the Global Rating Scale (GRS), emphasize the need for patient-centred care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no studies that have investigated patient expectations and⁄or perceptions of quality indicators in endoscopy services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify quality indicators for colonoscopy services from the patient perspective; to rate indicators of importance; to determine factors that influence indicator ratings; and to compare the identified indicators with those of the GRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A two-phase mixed methods study was undertaken in Montreal (Quebec), Calgary (Alberta) and Hamilton (Ontario) among patients ≥18 years of age who spoke and read English or French </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In phase 1, focus group participants identified quality indicators that were then used to construct a survey questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In phase 2, survey questionnaires, which were completed immediately after colonoscopy, prompted respondents to rate the 20 focus group-derived indicators according to their level of importance (low, medium, high) and to list up to nine additional items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors that influenced focus group-derived indicator ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient-identified indicators were compared with those used in the GRS to identify novel indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three quality indicator themes were identified by 66 participants in 12 focus groups: communication, comfort and service environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 828 surveys distributed, 402 (48.6%) were returned and 65% of focus group-derived indicators were rated highly important by at least 55% of survey respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indicator ratings differed according to age, sex, site and perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 29 patient-identified indicators, 17 (58.6%) were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients identified 17 novel quality indicators, suggesting that patients and health professionals differ in their perspectives with respect to quality in colonoscopy services </plain></SENT>
