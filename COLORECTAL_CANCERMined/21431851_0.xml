<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether or not to perform adjuvant chemotherapy on patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage II colorectal cancer</z:e> is a controversial issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to identify relevant risk factors for the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage II colorectal cancer</z:e> and to evaluate the need for adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between January 2000 and January 2005, 443 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage II colorectal cancer</z:e> who had received radical surgery at the Sun Yat-sen University <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rates and survival curves were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate prognostic analyses were performed using the Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with certain important risk factors were analyzed according to whether they received adjuvant chemotherapy, and four chemotherapeutic regimens were classified into sub-groups and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, an inadequate surgical margin, and sampling of less than 12 lymph nodes were risk factors that correlated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and insufficient lymph node samples achieved higher 5-year survival rates with adjuvant chemotherapy than with surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>Intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, sampling of less than 12 lymph nodes, and inadequate surgical margins were identified as risk factors for poor survival, and patients with either of the first two factors benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> alone may be insufficient for patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
