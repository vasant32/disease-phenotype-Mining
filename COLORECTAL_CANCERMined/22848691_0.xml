<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Over the past decades, many studies have used data mining technology to predict the 5-year survival rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but there have been few reports that compared multiple data mining algorithms to the TNM classification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> (TNM) staging system using a dataset in which the training and testing data were from different sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we compared nine data mining algorithms to the TNM staging system for colorectal survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two different datasets were used: 1) the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset; and 2) the dataset from a single Chinese institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An optimization and prediction system based on nine data mining algorithms as well as two variable selection methods was implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TNM staging system was based on the 7(th) edition of the American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> TNM staging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When the training and testing data were from the same sources, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> algorithms had slight advantages over the TNM staging system in predictive accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the data were from different sources, only four algorithms (logistic regression, general regression neural network, bayesian networks, and Na√Øve Bayes) had slight advantages over the TNM staging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, there was no significant differences among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the algorithms (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The TNM staging system is simple and practical at present, and data mining methods are not accurate enough to replace the TNM staging system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survival prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the predictive accuracy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the algorithms when the data were from different sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Building a larger dataset that includes more variables may be important for furthering predictive accuracy </plain></SENT>
