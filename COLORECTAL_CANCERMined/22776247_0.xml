<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear if patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> are at increased risk of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to estimate the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among patients with <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> and to compare the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between K. pneumoniae <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> and non-K. pneumoniae <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 at a medical centre in northern Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> status and survival status were determined until December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence data from the general population were retrieved from the Taiwan <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were defined as standardized incidence ratio and the incidence rate per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study included 2294 patients, of whom 1194 (52%) had K. pneumoniae <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 54 (2.3%) patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, corresponding to an overall incidence rate of 669.1 (95% CI, 490.7-847.6) per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The adjusted hazard ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 2.68 times greater for patients with K. pneumoniae <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> than for those with non-K. pneumoniae <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> (95% CI, 1.40-5.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with K. pneumoniae <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> had a significantly higher rate of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than did patients with non-K. pneumoniae <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy is recommended to detect occult colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in patients with <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>, particularly for patients over 60 years of age and with K. pneumoniae </plain></SENT>
