<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e>) is a common toxicity of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibody treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may be a marker of VEGF signalling pathway inhibition and therefore represent a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients treated with chemotherapy and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 101 consecutive patients with mCRC were treated with standard chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab at dose of 2.5 mg kg(-1) per week in a single centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time of the patients alive was 64 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was measured before each bevacizumab infusion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> was graded according to common toxicity criteria for adverse events version 3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 57 patients (56%) developed ≥grade 1 HTN (median blood pressure 168/97 mm Hg), whereas 44 (44%) remained normotensive when treated with bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate was higher among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> (30 vs 20%; P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was associated with improved progression-free survival (10.5 vs 5.3 months; P=0.008) and overall survival (25.8 vs 11.7 months; P&lt;0.001), and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> within 3 months had an independent, prognostic influence in a multivariate landmark survival analysis together with other known mCRC prognostic factors (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> and development of thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> may predict outcome of bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data require confirmation in prospective studies including pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic analyses </plain></SENT>
