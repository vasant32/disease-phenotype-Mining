<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previously reported phase II trial, the addition of COX-2 inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> to irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> did not appear to significantly increase the activity of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the COX-2 expression in the available <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from enrolled patients by immunohistochemistry, as well as its correlation with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with mCRC were enrolled in the phase II study between June 2002 and November 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received a combination of irinotecan 70 mg/m(2) over 30 min i.v. on days 1 and 8, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1,000 mg/m(2) twice per day orally on days 1-14 and the COX-2 inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> at a daily dose of 800 mg continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cycles were repeated every 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue samples were available for 17 patients enrolled on this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and was correlated with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the phase II study, the objective response rate was 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median time to progression was 7.7 months and median survival time was 21.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> COX-2 expression, by immunohistochemistry, was assessed for 17 patients enrolled in the same phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While not statistically significant, the response rate was better for patients in the low COX-2 expression group, while time to progression and overall survival was longer in patients in the high COX-2 expression group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy can be partially attributed to the small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the previously published phase II study, the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> to irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> did not appear to significantly increase the activity of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression by immunohistochemistry was neither prognostic nor predictive for response </plain></SENT>
