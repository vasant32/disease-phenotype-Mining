<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PubMed, Embase, and CBM databases were searched for eligible publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated using random or fixed effect models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, 24 case-control studies with a total of 7,230 CRC cases and 9,285 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses of a total of 24 studies showed there was a statistically significant association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in East Asians under four genetic models (T versus C, OR = 0.92, 95 % CI 0.85-0.99; TT versus CC, OR = 0.80, 95 % CI 0.69-0.94; TT versus CT/CC, OR = 0.82, 95 % CI 0.71-0.95; TT/CT versus CC, OR = 0.92, 95 % CI 0.86-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative meta-analyses for the allele contrast (T versus C), homozygote (TT versus CC), dominant (TT/CT versus CC), and recessive (TT versus CT/CC) models <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed a trend of more obvious association as information accumulated by year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses by country further identified this association in Korea and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis suggests that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in East Asians, and MTHFR 677T variant has a protective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
