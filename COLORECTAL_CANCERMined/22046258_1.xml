<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the US, African Americans (AAs) have the highest <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality and the lowest levels of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR) gene have been previously associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but few studies have included AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 795 AA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and 985 AA controls from Chicago and North Carolina as well as 1324 Caucasian cases and 990 Caucasian controls from Chicago and Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 54 tagSNPs in VDR (46586959 to 46521297 Mb) and tested for association adjusting for West African ancestry, age, gender, and multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Untyped markers were imputed using MACH1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed associations by gender and anatomic location in the whole study group as well as by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake in the North Carolina AA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the joint analysis, none of the SNPs tested was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For four previously tested restriction fragment length polymorphisms, only one (referred to as ApaI), tagged by the SNP rs79628898, had a nominally significant p-value in AAs; none of these polymorphisms were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the North Carolina AAs, for whom we had <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake data, we found a significant association between an intronic SNP rs11574041 and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake, which is evidence for a VDR gene-environment interaction in AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, using a systematic tagSNP approach, we have not found evidence for significant associations between VDR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in AAs or Caucasians </plain></SENT>
