<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abnormal microRNA (miRNA) expression has been linked to the development and progression of several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and such dysregulation can result from aberrant DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While a small number of miRNAs is known to be regulated by DNA methylation, we postulated that such epigenetic regulation is more prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By combining MBD-isolated Genome Sequencing (MiGS) to evaluate genome-wide DNA methylation patterns and microarray analysis to determine miRNA expression levels, we systematically searched for candidate miRNAs regulated by DNA methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found 64 miRNAs to be robustly methylated in HCT116 cells; eighteen of them were located in imprinting regions or already reported to be regulated by DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the remaining 46 miRNAs, expression levels of 18 were consistent with their DNA methylation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, 8 miRNAs were up-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> treatment and identified to be novel miRNAs regulated by DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrated the functional relevance of these epigenetically silenced miRNAs by ectopically expressing select candidates, which resulted in inhibition of growth and migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to reporting these findings, our study also provides a reliable, systematic strategy to identify DNA methylation-regulated miRNAs by combining DNA methylation profiles and expression data </plain></SENT>
