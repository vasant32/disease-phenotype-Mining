<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: De novo posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (PTM) is a serious complication of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incidences may vary among solid organ transplantations (SOTs) and may take to particular screening recommendations and posttransplantation care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult recipients, from the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Organ Procurement Transplant Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database (data as of September 3, 2010), of a primary kidney transplantation (KT), liver transplantation (LT), heart transplantation (HT) or lung transplantation (LuT) performed in the United States between 1999 and 2008 were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple-organ recipients and those whose grafts failed within 2 weeks after transplantation were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of PTM (in 1000 person-years) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and compared with SOT and the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort included 193,905 recipients (123,380 KT; 43,106 LT; 16511 HT; and 10,908 LuT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PTM incidence was 8.03, 11.0, 14.3, and 19.8 in KT, LT, HT, and LuT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In general, PTM recipients were 3 to 5 years older, mostly whites, and are males in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SOTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In KT, the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with the highest incidence was posttransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (PTLD, 1.58%), followed by lung (1.12%), prostate (0.82%), and kidney (0.79%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; in LT, PTLD (2.44%), lung and bronchial (2.18%), primary hepatic (0.91%), and prostate (0.88%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; in HT, lung and bronchial (3.24%) and prostate (3.07%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and PTLD (2.24%); and in LuT, lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007121" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bronchial cancers</z:e> (5.94%), PTLD (5.72%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (1.38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PTLD, Kaposi <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, and lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007121" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bronchial cancers</z:e> were increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SOTs, when compared with an older (55- to 59-year-old) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> incidence is different among solid organ transplantations, and ratios may be higher than those in the 55- to 59-year-old population </plain></SENT>
