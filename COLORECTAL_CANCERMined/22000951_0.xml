<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In man, germline defects in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes most commonly cause hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, while MMR defects have also been implicated in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoid tumours</z:e> in mice and in people </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMR expression in 10 small intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from younger cats (group 1, mean age 4.5 years) was compared with MMR expression in 30 small intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from older cats (group 2, mean age 12.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cross-reactivity of the antibodies specific for the human MMR proteins MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 with the corresponding proteins in feline tissues was first confirmed by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMR expression was then investigated immunohistochemically in feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 were detected immunohistochemically within neoplastic lymphocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the two groups in either the intensity of immunolabelling or the percentage of neoplastic cells within which MMR proteins were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the cross-reactivity of the human MMR antibodies with the corresponding proteins in feline tissues, but do not support the hypothesis that inherited germline MMR defects are a significant cause of feline small intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
