<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A growing body of work examines geographical setting as a source of health disparity, hypothesizing individual as well as larger, environmental sources of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, mechanisms by which this influence operates, especially in rural settings, are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the problem of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a rural US community through the lens of geographical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statewide maps of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> burdens show a place-based disparity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the region surrounding a small, diverse Iowa community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within a research partnership framework, we use these maps to engage community residents in discussions of high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We ask how a rural community experiencing higher than expected rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> late-stage diagnosis and mortality perceives and explains their increased risk, interpreting available epidemiological evidence based on their lived experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We use concept mapping to organize these perceptions and situate our findings in the context of previous work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings reveal a complex understanding of risk that should be taken into account in crafting effective public health interventions and messages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our work informs the growing literature on how context influences individual experiences of health problems, with specific relevance for rural populations </plain></SENT>
