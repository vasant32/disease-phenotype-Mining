<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that CTD induces cell cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are no reports showing that CTD would induce cell cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> colo 205 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we studied colo 205 cells which were treated with CTD and demonstrated its molecular mechanisms in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CTD induced growth inhibition, G2/M phase arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in colo 205 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IC50 is 20.53 µM in CTD-treated colo 205 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi>/TUNEL double staining and Annexin V assays were used to confirm the apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in colo 205 cells after CTD exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTD caused G2/M arrest, down-regulated CDK1 activity, decreased Cyclin A, Cyclin B, CDK1 and increased CHK1 and p21 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colorimetric assays also indicated that CTD triggered activities of casapse-8, -9 and -3 in colo 205 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CTD increased ROS production and decreased the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (ΔΨm) in colo 205 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, CTD-induced growth inhibition was significantly attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC, a scavenger) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CTD stimulated the protein levels of Fas/CD95, the caspase-3 active form, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and Bax, but suppressed the protein levels of pro-caspase-8, pro-caspase-9 and Bcl-2, determined by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on our observations, we suggest that CTD is able to induce G2/M phase arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in colo 205 cells through inhibition of CDK1 activity and caspase-dependent signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
