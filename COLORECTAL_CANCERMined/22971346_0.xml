<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To specifically assess the impact of the polymorphic FGFR4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), we engineered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines with distinct endogenous expression patterns to overexpress either the FGFR4(gly) or FGFR4(arg) alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biologic analyses revealed an oncogenic importance for both polymorphic alleles, but FGFR4(gly) was the stronger inducer of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, whereas FGFR4(arg) was the stronger inducer of migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An evaluation of clinical specimens revealed that FGFR4 was upregulated in 20/71 patients independent of gly(388)arg status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the presence of an FGFR4(arg) allele and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> risk in 3,471 participants of the CORSA study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, among 182 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, FGFR4(arg)-carriers had a fivefold higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that were stage II or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, our results established that both allelic forms of FGFR4 exert an oncogenic impact and may serve equally well as therapeutic targets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One important implication of our findings is that FGFR4(arg)-carriers are at a higher risk for more aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and therefore may profit from early detection measures </plain></SENT>
