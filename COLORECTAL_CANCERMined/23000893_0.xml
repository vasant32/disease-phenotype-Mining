<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if this observation is unique to PaC, we compared the prevalence and characteristics of DM in lung, breast, prostate, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> with PaC and noncancer controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 500 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (100 each with lung, breast, prostate, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and PaC) and 100 noncancer controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with PaC (mean age ± SD, 71.6 ± 9.4 years; 53% men) had a significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) higher prevalence of DM (68%) compared to age-matched patients with lung (mean age ± SD, 71.6 ± 9.4 years; 59% men; and 19.6% DM), breast (mean age ± SD, 71.6 ± 9.6 years; 100% women; and 19.4% DM), prostate (mean age ± SD, 71.3 ± 9.4 years; 100% men; and 14.8% DM), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (mean age ± SD, 71.6 ± 9.5 years; 56% men; and 20.7% DM), and noncancer controls (mean age ± SD, 70.7 ± 9.2 years; 57% men; and 23.5% DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with PaC, 40% developed DM in the 36 months preceding the diagnosis of PaC compared with 3.3% to 5.7% in the other groups (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the prevalence of DM in PaC is very high, DM prevalence in other common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> is no different from that in noncancer controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> DM is a phenomenon that is unique to PaC </plain></SENT>
