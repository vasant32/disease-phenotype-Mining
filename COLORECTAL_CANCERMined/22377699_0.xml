<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral administration of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens MDT-1 (MDT-1) on mite antigen-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo> (AD) in NC/Nga mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When administration of the freeze-dried cells of MDT-1 was initiated one week before mite-antigen swabbing, the development of AD-like <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> was alleviated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell homogenate and membrane fraction had similar effects, showing that cell components are effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Freeze-dried cells were found to be replaceable by the crude <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> extracted from MDT-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alleviation of AD was concomitant with a decrease in the serum IgE level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Determination of cytokines produced by Peyer's patch cells showed that MDT-1 administration increased IL-12, tended to increase IFN-Î³, and tended to decrease IL-10, but did not affect IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When MDT-1 was administered after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> had progressed, the symptoms were ameliorated, suggesting that MDT-1 has AD-healing effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MDT-1 was as effective as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, but different from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> in that MDT-1 showed no detectable side effects such as body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that MDT-1 administration prevented and alleviated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, MDT-1 might be beneficial for maintaining the health of pet animals and humans </plain></SENT>
