<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By contrast, it has been reported that the use of bevacizumab prior to or following surgery delays wound healing or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether the administration of bevacizumab following hepatectomy inhibits remnant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> or the growth of remnant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were partially hepatectomized (31% of the liver was removed), transplanted with the murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line, CT26, in the remnant lobe, and intraperitoneally injected with bevacizumab (4 mg/kg) for a total of 6 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum VEGF levels were measured on day 1 following surgery, and each lobe of the liver was weighed on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum VEGF levels in non-hepatectomized, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice exceeded those in their non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing counterparts; however, the administration of bevacizumab did not reduce the serum VEGF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of the liver lobe of the hepatectomized, CT26-transplanted and non-CT26-transplanted mice was 1,349.6 and 735.5 mg, respectively, indicating rapid growth of the CT26 transplant (p=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volume of the CT26-transplanted lobe of the bevacizumab-administered mice was 1,379.0 mg, which was not significantly different from that (1,349.6 mg) of the non-bevacizumab-administered mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volume of the remnant lobe of the bevacizumab-administered mice was 1,051.0 mg, which did not significantly differ from that (957.3 mg) of the non-bevacizumab-administered mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The administration of bevacizumab following hepatectomy did not delay remnant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e>, and did not suppress the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in the remnant lobes or remnant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
