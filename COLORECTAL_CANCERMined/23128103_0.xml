<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the expression of the extracellular matrix (ECM) genes SPARC, SPP1, FN1, ITGA5 and ITGAV and the histopathologic parameters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in 114 patients with stage I-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were performed in samples obtained from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the expression of these markers and the expression of p53, Bcl-2, Ki67, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor was assessed with the Spearman coefficient (r) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ITGAV gene was found to be significantly amplified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with positive perineural invasion (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the SPARC, SPP1, FN1, ITGA5 and ITGAV genes did not correlate with TNM staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A direct relationship between ITGAV and EGFR expression (r = 0.774; p &lt; 0.001) was observed by IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ECM gene expression did not correlate with classical prognostic factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but overexpression of the ITGAV gene and protein was correlated with an increased risk of perineural invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relationship between ITGAV and EGFR expression suggests the possibility of crosstalk in this signal pathway </plain></SENT>
