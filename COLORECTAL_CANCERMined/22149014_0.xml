<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gender differences have been documented among patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is still not clear, however, how these differences have changed over the past 30 years and if these differences vary by geographic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence between 1975 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 373,956 patients ≥40 years diagnosed with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between 1975 and 2006 who resided in one of the nine Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) regions of the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted incidence rates over time were reported by gender, race, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subsite, stage, and SEER region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was diagnosed in roughly equal numbers of men (187,973) and women (185,983) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men had significantly higher age-adjusted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories of age, race, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subsite, stage, and SEER region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gender differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> age-adjusted incidence rates widened slightly from 1975 to 1988, reached a peak in 1985-1988, and have narrowed over time since 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The largest gap and decline in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates between men and women were observed among those ≥80 years (p&lt;0.001), followed by those 70-79 and then 60-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gender differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates for the 40-49 and 50-59 age categories were small and increased only slightly over time (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> age-adjusted incidence among men than among women has persisted over the past 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although gender differences narrowed in the population ≥60 years, especially from 1990 to 2006, gender gaps, albeit small ones, in those younger than 60 increased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies may need to examine the factors associated with these differences and explore ways to narrow the gender gap </plain></SENT>
