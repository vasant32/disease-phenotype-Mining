<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further data are needed to determine the safety of bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recorded grade 3, 4, or 5 ATE events and other data (including age, baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, history of ATE, and aspirin use) from 471 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> in the MAX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25357">Mitomycin</z:chebi>, Avastin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Xeloda</z:chebi>) trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> monotherapy versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> with bevacizumab with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bevacizumab-treated patients had 12 grade 3, 4, or 5 ATEs (3.8% incidence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATEs occurred in 2.1% of patients &gt;65 years, 5% of those with a history of ATE, and 5% of those with cardiac risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, history of ATE, or vascular risk factors did not increase risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aspirin users had a higher incidence than nonusers (8.9% versus 2.7%) but had higher rates of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab was associated with a modestly higher risk of ATE, but safety was not significantly worse in older patients or patients with a history of ATE or vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of aspirin in preventing ATE in patients receiving bevacizumab could not be determined from this study </plain></SENT>
