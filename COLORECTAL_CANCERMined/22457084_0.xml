<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the study was to a the impact of these parameters on the survival of Stage IIa <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, focusing on the prognostic value of the number of harvested lymph nodes (NHLN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Out of 651 CRC patients undergoing surgical resection, 204 T3-N0-M0 were selected and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were adapted for the evaluation of the prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5 years actuarial DFS, DSS, and OS rates of patients with a NHLN &gt;12 were significantly better compared to those of patients with a NHLN &lt;12 (respectively: 72.8% vs. 50.4% P=0.001; 82% vs. 56% P=0.001; 78.5% vs. 53.1% P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that a NHLN &gt;12 was the only independent parameter of statistical significance influencing DFS, DSS, and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, the NHLN is the main predictor of survival in Stage IIa <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This would appear to suggest the need of a better stratification of Stage IIa <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, sub-dividing patients with more or less than 12 NHLN </plain></SENT>
