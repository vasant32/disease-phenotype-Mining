<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Colonoscopy is associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> but may be more effective in reducing the risk of distal than proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the differences between proximal and distal colon endoscopic performance, we conducted a case-control study of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, the primary targets of colorectal endoscopy screening, and sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (SSPs), newly recognized precursor lesions for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> subset that occurs most often in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Group Health-based study population included 213 advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cases, 172 SSP cases, and 1,704 controls aged 50-79 years, who received an index colonoscopy from 1998-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants completed a structured questionnaire covering endoscopy history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> underwent a standard pathology review to confirm the diagnosis and reclassify a subset as advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or SSPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between endoscopy and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and SSPs separately; site-specific analyses were completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Previous endoscopy was inversely associated with advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in both the rectum/distal colon (OR=0.38; 95% CI: 0.26-0.56) and proximal colon (OR=0.31; 95% CI: 0.19-0.52), but there was no statistically significant association between previous endoscopy and SSPs (OR=0.80; 95%CI: 0.56-1.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the effect of endoscopy differs between advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and SSPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may have implications for proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> prevention and be due to the failure of endoscopy to detect/remove SSPs, or the hypothesized rapid development of SSPs </plain></SENT>
