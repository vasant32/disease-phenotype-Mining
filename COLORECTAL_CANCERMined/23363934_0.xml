<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its accuracy has been improved with the hybrid PET/computed tomography (CT) technique because of precise anatomic location of areas of abnormal FDG accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This integrated PET/CT modality has been widely adopted, particularly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Special attention is paid to preoperative diagnostic workup, evaluation of treatment response and survival prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experience from specialized centers indicates that there is strong evidence for the clinical effectiveness of FDG-PET/CT in staging, restaging and the prediction of response to therapy in the above-mentioned <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that this imaging modality contributes considerably to improved patient management and paves the way to personalize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment in a cost-effective way </plain></SENT>
