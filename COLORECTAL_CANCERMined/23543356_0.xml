<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the underlying mechanism of Jianpi Jiedu Recipe (, JJR) in the reversion of multidrug resistance concerning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice were treated orally with JJR at a daily 4.25 g/(kg kg��day) or injected with vinblastine (VCR) 2.5 mg/(kg kg·day) for 3 weeks after having been inoculated with HCT8/V cells; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues were assayed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the effects of JJR on the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and COX-2 gene silenced by siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the variation of intracellular concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (L-OHP) was evaluated by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-ICPMS) in HCT8/V and its COX-2 siRNA cells; the concentration of JJR combined with chemotherapeutic drugs MS) and the reverse effect of multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) in HCT8/V cells was evaluated by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and P-gp expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: JJR had an inhibitory effect on the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>: in vivo, and it, in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, could reverse the drug-resistance of HCT8/V cells and increase the sensitivity of HCT8/V cells to VCR, DDP, 5-Fu, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICP-MS results showed that JJR could increase the concentration of drugs in HCT8/V cells (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was shown that JJR could reverse drug resistance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells by decreasing MDR1 expression and P-gp level via downregulation of COX-2, which has been represented as one of the major mechanisms that contributes to the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> phenotype (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: JJR reversed multidrug resistance and enhanced the sensitivity to chemotherapy, which could be attributed to the down-regulation of COX-2 in MDR1/P-gp-mediated <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
