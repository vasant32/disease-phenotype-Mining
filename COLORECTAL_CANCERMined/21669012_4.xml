<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific VEGF polymorphisms may affect gene transcription and therefore indirectly influence the efficacy of bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA of 111 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with first-line FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab was obtained from blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VEGF -2578 C/A, -1498 C/T, + 405 C/G, + 936 C/T polymorphisms were analyzed by means of PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA samples from 107 patients treated with FOLFIRI alone served as historical control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relation of VEGF polymorphisms with PFS, evaluated through Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, was the primary end-point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An interaction test with a Cox model has been performed in order to demonstrate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the effect of VEGF -1498 C/T polymorphism between bevacizumab-and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the bevacizumab-group median PFS and OS of patients carrying VEGF -1498 C/C, C/T and T/T allelic variants were, respectively, 12.8, 10.5, 7.5 months (p = 0.0046, log-rank test) and 27.3, 20.5, 18.6 months (p = 0.038, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VEGF -1498 T/T genotype was associated with shorter PFS (HR = 2.13, [1.41-5.10], p = 0.0027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the control group no significant association of VEGF -1498 C/T allelic variants and PFS or OS was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interaction between VEGF -1498 C/T variants and treatment effect suggested that the relation of VEGF -1498 T/T genotype with shorter PFS was caused by the effect of bevacizumab (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other investigated polymorphisms did not affect the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a possible role for VEGF -1498 C/T variants in predicting the efficacy of bevacizumab in the up-front treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A molecular tool for selecting subjects candidate to benefit from the anti-VEGF could be important for clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The retrospective and exploratory design of the present study, coupled with the non-randomized nature of the comparison between treated and untreated patients, imply that these results should be considered as hypothesis generators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A prospective validating trial is currently ongoing </plain></SENT>
