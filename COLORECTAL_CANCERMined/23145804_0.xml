<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare completion rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests within a health maintenance organization before and after widespread adoption of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using electronic medical records of 113,901 patients eligible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, we examined test completion during 2 successive time periods among those who received an automated screening outreach call </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time periods were: 1) the "guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) era," a 15-month period during which only gFOBT was routinely offered, and 2) a 9-month "FIT era," when only a new FIT was routinely offered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to analyzing completion rates, we analyzed the impact of practice-level variables and patient-level variables on overall screening completion during the 2 different observation periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The change from gFOBT to FIT in an integrated care delivery system increased the likelihood of screening completion by 7.7% overall, and the likelihood of screening with a fecal test by 8.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The greatest gains in screening completion using FIT were among women and elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Completion of FIT was not as strongly associated with medical office visits or with having a primary care provider as was screening with gFOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of FIT within an integrated care system increased completion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening tests within a 9-month assessment period, compared with a previous 15-month gFOBT era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher completion rates of the FIT may allow for more effective dissemination of programs to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening through centralized outreach programs </plain></SENT>
