<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment is the only option for long-term survival in patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CRLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are usually used for preoperative liver imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial surgical strategy for liver resection is based upon these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further optimization of the surgical strategy by contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasound (CE-IOUS) might further improve the surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the current impact of CE-IOUS with SonoVue(Â®) on the initial surgical strategy for CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-six consecutive patients undergoing open liver resection for CRLM were evaluated retrospectively over a 2.5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent 97 operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative staging was performed with contrast-enhanced CT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and MRI was available in 66 of 86 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CE-IOUS was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients according to a standardized examination technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Curved array and linear transducers were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CRLM were identified in venous phase as hypovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CE-IOUS findings were compared with preoperative staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combined CT/MRI identified preoperatively 328 CRLM (mean 3.4, range 0-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two additional lesions (18%) were identified in 38 patients during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively 41 additional CRLM in 20 patients were identified by inspection, palpation, and CE-IOUS (10%), and another 31 CRLM in 17 patients were identified by CE-IOUS alone (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> additional CRLM detected by CE-IOUS were confirmed by histology if resection was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CE-IOUS changed planned operation strategy in 29.9% of operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A larger resection was necessary in 13.4% of the cases, reduced liver resection was found sufficient in 11.3%, and 5.2% were found inoperable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>For patients diagnosed preoperatively with solitary lesions CE-IOUS changed operation strategy in 19% and radical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection would have failed in 4.8% without CE-IOUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CE-IOUS is essential to ensure optimal and complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection both in patient with solitary CRLM and multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
