<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few to be available in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">Thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) regulates the phosphorolysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> and 2-deoxy-d-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>-1-phosphate which is essential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether TPI augments the radiotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in vitro and in vivo studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of TPI with irradiation on HT29 and HCT116 cells was examined using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>- and colony formation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 10days post-inoculation, HT29 bearing orthotopic model mice (n=28) were divided into four groups and orally treated with TPI- (50mg/kg/day for 2weeks), radiation (RT, 2Gy×4: Total 8Gy), their combination or the vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the efficacy were assessed genomically and immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to each single treatment, the combination of TPI and RT synergistically inhibited the cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the HT-29 bearing mice, the combination of TPI and RT reduced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> compared with RT alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of VEGF, TGF-β and, Rad51 and the protein expressions of VEGF and CD34 were significantly lower in the combination than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the combination markedly increased the TUNEL-positive cells, suggesting that TPI augments the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and DNA repair system in the radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study first demonstrated that the combination of TPI and irradiation was effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TPI would provide a promising therapeutic strategy as a radiosensitizer </plain></SENT>
