<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the roles of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> in neuronal asymmetry regulation in vertebrates, we studied zebrafish anterior dorsal telencephalon (ADt) neuronal axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We generated transgenic zebrafish animals expressing the photo-convertible fluorescent protein Kaede in ADt neurons and then photo-converted Kaede to label specifically the ADt neuron axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that ADt axons normally project ventrally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knock down of Dcc function by injecting antisense morpholino oligonucleotides caused the ADt neurons to project axons dorsally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To examine the axon projection pattern of individual ADt neurons, we labeled single ADt neurons using a forebrain-specific promoter to drive fluorescent protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that individual ADt neurons projected axons dorsally or formed multiple processes after morpholino knock down of Dcc function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further found that knock down of the Dcc ligand, Netrin1, also caused ADt neurons to project axons dorsally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of Neogenin1, a guidance receptor closely related to Dcc, enhanced the formation of aberrant dorsal axons in embryos injected with Dcc morpholino </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These experiments provide the first evidence that Dcc regulates polarized axon initiation and asymmetric outgrowth of forebrain neurons in vertebrates </plain></SENT>
