<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated first-line panitumumab plus FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm study, panitumumab (6 mg/kg) and FOLFIRI [irinotecan (180 mg/m(2)) and leucovorin (400 mg/m(2)) followed by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> 400 mg/m(2) bolus and a 2,400-3,000 mg/m(2) continuous infusion] were administered every 14 days until progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed descriptively overall and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> KRAS status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS data were available for 145/154 (94%) patients: 59% KRAS WT and 41% mutant (MT); mean follow-up was 39.5 versus 35.8 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Objective responses occurred in 49% of patients: 56% versus 38% in the KRAS WT versus MT groups [(18% difference (95% CI 1-35%); odds ratio 2.1 (95% CI 1.0-4.4)]; median duration of response was 13.0 versus 7.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More patients in the WT group underwent R0 resection (8% vs. 5%); median progression-free survival also favoured this group (8.9 vs. 7.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events (any grade) were integument toxicities (98%), diarrhoea (79%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral mucositis</z:e> (51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As expected, consistently favourable efficacy was observed in patients with KRAS WT versus MT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> receiving first-line panitumumab plus FOLFIRI treatment </plain></SENT>
