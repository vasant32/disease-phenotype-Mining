<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there are fewer data on complete mesocolic excision (CME) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Database were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This includes about 95% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients having elective surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> in the period 2001-2008 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall and relative survival analyses were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study period was divided into the periods 2001-2004 and 2005-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 9149 patients were included for the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival rates were 0.65 in 2001-2004 and 0.66 in 2005-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative 5-year survival rates were also within 1% of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of these comparisons was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survival following elective <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> surgery has been almost unchanged since 2001 </plain></SENT>
