<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (WT) KRAS mutation status is predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response with epidermal growth factor receptor-directed therapies, but the results from studies evaluating the prognostic value of KRAS status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> have been contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of KRAS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, specifically according to whether patients have synchronous or metachronous disease at presentation, is less understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-hundred ten consecutive patients with metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> underwent testing for KRAS exon 2 mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct nucleotide sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of these patients were then analyzed retrospectively, stratified according to whether patients presented with synchronous or metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and according to KRAS mutation status (WT or mutated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the entire cohort, the median overall survival from the date of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> was 34.3 months (95% confidence interval, 28.3-49.4 months) for patients with WT KRAS (n = 70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival for patients with mutated KRAS (n = 40) was 40.3 months (95% confidence interval, 27.9-51.1 months; log-rank P = .91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that 3-year overall survival and 5-year overall survival were not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the subgroups of patients with synchronous and metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, no significant differences were observed in median overall survival, 3-year overall survival, or 5-year overall survival between the WT KRAS and mutated KRAS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, KRAS mutation status did not influence overall survival in either synchronous or metachronous metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and, as such, had no prognostic role in this disease setting </plain></SENT>
