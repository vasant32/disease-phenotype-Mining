<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The precise contribution of IORT to the management of locally advanced and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the value of IORT in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies published between 1965 and 2011 that reported outcomes after IORT for advanced or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified by an electronic literature search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies were assessed for methodological quality and design, and evaluated for technique of IORT delivery, oncological outcomes, and complications following IORT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were analysed with fixed-effect and random-effect model meta-analyses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and publication bias examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 29 studies comprising 14 prospective and 15 retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed, yielding a total of 3003 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The indication for IORT was locally advanced disease in 1792 patients and locally <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> in 1211 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in methodology and reporting practice, IORT is principally applied for the treatment of close or positive margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When comparative studies were evaluated, a significant effect favouring improved local control (OR 0.22; 95% CI = 0.05-0.86; p = 0.03), disease free survival (HR 0.51; 95% CI = 0.31-0.85; p = 0.009), and overall survival (HR 0.33; 95% CI = 0.2-0.54; p = 0.001) was noted with no increase in total (OR 1.13; 95% CI = 0.77-1.65; p = 0.57), urologic (OR 1.35; 95% CI = 0.84-2.82; p = 0.47), or anastomotic complications (OR 0.94; 95% CI = 0.42-2.1; p = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased wound complications were noted after IORT (OR 1.86; 95% CI = 1.03-3.38; p = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite methodological weaknesses in the studies evaluated, our results suggest that IORT may improve oncological outcomes in advanced and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
