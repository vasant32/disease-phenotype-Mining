<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: This study searched Medline, Medline (R) In-Process, Embase and Cochrane Library databases for studies on IRs associated with chemotherapy and mAbs in mCRC patients from 2000-2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: For chemotherapy, the incidence of IRs ranged from 0-71% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades and 0-15% for grade 3-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grade IRs associated with cetuximab ranged from 7.6-33% and grade 3-4 IR rates were 0-22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grade IRs associated with panitumumab ranged from 0-4% and rates of grade 3-4 IRs ranged from 0-1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of IRs associated with bevacizumab ranged from 1.6-11%, with a rate of 0-4% for grade 3-4 IRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A range of 50-100% of patients with grade 3-4 IRs terminated chemotherapy, and 34-100% of cetuximab patients with grade 3-4 IRs discontinued cetuximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No data were reported for bevacizumab or panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one study evaluated the economic impact of IRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study compared cetuximab administrations without an IR to those with an IR requiring resource utilization and found that mean costs were $9308, and $1725 higher for those with an IR requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization and for those with an IR requiring outpatient treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The incidence of IRs varies among different mAbs; and IRs may cause treatment disruption and require costly medical interventions </plain></SENT>
