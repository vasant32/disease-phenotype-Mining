<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: As <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survival rates improve, there is growing interest in the role of lifestyle in longer-term health and quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the prevalence of health-related behaviours, and the associations between health behaviours and QoL, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> within the last 5 years identified from five London (UK) hospitals (N = 495) completed a survey that included measures of fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) intake, physical activity, smoking status and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire was used to index QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of respondents were overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (58%), not physically active (&lt;5 bouts of moderate activity per week; 82%) and ate fewer than five portions of F&amp;V a day (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Few were smokers (6%) or heavy drinkers (weekly alcohol units &gt;21 for men and &gt;14 for women; 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physical activity showed the strongest association with functional QoL and was also associated with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, pain and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>F&amp;V intake was associated with higher global QoL and physical, role and cognitive function (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a total health behaviour score (calculated by assigning one point for each of the following behaviours: not smoking, consuming â‰¥5 portions of F&amp;V a day, being physically active and having moderate alcohol consumption), there was a linear relationship with global QoL, physical function and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors in the UK have suboptimal health behaviours, and this is associated with poorer QoL </plain></SENT>
