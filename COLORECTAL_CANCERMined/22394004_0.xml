<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the effect of MDR1 polymorphisms on its expression level and related characteristics in Iranian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal tissue and blood samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and blood samples from healthy controls (n=60) were obtained for genotyping and measuring the expression level of MDR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of the MDR1 gene showed a significant increase in cancerous regions compared to adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the GG2677 genotype was correlated with highest while the AT 2677 genotype was associated with the lowest levels of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition only the G2677T/A polymorphism showed association with histological grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study once more emphasizes effects of MDR1 SNPs which may indirectly impact on response to drugs </plain></SENT>
