<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To find out as to what extent the treatment selection based on the KRAS status had impact on overall costs, a retrospective analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 73 mCRC patients 31.5% were MUT carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Costs of EGFR inhibitor treatment for WT patients were significantly higher compared to those for patients with MUT (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher treatment costs in WT carriers reflect a significantly higher number of treatment cycles (p = 0.012) in this cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Savings of drug costs minus the costs for the determination of KRAS status accounted for EUR 779.42 (SD Â±336.28) per patient per cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The routine use of KRAS screening is a cost-effective strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Costs of unnecessary monoclonal EGFR inhibitor treatment can be saved in MUT patients </plain></SENT>
