<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define overall 5-year survival of screen detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and to compare the overall survival outcome of screened vs symptomatic patients over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated at one trust in patients of screening age (50-69 years) during the pilot screening programme (2000-2008) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were defined as screen detected or symptomatically detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease pathology and recurrence data were obtained from the hospital's computerized results reporting system and mortality was cross-matched with data from the West Midlands <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Intelligence Network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 633 patients aged 50-69 were identified in the study period; 155 patients had a screen detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and 478 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A log-rank test completed on survival outcomes indicated that survival was significantly worse in the symptomatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference persisted if only patients treated with curative intent were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survival outcome was significantly better in the screened vs the symptomatic population in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and also in those treated for curative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards better survival for screen detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> when compared stage for stage </plain></SENT>
