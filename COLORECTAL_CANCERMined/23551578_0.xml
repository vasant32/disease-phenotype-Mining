<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise role of NRP1 and NRP2 in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence (ACS) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains unclear, and we aimed to determine this in surgical specimens comprising the ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Histological analysis demonstrated that epithelial NRP1 expression increased significantly across the ACS (P = 0.0007), and correlated with microvessel density (MVD; r = 0.505, P = 0.0003) and weakly with VEGF (r = 0.251, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, although NRP2 epithelial expression was increased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.002), there was no correlation with MVD, VEGF or NRP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients showing coexpression of NRP1 and NRP2 had a potentially worse prognosis than those expressing a single neuropilin or neither one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although vascular expression of NRP1 increased significantly across the ACS (P = 0.0004) and correlated with MVD (r = 0.361, P = 0.0006), NRP2 vascular expression decreased significantly (P = 0.0001) and showed an inverse correlation with MVD (r=-0.506, P = 0.0001), suggesting differential roles for neuropilins in the angiogenic process during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that an increase in NRP1 and NRP2 epithelial/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> expression, as well as in NRP1 vascular expression, may be associated with disease progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
