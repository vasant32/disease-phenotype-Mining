<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously established a three-dimensional (3-D) colonic crypt model using HKe3 cells which are human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) HCT116 cells with a disruption in oncogenic KRAS, and revealed the crucial roles of oncogenic KRAS both in inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and in disruption of cell polarity; however, the molecular mechanism of KRAS-induced these 3-D specific biological changes remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the genes that were upregulated by oncogenic KRAS in this model, we focused on the phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) of which expression levels were found to be higher in clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients in comparison to those from healthy control in the public datasets of gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PDE4B2 was specifically overexpressed among other PDE4 isoforms, and re-expression of oncogenic KRAS in HKe3 cells resulted in PDE4B overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the inhibition of PDE4 catalytic activity using rolipram reverted the disorganization of HCT116 cells into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiologic state of the epithelial cell polarity by inducing the apical assembly of ZO-1 (a tight junction marker) and E-cadherin (an adherens junction marker) and by increasing the activity of caspase-3 (an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> marker) in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cavities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, rolipram reduced the AKT phosphorylation, which is known to be associated with the disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cavity formation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were also obtained using PDE4B2-shRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, increased expression of PDE4B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was found to be correlated with relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a public datasets of gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results collectively suggested that PDE4B is upregulated by oncogenic KRAS, and also that the inhibition of PDE4 catalytic activity can induce both epithelial cell polarity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, thus highlighting the utility of our 3-D culture (3 DC) model for the KRAS-induced development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 3-D microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, using this model, we found that PDE4B is a promising candidate for a therapeutic target as well as prognostic molecular marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further elucidation of the signaling network of PDE4B2 in 3 DC would provide a better understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
