<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> has been reported to increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, which may due to aberrant <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>And recently findings of monoacylglycerol lipase provide a novel evidence in the correlation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So in this study, we investigated the effect of MAGL in regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MAGL expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues was estimated, and then JZL184 and siRNA were used to knockdown the expression of MAGL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell viability and invasion were detected to estimate the influence of MAGL knocked down in vitro and vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then cell proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell cycle transition and screening of candidate genes were performed for further exploring of the effect mediated by MAGL knocked down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was noted that the expression of MAGL was highly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues, however, it was found only significantly correlated with the BMI index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells' growth and invasion was significantly inhibited in vitro and in vivo induced by pharmacological and siRNA mediated MAGL knocked down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was reduced and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And two target genes Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 seemed to be repressed by MAGL knocked down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells growth can be inhibited via knockdown of MAGL, which manipulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by downregulation of Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It provides a novel therapeutic target in treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and a further support for the correlation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
