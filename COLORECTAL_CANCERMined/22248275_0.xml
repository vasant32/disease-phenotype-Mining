<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The second aim was to study whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the liver parenchyma remnant after could influence the postoperative course large liver resections in long-term chemotherapy within complex therapy of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>.The prospective study comprised of 43 patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> in whom liver resections of 4-5 segments were planned (Table 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent complex therapy of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, including chemotherapy consisting of 6-12 therapeutic cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time interval between chemotherapy and liver resection was 2-24 months (mean interval of 8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients whose presumed liver parenchyma remnant was less than 40% of total liver volume were indicated for portal vein embolization (mean liver parenchyma remnant of 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was always embolization of the right portal branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients were primarily indicated to liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>Hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the left liver lobe occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After portal vein embolization, the volume of left liver increased on average from 476 ml (282-754) to 584 ml (380-892) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of left liver lobe after portal vein embolization was 28.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The measured parenchyma remnant after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection increased from 29% up to 38% by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean values of ALT and AST in the postoperative period were significantly different in the groups in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The values of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma glutamyl</z:chebi> transpeptidase (GMT) were lower in patients after portal vein embolization (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
