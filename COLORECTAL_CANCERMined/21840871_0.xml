<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, among cases that do not respond well to first-line chemotherapy, it is rare that second-line chemotherapy results in a marked response allowing liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We consider that the liver resection rate may be increased by initiating second-line treatment at an earlier stage before progression subsequent to first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We are conducting a multicentre Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential chemotherapy using six cycles of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, folinic acid and irinotecan) followed by six cycles of bevacizumab plus FOLFOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, folinic acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) as conversion chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is the liver resection rate during the bevacizumab + FOLFOX phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients are required for this study </plain></SENT>
