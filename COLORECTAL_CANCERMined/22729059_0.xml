<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that a colonoscopy withdrawal time of at least 6 minutes is associated with an increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate in patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We aimed to determine colonoscopy withdrawal time and rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection in a blinded study--conducted at Christchurch Hospital (Christchurch, New Zealand)--to determine if there was a relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 16 consultant endoscopists performing colonoscopy in a tertiary hospital had their withdrawal time from the caecum prospectively timed over 208 consecutive procedures between 11 April 2007 and 19 May 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following data was collected: indication for procedure, final diagnosis, polypectomy rate, procedures performed and withdrawal time were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histology results were reviewed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 111 (53%) of colonoscopies were performed for symptom assessment and 97 (47%) for surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between colonoscopists' withdrawal times (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> were diagnosed in 65 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopies (31.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the screening colonoscopies <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were found in 38 (39.1%) of which 14 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate of 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median colonoscopy withdrawal time was 3 minutes 16 seconds when no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were found (range 5 seconds to 11 minutes 50 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median colonoscopy time when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were found was 8 minutes 31 seconds which included time taken for procedures (range 2 minutes 7 seconds to 35 minutes 40 seconds), p&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>COCNLUSIONS: This study confirms that more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were found by those endoscopists who had slower withdrawal times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also colonoscopy withdrawal times are inherently much faster than recommended and highlights the importance of regular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate and withdrawal time auditing </plain></SENT>
