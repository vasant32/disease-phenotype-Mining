<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to miRNA dysregulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by carrying out high-resolution ChIP-seq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we conducted genome-wide profiling of trimethylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), trimethylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and dimethylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 lysine 79 (H3K79me2) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combining miRNA expression profiles with chromatin signatures enabled us to predict the active promoters of 233 miRNAs encoded in 174 putative primary transcription units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By then comparing miRNA expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification before and after DNA demethylation, we identified 47 miRNAs encoded in 37 primary transcription units as potential targets of epigenetic silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The promoters of 22 transcription units were associated with CpG islands (CGI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were hypermethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA demethylation led to increased H3K4me3 marking at silenced miRNA genes, whereas no restoration of H3K79me2 was detected in CGI-methylated miRNA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA demethylation also led to upregulation of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in a number of CGI-methylated miRNA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the miRNAs we found to be dysregulated, many of which are implicated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, miR-1-1 was methylated frequently in early and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in which it may act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings offer insight into the association between chromatin signatures and miRNA dysregulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and they also suggest that miRNA reexpression may contribute to the effects of epigenetic therapy </plain></SENT>
