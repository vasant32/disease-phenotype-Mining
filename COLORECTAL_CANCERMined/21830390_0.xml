<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: By detecting telomerase activity of surgical specimens using the TRAP method, 251 cases diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were allocated to the telomerase-dependent and telomerase-independent groups, as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression difference of hRad21 between the two groups was investigated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed-up and clinicopathological features were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 38 and 213 cases in the telomerase-independent and telomerase-dependent groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of hRad21 in the telomerase-independent group is higher than that in the telomerase-dependent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological analysis indicated that invasion of the rectal wall (T stage) in the telomerase-independent group was more superficial than that in the telomerase group (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, serum CEA, CA19-9, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, TNM stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation showed no difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up indicated a significantly shortened survival time in the telomerase-dependent group (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (84.9%) maintain their telomeres by telomerase, while a minority (15.1%) do so by telomerase-independent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Depth of invasion in the telomerase-independent group was lower than that the telomerase group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up indicated that patients of telomerase-independent group had a higher survival rate than that of telomerase-dependent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Expression of hRad21 in telomerase-independent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is higher than that of telomerase-dependent group, which suggested that hRad21 may be an important protein involved in telomerase-independent telomere maintenance mechanisms </plain></SENT>
