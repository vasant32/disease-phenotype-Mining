<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Mutations of KRAS and BRAF genes represent molecular biomarkers of response to targeted therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since these mutations have been shown to exert different biological effects and impacts on patients' outcome, there is a need to determine reliably the frequency and types of KRAS mutations for diagnostic and individual therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite having a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (wt) KRAS, some patients fail to respond to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BRAF V600E mutation is an additional molecular determinant of response to the same therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we described the KRAS and the BRAF V600E mutation spectra and frequencies in a group of Serbian mCRC specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: KRAS mutations were determined with DxS TheraScreen® K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> Mutation Kit and KRAS StripAssay(™), and for the BRAF V600E mutation we applied High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutations were present in 34.7% of 190 analyzed samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 7 most frequent mutation types observed were: G12D 43.9%, G12V 21.2%, G12A 10.6%, G12C 7.6%, G12S 4.5%, G12R 1.5%, G13D 10.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the wt KRAS patients, 17.8% carried the BRAF V600E mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the spectrum and frequency distribution of the identified KRAS and BRAF mutations in Serbian study population are in good accordance with literature data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that our results are significant concerning aspects related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> molecular biology as well as to patient selection in the diagnostic settings </plain></SENT>
