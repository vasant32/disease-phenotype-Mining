<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the Pleckstrin and Sec7 domain-containing (PSD) gene is preferentially methylated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), and is implicated in UC-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> through its inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the potential effect of PSD methylation on its downstream molecule, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), which governs neutrophil chemotaxis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PSD was knocked down in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human fibroblast cell line (HNDF) and a neutrophil-like cell line (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both NHDF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells exhibited numerous filamentous-actin (F-actin) rich membrane extensions, resulting in the activation of Rac1; this activation was hampered by PSD silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">Lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducer, stimulated NHDF cells to release ROS and activated caspaseâ€‘3/7 in the presence of neutrophils, which was inhibited by PSD knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Migration assays demonstrated that chemotaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells was affected by PSD silencing in NHDF cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections from 6 UC patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 15 UC patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To verify Rac1-mediated chemotaxis in tissue sections, we evaluated the grade of neutrophil infiltration by histological assessment and assessed F-actin and PSD expression by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration, F-actin and PSD expression were significantly decreased in specimens from UC patients with PSD methylation compared with those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of F-actin expression were observed in colorectal mucosa, as well as in infiltrating cells with PSD methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PSD expression was preferentially inhibited in colorectal mucosa by PSD methylation, whereas PSD expression was rarely observed in infiltrating cells, regardless of PSD methylation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that aberrant methylation of PSD occurs in UC-associated colorectal mucosa, enabling circumvention of Rac1-mediated immune responses governing neutrophil chemotaxis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and thus plays a pivotal role in the mechanisms underlying UC-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
