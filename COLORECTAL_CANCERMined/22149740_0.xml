<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Faecal immunochemical tests (FIT) are becoming widely used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Estimation of faecal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration in a large group prompted an observational study on gender and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single estimate of faecal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was made using quantitative automated immunoturbidimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential reference intervals were calculated for men and women and for age quintiles according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Approved Guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentages of positive results were calculated at a number of concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages of individuals who fell into different risk groups were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 97.5 percentiles, potential upper reference limits, were 519 ng <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>/mL (90% CI: 468-575) for men and 283 ng <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>/mL (90% CI: 257-316) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentrations increased with age in both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decision limits have advantages over reference intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At any cut-off concentration, more men are declared positive than women and more older people are declared positive than younger people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is higher in men than in women and in older people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Faecal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations vary with gender and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More tailored strategies are needed in screening programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Faecal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration could be included in individual risk assessment scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These data should assist in screening programme design </plain></SENT>
