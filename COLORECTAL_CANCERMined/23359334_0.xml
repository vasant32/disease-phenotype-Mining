<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The PTEN is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene located on chromosome 10q23.3 and established to play key role in the varied types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the possible effect of mutations and inactivation of PTEN gene on the occurrence and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), 223 cancer specimens were selected to probe PTEN gene mutations through the micro dissection of the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods were applied for mutations while protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in exons 7 and 8 of PTEN were observed in 12.5% and PTEN loss of expression was identified in 48% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In exon 7, we found the insertion of "G" resulted into the change at codon 218 from TGC to GTC leading to change in the reading frame starting downward from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">Cystein</z:chebi> to Valine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the insertion of "A" in the same exon at codon 213 resulted into the change of codon CCT to CCA, which cause silent mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In exon 8, however, "A" is replaced by C at codon 282, but both encodes for Glycine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant loss of PTEN expression was observed in cancerous tissue when compared with the adjacent control (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, weak PTEN expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues were significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, depth of invasion, lymphatic invasion, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, grade of differentiation, and TNM stage (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that PTEN gene mutation and loss of PTEN expression may provide valuable prognostic information to aid treatment strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
