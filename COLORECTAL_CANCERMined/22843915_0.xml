<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prospectively archived records of 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> that received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight men and 12 women, of median age 58 (range 35-77) years, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median spleen volume ratios were 1.3-fold after 6 cycles and 1.9-fold after 12 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> was 30% after 6 cycles and 67% after 12 cycles, and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was 70% after 6 cycles, 82% after 9 cycles, and 80% after 12 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was found to be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and this pattern was notable after 6 cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Splenic enlargement and reduction in platelet counts were common during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these changes were found to occur rapidly after 6 cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
