<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic use of recombinant human G-CSF such as daily filgrastim and once-per-cycle pegfilgrastim may reduce the incidence of febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This comparative study examined the effect of pegfilgrastim versus daily filgrastim on the risk of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective United States claims analysis utilized 2004-2009 data for filgrastim- and pegfilgrastim-treated patients receiving chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) or breast, lung, ovarian, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cycles in which pegfilgrastim or filgrastim was administered within 5 days from initiation of chemotherapy (considered to represent prophylaxis) were pooled for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>Neutropenia</z:hpo>-related hospitalization and other healthcare encounters were defined with a "narrow" criterion for claims with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and with a "broad" criterion for claims with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) for hospitalization and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by generalized estimating equation (GEE) models and adjusted for patient, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and treatment characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Per-cycle healthcare utilization and costs were examined for cycles with pegfilgrastim or filgrastim prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 3,535 patients receiving G-CSF prophylaxis, representing 12,056 chemotherapy cycles (11,683 pegfilgrastim, 373 filgrastim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of filgrastim prophylaxis in the sample was 4.8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of pegfilgrastim prophylaxis in the sample was 1.0 day, consistent with the recommended dosage of pegfilgrastim - a single injection once per chemotherapy cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cycles with prophylactic pegfilgrastim were associated with a decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>-related hospitalization (narrow definition: OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.16-1.13; broad definition: OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.24-0.59) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause hospitalization (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.35-0.72) versus cycles with prophylactic filgrastim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>-related utilization by setting of care, there were more ambulatory visits and hospitalizations per cycle associated with filgrastim prophylaxis than with pegfilgrastim prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean per-cycle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>-related costs were also higher with prophylactic filgrastim than with prophylactic pegfilgrastim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this comparative effectiveness study, pegfilgrastim prophylaxis was associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>-related or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause hospitalization relative to filgrastim prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
