<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 90 samples of surgically resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues for APC and CDKN2A promoter methylation using methylation sensitive-high resolution melting (MS-HRM) and pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MS-HRM is a less expensive technique compared with pyrosequencing but is usually more limited because it gives a range of methylation estimates rather than a single value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we developed a method for deriving single estimates, rather than a range, of methylation using MS-HRM and compared the values obtained in this way with those obtained using the gold standard quantitative method of pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We derived an interpolation curve using standards of known methylated/unmethylated ratio (0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of methylation) to obtain the best estimate of the extent of methylation for each of our samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed similar profiles of methylation and a high correlation coefficient between the two techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, our new approach allows MS-HRM to be used as a quantitative assay which provides results which are comparable with those obtained by pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
