<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A range of treatments are available for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An initial period without active treatment, a 'watch and wait approach', is variably employed in routine practice; however, there is no data to support this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected data regarding clinician treatment recommendations for patients with newly diagnosed mCRC in addition to subsequent treatment and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up and management was according to standard protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty-six patients (59.1% male, 40.9% female) with mCRC (January 2003-December 2010) were analysed; the median age was 67.9 years (range 26.2-95.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and seventy-seven patients (51.2%) received immediate chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 133 (18.1%), treatment was considered inappropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>34 patients (4.6%) declined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For 192 (26.1%), a watch and wait policy was adopted and 168 (87.5%) of these received treatment, at a median of 3.7 months (range 2-35 months) from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients immediately treated, the number receiving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> active chemotherapy agents (30.4 versus 39.3%) was similar and median survival (27 versus 17 months, P = 0.0008) was superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that a substantial minority of patients underwent an initial watch and wait approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, they received a similar treatment exposure to patients treated immediately and the survival outcomes were not compromised </plain></SENT>
