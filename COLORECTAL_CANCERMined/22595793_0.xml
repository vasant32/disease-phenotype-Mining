<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have isolated and characterized a novel variant of the replication-competent oncolytic HSV1716 that expresses inhibitor of growth 4 (Ing4) (HSV1716Ing4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that Ing4 expression enhances progeny output during HSV1716 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells both in vitro and in vivo, thereby significantly augmenting its oncolytic potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In tissue culture, compared with HSV1716, HSV1716Ing4 produced significantly higher numbers of infectious progeny in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>), breast, ovarian, prostate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediate-early expression of Ing4 was crucial for this effect and an intact Ing4 was required as there was no enhanced progeny production with HSV1716 variants that expressed Ing4 mutants lacking the C-terminal plant homeodomain domain or conserved nuclear localization signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>, ovarian and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, HSV1716Ing4 was significantly more efficacious than HSV1716 with at least 1000-fold more infectious virus found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> after HSV1716Ing4 treatment compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from HSV1716 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type 1 (HSV-1) PCR, virus DNA was only detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and was not detected in the DNA extracted from any organs of the injected mice demonstrating that, like HSV1716, HSV1716Ing4 replication is exclusively restricted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the potential for enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> destruction by oncolytic HSV expressing Ing4 merits clinical investigation </plain></SENT>
