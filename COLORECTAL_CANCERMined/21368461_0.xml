<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 160 surgical patients (stage II to IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OPRT, TP, and DPD expressions, assessed with immunohistochemistry, were evaluated in relation to clinicopathological features and patient survival </plain></SENT>
