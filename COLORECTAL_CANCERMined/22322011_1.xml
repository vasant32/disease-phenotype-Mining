<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been considerable interest in understanding the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> that bind the lectin Helix pomatia agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> as the lectin has been shown to identify glycosylation changes associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> has previously been shown to recognize aberrant O-linked α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28800">N-acetylgalactosamine</z:chebi> (GalNAcα)/mucin glycosylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, including exposed Tn <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent glycan-array analysis reported that diverse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> are also recognized by the lectin, e.g. consortium for functional glycomics (CFG) data: GalNAcα1,3Gal; β-GalNAc; GlcNAcβ1,4Gal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intriguing observations from the CFG array led to this study, in which <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were localized and characterized in an in vitro model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> binding correlated with levels of integrin α6, transcription factors <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nuclear ribonuclear protein (HnRNP) H1, HnRNP D-like, HnRNP A2/B1 as well as heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), glial fibrillary acidic protein and enolase 1 (ENO1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> were non-detectable in the non-metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recognition of HnRNPs, Hsp27 and ENO1 by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> correlated with O-GlcNAcylation of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Integrin α6 was the most abundant <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells with a metastatic phenotype; this concurred with previous findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report in which <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> has been shown to bind O-GlcNAcylated transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This class of proteins represents a new means by which <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> differentiates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells with an aggressive metastatic phenotype </plain></SENT>
