<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although noninvasive stool-based screening tests are used for the early detection of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, concerns have been raised about their sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A metabolomics-based approach provides a potential noninvasive strategy to identify biomarkers of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> including premalignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our primary objective was to determine whether a distinct metabolic profile could be found in both feces and plasma during experimental colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Feces, plasma as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa were obtained from A/J mice at several time points following administration of azoxymethane or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy were used to quantify metabolites in each of these matrices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> was associated with significant metabolic alterations in both the feces and plasma, some of which overlap with metabolic changes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These consisted of 33 shared changes between feces and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, 14 shared changes between plasma and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and 3 shared changes across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 matrices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15611">sarcosine</z:chebi> were found in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and feces whereas increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="11596">2-hydroxyglutarate</z:chebi> were found in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results provide evidence that metabolomics can be used to detect changes in feces and plasma during azoxymethane-induced colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and thus provide a strong rationale for future studies in humans </plain></SENT>
