<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is well known to differ in different geographical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>K-ras mutations have been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and they were extensively studied in developed countries; however, such studies are scarce from developing countries, like Iraq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the frequency and spectrum of K-ras mutations among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Iraqi patients, and their clinico-pathological associations, if any </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive surgically resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The evaluation included screening for ten K-ras mutations in codon 12 and 13 by mutant enriched polymerase chain reaction followed by reverse hybridization to oligospecific probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 50 enrolled patients, 24 (48%) had K-ras mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 mutations were identified in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the latter 24 patients (20/24 tumors had single mutations, 3/24 had double mutations and 1/24 had triple mutations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequently encountered mutations were the G&gt;T transversions and G&gt;A transitions (41.4% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Codon 12 mutations constituted 89.7%, while codon 13 the remaining 10.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent mutation was GGT&gt;<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e> (Gly&gt;Val) of codon 12 documented in 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant clinico-pathological correlations with K-ras mutational status were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The K-ras mutations are frequently encountered among Iraqi <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, with relative higher frequencies of G&gt;T transversions and Gly&gt;Val codon 12 substitutions than encountered in their counterparts in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The latter is most likely to be related to differences in local carcinogens exposure, an aspect which requires further scrutiny </plain></SENT>
