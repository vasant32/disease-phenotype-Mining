<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relative survival of elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) is generally worse than that of younger patients because of more advanced stage at presentation, comorbidity and reduced use of optimal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective phase II trial of the combination of bevacizumab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> in elderly patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total 41 patients aged more than or equal to 70 years with mCRC, who had not received chemotherapy earlier for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, were enroled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (1000 mg/m twice daily on days 1-14) and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg of body weight on day 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment cycles were repeated every 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 65%, including 13% of patients with a complete response and 53% of patients with a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A further 13% of patients maintained stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 11.5 months and the median overall survival was 21.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the advanced age of participants, the rate of bevacizumab-related and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-related adverse events was consistent with that reported earlier in the general mCRC population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of bevacizumab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> is effective and has a favourable tolerability profile and should be considered as an option for the initial treatment of mCRC in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
