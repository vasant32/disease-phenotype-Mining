<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: Disseminated malignant disease with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> as well as bone marrow involvement was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were demonstrated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient had right lower quadrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> due to a spontaneous psoas intramuscular <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: At the time of admission to our hospital, the patient displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001937'>microangiopathic hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and secondary hyperfibrinolysis with a pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> which improved with fluid resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With immediate chemotherapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, folinic acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX regimen) and cetuximab initiated with the second course, plasmatic coagulation could be stabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi>, fibrinogen, fresh frozen plasma as well as red blood cell and platelet infusions could be stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continuation of chemotherapy was possible on an outpatient basis and the further course was associated with a good quality of life until her near end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient died at home 7 months after initial diagnosis of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> due to progressive disease with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>Disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> with microangiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and secondary hyperfibrinolysis is a rare albeit possible event in disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially when the bone marrow is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the underlying cause is the most important therapeutic measure </plain></SENT>
