<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the prognostic effect of three VEGF-A SNPs, -2578, -460 and 405, as well as the corresponding haplotype combinations, in a unique population of stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS &amp; METHODS: The study included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in Denmark in 2003 (698 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One paraffin-embedded tissue block from each patient was used for DNA extraction and analysis of the three VEGF SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The homozygous genotype VEGF -2578 AA had significant effect on time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.01 [95% CI: 1.13-3.56]; p = 0.02) as well as -460TT (HR = 0.50 [95% CI: 0.29-0.89]; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients harboring the haplotype combinations ACG,CTC and ACG,ACG displayed a significantly shorter time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence in both univariate (HR = 1.87 [95% CI: 1.21-2.89]; p = 0.008) and multivariate analysis (HR = 1.76 [95% CI: 1.09-2.82]; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that the gene polymorphism in VEGF-A holds prognostic information and should be considered as a potential adjunct in identification of high-risk stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
