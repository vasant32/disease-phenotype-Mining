<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) who present to the emergency department (ED) reportedly have poorer prognoses than other referral sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical presentations and outcomes of patients referred to the hospital from the ED and those referred from non-ED facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective medical record review study was conducted from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2008, and comprised patients newly diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> admitted to the hospital from the ED or referred from non-ED sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were admitted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis confirmation, staging, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The staging at diagnosis and 2-year mortality were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five (29.2%) patients comprised the ED group, and another 109 (70.8%) patients comprised the non-ED group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the ED group had significantly longer hospital stays, greater in-hospital mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo>, complications, lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, and more proximal than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0345873" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectosigmoid tumor</z:e> locations compared with patients referred from other sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no statistically significant difference in stage at diagnosis or 2-year mortality rate between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ED played a pivotal role in the clinical and diagnostic evaluations of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emergency department physicians provided timely diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> because the stage at diagnosis and 2-year mortality rate of ED patients were not compromised compared with that of patients referred from non-ED sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Efforts should be made to reduce the numbers of patients with late presentations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complications associated with in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
