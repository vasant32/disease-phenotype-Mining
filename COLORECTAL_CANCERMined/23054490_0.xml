<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to establish the measurement invariance of the FACT-C across different modes of administration to ascertain whether it is valid to pool FACT-C data collected by different modes or to assess each group separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 391 Chinese patients with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was recruited from specialist outpatient clinics between September 2009 and July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the original five-factor model of the FACT-C on data collected by self- and interviewer administrations in single-group analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple-group CFA was then used to compare the factor structure between the two modes of administration using chi-square tests and other goodness-of-fit statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hypothesized five-factor model of FACT-C demonstrated good fit in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Configural invariance and metric invariance were fully supported in multiple-group CFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some item intercepts and their corresponding error variances were not identical between administration groups, suggesting evidence of partial strict factorial invariance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that the five-factor structure of FACT-C was invariant in Chinese patients using both self- and interviewer administrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is appropriate to pool or compare data in the emotional well-being and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> subscale scores collected by both administrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measurement invariance in three items, one from each of the other subscales, may be contaminated by response bias between modes of administration </plain></SENT>
