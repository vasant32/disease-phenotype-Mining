<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN:: Prospective comparison cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND SETTING:: The study sample comprised 25 adult inpatients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> managed surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent stoma site marking before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persons undergoing emergency stoma creation and those requiring reconstruction of stomas were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were recruited by WOC nurses at 6 facilities with outpatient clinics operated by WOC nurses and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> control nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> facilities were located in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Six WOC nurses and 6 infection control nurses collected data including participant demographics, types of surgery, and occurrence of SSIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants were prospectively followed for 30 days following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> occurred in 9 out of 25 study participants (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were reported at a rate of 43.8% (n = 7) and 36% (n = 2) with colon and rectal surgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inferential statistical analysis revealed no association between the likelihood of SSI and the distance between abdominal incision and the newly created intestinal ostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: Based on these findings, we concluded that the distance between the location of stoma and the abdominal midline incision is not a significant risk factor for development of an SSI among postcolorectal surgery patients </plain></SENT>
