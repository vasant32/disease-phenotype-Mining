<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> with regulatory functions as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressors and oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in miRNA regions have been reported to be rare and unlikely to be functionally important, recent evidence suggested that rs11614913 SNP in miR-196a2 was associated with the susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and shortened survival time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between this genetic variant and the risk and/or progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 126 CRC patients and 407 healthy controls was periodically enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from blood specimens, and miR-196a2 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the frequency of CC homozygotes or miR-196a2C allele-containing genotypes (CT and CC) was lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients than in the healthy controls, no significant association between miR-196a2 polymorphism and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the 'C' allele in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was also not significantly lower than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subsequent analysis of the association between this polymorphism and the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, there was still no significant difference in both genotype and allelic frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that miR-196a2 polymorphism is not associated with both an increased risk and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Chinese </plain></SENT>
