<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is widely used to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and to remove <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> to reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the benefits and limitations of cap-fitted colonoscopy compared to conventional colonoscopy in terms of technical performance and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Screening colonoscopies performed from 2009 to 2010 with or without a transparent cap were retrospectively examined to compare the rate of successful intubation, cecal intubation time, and number, size, shape, and location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inclusion criterion was visualization of &gt;95 % of the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 2,301 colonoscopies (1,165 with cap-fitted colonoscopy, 1,136 without the transparent cap) were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedures were performed by four experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subjects' demographic characteristics and technical performances were similar between the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant difference in the technical performance between the two techniques was a shorter cecal intubation time with cap-fitted colonoscopy (5.3 vs. 6.6 min; p = 0.045) by one endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> detected was significantly higher with cap-fitted colonoscopy than without the cap (586 vs. 484, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> detection with cap-fitted endoscopy was significantly higher in the right colon than in the left colon (19 vs. 12 %, respectively; p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cap-fitted colonoscopy did not improve the technical aspects of colonoscopy but significantly increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection, especially in the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It did not increase the detection rate of flat or depressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
