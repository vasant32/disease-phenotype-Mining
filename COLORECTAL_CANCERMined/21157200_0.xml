<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: a total of 32 recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (21 males, 11 females; mean age, 52.8 years) were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a baseline and follow-up FDG PET/CT scans after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 32 patients, 23 patients had follow-up carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: on qualitative analysis of baseline and follow-up FDG PET/CT studies, there were 20 nonresponders and 12 were responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On quantitative analysis, there were 19 nonresponders and 13 were responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In responders, baseline and follow-up mean SUV(max) were 11.8 ± 10.1 and 3.7 ± 4.1, respectively (significant decrease, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among nonresponders, baseline and follow-up mean SUV(max) were 8.1 ± 5.2 and 14.1 ± 9.0, respectively (significant increase, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between response and different factors like age, sex, diagnosis, extent of the lesions, and number of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FDG PET/CT appears to be useful modality in evaluating chemotherapy response and can differentiate responders from nonresponders in recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
