<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Despite being readily available and practical to administer, standardised instruments are not widely used in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerns have been raised about the validity of applying such data to individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the practical difficulties of interpreting standardised HrQoL data for individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A purposive sample of 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was chosen from 210 participants in a prospective HrQoL study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an in-depth interview, individual participants were asked about their experiences and to review the accuracy of their own HrQoL data, collected over preceding months using four different instruments (FACT-C QLQ-C30/CR38 SF12 and EQ-5D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A framework qualitative analysis was used to develop emerging themes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A number of themes emerged from the analysis to explain why disparity arose between the patients' experiences and the questionnaire data in certain situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These included weakly worded items that over emphasised health problems, incongruous items within scales causing unpredictable scores, insufficient levels of response causing insensitivity, and unrecognised reversal of item direction causing contradictory scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exogenous factors such as mood and co-morbidities also influenced HrQoL reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from standardised instruments can be used to measure the HrQoL of individuals in clinical practice, but the instruments used need careful selection and interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Appropriate guidance linked to the themes of this study is provided </plain></SENT>
