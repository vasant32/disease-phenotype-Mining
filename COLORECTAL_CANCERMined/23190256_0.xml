<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to evaluate preoperative nutritional status, body composition and dietary intake related to post-operative complications (POC) and post-operative hospital days (POHD) in elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anthropometry, body composition measured by bioelectric spectroscopy and dietary habits assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire were examined in 100 newly-diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from 30-day POC and POHD were collected from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonparametric and chi-squared tests and logistic regression were used to analyse associations between body and dietary variables and post-operative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients had at least one POC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median POHD was six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Body size and composition measures and short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were no different between patients with and without POC, or between patients with POHD &lt;7 and ≥7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dietary variables were otherwise no different between patients with and without POC, although the median intake of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, the sum of eicosapentaenoic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acids</z:chebi>) was significantly lower in patients with versus without POC (0.7 versus 1.2 g day(-1) , P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that preoperative body size, body composition and short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were not related to 30-day post-operative outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high content of marine n-3 PUFA in preoperative habitual diets may protect against POC after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
