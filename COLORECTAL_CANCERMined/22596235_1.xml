<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 19 mCRC patients were treated with FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and bevacizumab followed by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and FDG-PET/CT were performed before treatment and after cycle 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET results were quantified by calculating maximum standardised uptake value (SUV(max)) whereas area under the enhancement curve (AUC), initial AUC (iAUC) and the endothelial transfer constant (K(trans)) were used to quantify DCE-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological analysis of the resection specimen was performed, including measurement of microvessel density (MVD) and proliferation index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both AUC and iAUC were significantly decreased following bevacizumab therapy (median change of 22% (P=0.002) and 40% (P=0.001) for AUC and iAUC, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival benefit was shown for patients with &gt;40% reduction in K(trans) (P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the group of radiological responders, the median baseline SUV(max) was 3.77 (IQR: 2.88-5.60) compared with 7.20 (IQR: 4.67-8.73) in nonresponders (P=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A higher follow-up SUV(max) was correlated with worse PFS (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median MVD was 10.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with an MVD greater than 10, compared with patients with lower MVD (10 months compared with 16 months, P=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High relative decrease in K(trans), low follow-up SUV(max) and low MVD are favourable prognostic factors for mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab before surgery </plain></SENT>
