<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential causes include adrenal, foetal, or ovarian pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common causes during pregnancy are pregnancy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024167" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">luteoma</z:e> and hyperreactio luteinalis </plain></SENT>
