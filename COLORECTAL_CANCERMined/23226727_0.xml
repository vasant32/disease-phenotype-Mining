<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared KRAS point mutations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue and blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed KRAS mutations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues by PCR direct sequencing and in blood samples by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> clamp PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS point mutations were detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> tissue samples of 13 patients (31.0%) and in peripheral blood samples of 10 patients (23.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KRAS point mutations were detected in both samples for 8 patients (19.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting KRAS mutations in peripheral blood and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue samples were 61.5, 93.1 and 83.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive and negative predictive values were 80.0 and 84.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients with mutant KRAS in their plasma preoperatively, did not exhibit KRAS mutations postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our method detected KRAS point mutations in peripheral blood samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, which contained extremely small amounts of mutant cells </plain></SENT>
