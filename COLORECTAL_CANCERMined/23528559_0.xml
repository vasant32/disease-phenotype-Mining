<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high fidelity of eukaryotic DNA replication is due to a combination of accurate incorporation of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> into the nascent DNA strand by DNA polymerases, the recognition and removal of mispaired <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> (proof-reading) by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerases δ and ε, and post-replication surveillance and repair of newly synthesized DNA by the mismatch repair (MMR) apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the contribution of defective MMR to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is well recognized, evidence that faulty DNA polymerase activity is important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development has been limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that germline POLE and POLD1 exonuclease domain mutations (EDMs) predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and, in the latter case, to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> (EC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Somatic POLE mutations also occur in 5-10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and underlie a hypermutator, microsatellite-stable molecular phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> ECs might also acquire somatic POLE and/or POLD1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we have found that missense POLE EDMs with good evidence of pathogenic effects are present in 7% of a set of 173 endometrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, although POLD1 EDMs are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The POLE mutations localized to highly conserved residues and were strongly predicted to affect proof-reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, POLE-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were hypermutated, with a high frequency of base substitutions, and an especially large relative excess of G:C&gt;T:A transversions </plain></SENT>
