<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is known that many individuals worry about their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> recurring after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treatment but the significance and specific manifestations of this problem require exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This paper reports upon the research findings of a qualitative study to explain how fears of recurrence can affect individuals recovering from curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A longitudinal, grounded theory study was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen participants who had received curative treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were interviewed on up to four occasions during the 12 months following their surgery, 62 interviews were conducted in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Many participants expressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> about if and when their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> might return, despite the knowledge that they had had successful treatment for early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This fear led some to adopt new behaviours in a desire to achieve a more dependable and controllable body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heightened monitoring and management of the body characterised a state of 'guarding' - a concept developed from the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, other participants did not perceive the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> to be as personally threatening or were able to assume strategies to manage any such concerns and find a sense of resolution to their recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The nature of an individual's response to fears of recurrence and consequent impact on their recovery warrants greater clinical consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Providing opportunities to openly discuss the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e>, assessing individual fears and offering suggestions on possible coping strategies to lessen the associated distress, are essential supportive activities enabling transition to life beyond <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
