<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signaling transductions mediated by the binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to its receptor KDR (kinase insert domain receptor) is the most important pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF have been extensively implicated in the etiology and treatment outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no study has been reported evaluating the role of KDR SNPs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We herein assessed the association between four potentially functional KDR SNPs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence in a Chinese population with 408 surgically resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most significant SNP was for rs10013228 located in the KDR gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype, the variant-containing genotypes of this SNP were significantly associated with a reduced recurrence risk with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-0.95, P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a borderline significant association was noted for another promoter SNP, rs2071559, with an HR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.42-1.07, P = 0.092) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In stratified analysis, the associations of both SNPs were more prominent in patients receiving chemotherapy (HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.94, P = 0.033 for rs10013228 and HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95, P = 0.032 for rs2071559) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed a protective effect on patient recurrence by chemotherapy (HR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-1.01, P = 0.046), which was more evident in patients with the variant-containing genotypes of each of the two SNPs (HR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.55, P = 0.009 for rs10013228 and HR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.18-0.86, P = 0.020 for rs2071559) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our findings suggest SNPs in the KDR gene modulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence, especially in those receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
