<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The start of chemotherapy usually requires a delay of about 4 weeks after surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is no evidence for the required length of this delay interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is a chance that a patient may die because postoperative chemotherapy was not started soon enough and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e> was able to develop rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of an early start of chemotherapy after the resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They received XELOX therapy (130 mg/m2 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> on day 1 plus 1,000 mg/m2 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> twice daily on days 1 to 14) on the 7th postoperative day and XELOX + bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg of bevacizumab on day 1) after the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients underwent open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The procedures included right hemicolectomy in 1 patient, sigmoidectomy in 2 patients, high anterior resection in 1 patient, and Hartmann procedure in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients started chemotherapy on postoperative day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median number of cycles of chemotherapy was 11 (8 to 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No postoperative complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reduction rate was 44.3% (32.0 to 66.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival was 10.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An early start of chemotherapy after surgery is feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest possible changes in the start time of chemotherapy after surgery in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We have already started a new phase II trial to confirm the effects of the early start of chemotherapy after surgery </plain></SENT>
