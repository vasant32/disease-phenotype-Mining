<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Selection of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch Syndrome</z:e> (LS) for a genetic study involves the application of clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To increase the rate of identification of mutations, the use of molecular studies as Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To demonstrate the usefulness of MSI and IHC in the detection of mutations in patients with LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: From our Familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Registry, families suspected of LS were selected according to Amsterdam or Bethesda clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening of germline mutations of MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 genes was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis of MSI and IHC were performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 35 families were studied (19 met Amsterdam and 16 met Bethesda criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty one families harbored a germline alteration in MLH1, MSH2 or MSH6 (18 Amsterdam and 3 Bethesda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these families, eighteen different alterations were found, 15 of which were mutations and 3 corresponded to variants of uncertain pathogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 80% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed positive microsatellite instability (27 MSI-high and 1 MSI-low), and immunohistochemical testing showed that 77% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had the loss of a protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlation between results of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> molecular studies and the finding of germline nucleotide change showed that IHC and MSI predicted mutations in 81 and 100% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MSI and IHC can efficiently select patients with a high probability of carrying a mutation in DNA repair genes </plain></SENT>
