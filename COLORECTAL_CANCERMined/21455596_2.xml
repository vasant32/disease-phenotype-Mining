<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lymph node ratio (LNR) has been reported to represent a powerful independent prognostic value in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of LNR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is still under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 505 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using running log-rank statistics, we calculated the best cutoff values for LNRs and proposed a novel rN category: rN1, 0% &lt; LNR ≤ 35%; rN2, 35% &lt; LNR ≤ 69%; and rN3, LNR &gt; 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Spearman's correlation coefficient test was used to assess the correlation between the number of retrieved nodes and the number of metastatic nodes, as well as the number of retrieved nodes and the LNRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and two-step multivariate analyses were performed, respectively, to identify the significant prognostic clinicopathologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate decreased significantly with increasing LNRs: rN(1) = 61% survival rate, rN(2) = 30.3% survival rate, and rN(3) = 11.2% survival rate (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and two-step multivariate analyses identified the rN category as a significant prognostic factor no matter whether the minimum number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> retrieved was met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant prognostic difference among different rN categories for any pN category, but no apparent prognostic difference was seen between different pN categories in any rN category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> could be seen within III(a-c) substages when survival was compared among rN(1-3) categories but not between pN(1-2) categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: rN categories have more potential for predicting patient outcomes and are superior to the UICC/AJCC pN categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend rN categories for prognostic assessment and rN categories should be reported routinely in histopathological reports </plain></SENT>
