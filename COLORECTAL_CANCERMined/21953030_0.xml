<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that levels of alpha-2-heremans-schmid-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (AHSG), complement component C3 (C3), clusterin (CLI), haptoglobin (HP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) are significantly altered in serum from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the abundance levels for these proteins in serum samples from patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> compared to healthy controls (age and gender matched) using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression (LR) models were fitted to the resulting data, and the classification ability of the proteins was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic curve and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most accurate individual candidate biomarkers were C3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.89, LOOCV = 73%], CLI for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (AUC = 0.98, LOOCV = 90%), HP for small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> (AUC = 0.97, LOOCV = 88%), C3 for <z:mp ids='MP_0002027'>lung adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AUC = 0.94, LOOCV = 89%) and HP for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the lung (AUC = 0.94, LOOCV = 87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best dual combination of biomarkers using LR analysis were found to be AHSG + C3 (AUC = 0.91, LOOCV = 83%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, CLI + HP (AUC = 0.98, LOOCV = 92%) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, C3 + SAA (AUC = 0.97, LOOCV = 91%) for small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> and HP + SAA for both <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AUC = 0.98, LOOCV = 96%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the lung (AUC = 0.98, LOOCV = 84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high AUC values reported here indicated that these candidate biomarkers have the potential to discriminate accurately between control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> groups both individually and in combination with other proteins </plain></SENT>
