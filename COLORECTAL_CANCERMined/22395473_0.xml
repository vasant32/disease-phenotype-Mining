<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basis of the disease is believed to be the mismatch repair gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic screening has been performed among the patients who have undergone surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> at the University of Debrecen, Department of Surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> samples of the screened patients were submitted to immunohistochemistry on hMLH1, hMSH2 and hMSH6 genes, microsatellite instability testing, followed by sequencing and multiple ligation dependent probe amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three families were identified with the missense mutation c.143A&gt;C (p.Q48P) of hMLH1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one of the families a segregation analysis of this particular variant was also accomplished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The segregation analysis revealed a clear correlation between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cases and the occurrence of this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, none of the analyzed 100 healthy controls demonstrated the same aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is only one published evidence in the literature about the presence of this rare variant in any population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Gln to Pro switch in the ATPase domain, a conservative region of the hMLH1 gene, creates significant changes in the protein structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that this mutation is the abnormality responsible for the patients' phenotype and it is feasible that this particular aberration occurs more frequently among Hungarian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
