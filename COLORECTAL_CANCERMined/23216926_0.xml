<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical and prognostic significance of CD133 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Publications were identified which assessed the clinical or prognostic significance of CD133 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> up to October 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed to clarify the association between CD133 expression and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, and comprised 3652 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these data showed that CD133 was not significantly associated with the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> invasion (odds ratio [OR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-2.68, Z = 1.15, P = 0.252) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.28-1.46, Z = -1.06, P = 0.286) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, there was no statistically significant association of CD133 with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.87-1.54, Z = 1.05, P = 0.315) or lymphatic invasion (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.81-1.43, Z = 0.53, P = 0.594) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in identified studies, overexpression of CD133 was highly correlated with reduced overall survival (relative risk [RR] = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.45-3.17, Z = 3.81, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD133 may play an important role in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and overexpression of CD133 is closely related with poorer patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If these findings are confirmed by well-designed prospective studies, CD133 may be a useful maker for clinical applications </plain></SENT>
