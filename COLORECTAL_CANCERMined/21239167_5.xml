<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although molecular markers have been suggested for follow up of treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, their complete clinical application is still under evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the association of immune-related genes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis and survival, a total of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 614 German patients within the Kiel cohort (POPGEN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A promoter variant (rs1800872) in the Interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene was associated with an increased lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> involvement [odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-4.2, for carriers of the TT genotype] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More importantly, among 582 followed up patients the SNP rs3775291 in the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) gene was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specific survival (150 events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients carrying the TT genotype had a 93% increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with the CC carriers [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.93, 95% CI 1.14-3.28] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed effect of the TLR-3 variant was restricted to stage II patients (HR = 4.14, 95% CI 1.24-13.84) and to patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy (HR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results may provide additional candidates for risk assessment in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients for treatment decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further validation of the presented findings is warranted </plain></SENT>
