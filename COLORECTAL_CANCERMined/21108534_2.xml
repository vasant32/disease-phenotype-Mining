<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate total costs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC)-related costs and assess primary cost drivers of treating newly diagnosed mCRC patients after the introduction of biologic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a large national claims database, costs of mCRC patients were estimated in 2004-2009 by examining (1) the cost difference between mCRC patient and their matched non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cohorts, and (2) mCRC-related costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Costs were further assessed by phase of disease (diagnostic, treatment, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survival analysis technique was used to estimate cost of handling variable length of follow-up and data censoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6,746 mCRC patients met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eligibility criteria, 6,675 of them were matched to patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the three phases of disease, the treatment phase was the longest (16.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with matched patients with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, total monthly costs were $14,585 higher for mCRC patients, which was driven by higher inpatient ($7,546) and outpatient ($6,749) care (p &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the study period, cost share of biologics increased from 4.8% among patients diagnosed in 2004 to 9.4% for those diagnosed in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The costs associated with treating mCRC are substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inpatient and outpatient care remain key cost drivers in the medical management of mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cost chare of biologics was low, but increased between 2004 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study sample only included patients with commercial and Medicare supplemental insurance in the US thus may not be generalizable to patients with other insurance or in other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Indirect costs associated with mCRC were not examined </plain></SENT>
