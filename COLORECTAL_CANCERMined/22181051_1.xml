<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify toxicities associated with bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab and estimate the direct costs of these toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were identified by a comprehensive literature search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inpatient costs were estimated using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes and 2007 Medicare payments from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database; costs were converted to 2010 dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outpatient costs were estimated by applying 2010 Medicare reimbursement rates to resource use assumptions (based on in-depth clinical interviews) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Toxicities associated with bevacizumab included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, gastrointestinal (GI) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, and wound-healing complications; toxicities associated with cetuximab and panitumumab included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo>, and infusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inpatient cost per event was highest for GI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (USD 32,443), followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (USD 29,062), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (USD 20,346), and wound-healing complications (USD 13,240), while inpatient costs per event for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> were among the lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cost per event of toxicities treated in the outpatient setting included USD 185 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> up to USD 585 for wound-healing complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LimitATIONS: Treatment costs of toxicities for the outpatient setting were determined using assumptions validated by clinicians, and unit costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates, which are often lower than the reimbursement rates for commercial health insurance plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicities included were only grades 3 and 4 adverse events and might be limited by differences between clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monoclonal antibodies have different toxicity profiles and the costs associated with managing these toxicities vary greatly </plain></SENT>
