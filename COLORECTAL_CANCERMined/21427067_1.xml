<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 2005 to May 2008, patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity were randomized into a double-blind study, to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi> 50 mg 1 h prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> infusion and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi> extended release 37.5 mg b.i.d. from day 2 to day 11 or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxicity was evaluated using numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain intensity and experienced relief under treatment, the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-specific neurotoxicity scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the percentage of patients with a 100% relief under treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included (27 males, median age: 67.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (72.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median number of cycles administered at inclusion was 4.5 (mean cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> dose: 684.6 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty out of 24 patients in arm A (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi>) and 22 out of 24 patients in arm B (placebo) were assessable for neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the NRS, full relief was more frequent in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi> arm: 31.3% versus 5.3% (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">Venlafaxine</z:chebi> side-effects included grade 1-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (43.1%) and asthenia (39.2%) without grade 3-4 events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">Venlafaxine</z:chebi> has clinical activity against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurosensory toxicity </plain></SENT>
