<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the potential of silibinin as a chemopreventive agent in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rat azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> model was used because of its molecular and clinical similarities to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week after AOM injection (post-initiation), Wistar rats received daily intragastric feeding of 300 mg silibinin/kg body weight per day until their sacrifice after 7 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Silibinin-treated rats exhibited a 2-fold reduction in the number of AOM-induced hyperproliferative crypts and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> in the colon compared to AOM-injected control rats receiving the vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Silibinin-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the colon mucosal cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry after propodium <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16382">iodide</z:chebi> staining and by colorimetric measurement of caspase-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms involved in silibinin-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> included the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, inverting the Bcl-2/Bax ratio to &lt;1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This modulation already takes place at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level as shown by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, silibinin treatment significantly (P&lt;0.01) decreased the genetic expression of biomarkers of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> such as IL1β, TNFα and their downstream target MMP7, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them shown to be upregulated during colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The downregulation of MMP7 protein was confirmed by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present findings show the ability of silibinin to shift the disturbed balance between cell renewal and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in rats previously injected with the carcinogen AOM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Silibinin administered via intragastric feeding exhibited potent pro-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and multi-targeted effects at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effective reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_481'>preneoplastic lesions</z:mpath> by silibinin supports its use as a natural agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> chemoprevention </plain></SENT>
