<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This randomized, controlled trial assessed the impact of a tailored navigation intervention versus a standard mailed intervention on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening adherence and screening decision stage (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary care patients (n = 945) were surveyed and randomized to a Tailored Navigation Intervention (TNI) Group (n = 312), Standard Intervention (SI) Group (n = 316), or usual care Control Group (n = 317) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNI Group participants were sent colonoscopy instructions and/or stool blood tests according to reported test preference, and received a navigation call </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SI Group was sent both colonoscopy instructions and stool blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analyses assessed intervention impact on adherence and change in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary outcome, screening adherence (TNI Group: 38%, SI Group: 33%, Control Group: 12%), was higher for intervention recipients than controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively), but the two intervention groups did not differ significantly (P = 0.201) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> change (TNI Group: +45%, SI Group: +37%, and Control Group: +23%) was significantly greater among intervention recipients than controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively), and the intervention group difference approached significance (P = 0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary analyses indicate that tailored navigation boosted preferred test use, and suggest that intervention impact on adherence and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> was attenuated by limited access to screening options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions had significant, positive effects on outcomes compared with usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNI versus SI impact had a modest positive impact on adherence and a pronounced effect on <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Mailed screening tests can boost adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Research is needed to determine how preference, access, and navigation affect screening outcomes </plain></SENT>
