<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both drugs have different toxicity patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers for predicting high-risk severe adverse reactions can help select the best treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 106 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients receiving an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based treatment and 56 receiving an irinotecan-based treatment was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One copy number variant (GSTT1) and nine polymorphisms in irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> metabolism, transport or DNA repair genes (ABCB1, UGT1A1, XRCC1, ERCC1, ERCC2, GSTP1) were genotyped by SNaPshot, polymerase chain reactions' length fragments, or copy number assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In irinotecan-treated patients, C allele of ABCB1 C1236T SNP was associated with a lower risk of asthenia (OR = 0.043; 96 % CI = 0.004-0.444; P = 0.008) and C allele of ABCB1 C3435T SNP was associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (OR = 0.162; 95 % CI = 0.031-0.844; P = 0.031); and individuals with two copies of GSTT1 gene had a lower risk for asthenia (OR = 0.074; 95 % CI = 0.009-0.617; P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-treated patients, carriers of two C variants of Asn118Asn ERCC1 SNP had a lower risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (OR = 0.203; 95 % CI = 0.060-0.683; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These biomarkers could help oncologists select the best treatment by reducing toxicity associated with irinotecan or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, thus increasing their quality of life </plain></SENT>
