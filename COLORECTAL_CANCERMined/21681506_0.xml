<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> following a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopy in the Medicare population is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 5% national sample of Medicare enrollees from 1996 to 2005 was used to identify patients undergoing complete colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A colonoscopy not associated with any procedure (e.g., biopsy, polypectomy or fulguration) was defined as a negative colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 12 months of colonoscopy were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariable model was constructed to evaluate the factors associated with a new diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the period from 12 to 120 months following the negative colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 200,857 patients (mean age 74 years, 61% female, 92% White) with a negative colonoscopy, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 1.8 per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate for matched follow-up periods decreased from 2.0/1,000 person-years for patients undergoing colonoscopy during 1996-2000 to 1.2/1,000 person years during 2001-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed a significant regional variation in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> following a negative colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence was higher in patients &gt;85 years, males and patients who underwent a negative colonoscopy by a non-gastroenterologist or endoscopist in the lowest volume quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On stratified analyses, endoscopist volume was a significant predictor for non-gastroenterologists only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The specialty and experience of the endoscopist are significant predictors of the incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Medicare patients with a negative colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
