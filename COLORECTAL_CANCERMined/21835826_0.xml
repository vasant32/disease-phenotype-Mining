<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a 72-year-old woman with locally advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> mimicking primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> at the age of 65 years and was initially treated with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation as a treatment for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One year later, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040136" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid tumor</z:e> was detected in her right thyroid lobe and was confirmed to have metastasized from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> based on pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suspected that she had metachronous double <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and treated her with conventional chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, new life-threatening multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We treated her with the drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> because additional genetic analysis against primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> revealed typical double-activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological review by immunostaining concluded that the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> was composed of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, genetic analysis revealed that the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> contained nearly the same types of double-activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations as were present in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a case of <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with double-activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations </plain></SENT>
