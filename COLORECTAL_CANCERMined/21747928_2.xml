<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Then, we sought to investigate the ability of neuropilin-2 to orchestrate epithelial-mesenchymal transition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using specific siRNA to target neuropilin-2 expression, or gene transfer, we first observed that neuropilin-2 expression endows HT29 and Colo320 for xenograft formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, neuropilin-2 conferred a fibroblastic-like shape to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, suggesting an involvement of neuropilin-2 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the presence of neuropilin-2 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines was correlated with loss of epithelial markers such as cytokeratin-20 and E-cadherin and with acquisition of mesenchymal molecules such as vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we showed by surface plasmon resonance experiments that neuropilin-2 is a receptor for transforming-growth factor-β1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of neuropilin-2 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines was indeed shown to promote transforming-growth factor-β1 signaling, leading to a constitutive phosphorylation of the Smad2/3 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with specific TGFβ-type1 receptor kinase inhibitors restored E-cadherin levels and inhibited in part neuropilin-2-induced vimentin expression, suggesting that neuropilin-2 cooperates with TGFβ-type1 receptor to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a direct role of NRP2 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and highlight a cross-talk between neuropilin-2 and TGF-β1 signaling to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that neuropilin-2 fulfills <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the criteria of a therapeutic target to disrupt multiple oncogenic functions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
