<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) to profile the serum metabolome in patients with mCRC and determine whether a disease signature may exist that is strong enough to predict overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 153 patients with mCRC and 139 healthy subjects from three Danish hospitals, we profiled two independent sets of serum samples in a prospective phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the training set, (1)H-NMR metabolomic profiling could discriminate patients with mCRC from healthy subjects with a cross-validated accuracy of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the validation set, 96.7% of subjects were correctly classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients from the training set with maximally divergent OS were chosen to construct an OS predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After validation, patients predicted to have short OS had significantly reduced survival (HR, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.06-5.50; P = 1.33 Ã— 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A number of metabolites concurred with the (1)H-NMR fingerprint of mCRC, offering insights into mCRC metabolic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings establish that (1)H-NMR profiling of patient serum can provide a strong metabolomic signature of mCRC and that analysis of this signature may offer an independent tool to predict OS </plain></SENT>
