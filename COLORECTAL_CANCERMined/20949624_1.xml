<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, higher levels of BMD have been inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, particularly in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no prior studies have examined the potential association between BMD and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, which are precursor lesions to most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the association between BMD, which was measured using a whole body, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in 167 patients who underwent colonoscopy screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that patients in the highest tertile of total body BMD (&gt;1.294 g/cm(2)) and in the middle tertile (≥1.167 to ≤1.294 g/cm(2)) compared to those with a total body BMD in the lowest tertile (&lt;1.167 g/cm(2)) had a lower risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (highest vs. lowest tertile: OR = 0.29 (0.10-0.84); middle vs. lowest tertile: OR=0.26 (0.08-0.80); p-trend=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratification by gender revealed that this association was more pronounced in women (highest (&gt;1.280 g/cm(2)) vs. lowest (&lt;1.130 g/cm(2)) tertile: OR=0.08 (0.01-0.70); middle (≥1.130 to ≤1.280 g/cm(2)) vs. lowest tertile: OR=0.15 (0.04-0.94); p-trend=0.02) even after excluding hormone replacement therapy users (highest (&gt;1.295 g/cm(2)) and middle (≥1.132 to ≤1.295 g/cm(2)) vs. lowest (&lt;1.132 g/cm(2)) tertile: OR=0.17 (0.03-0.97); p-trend=0.04) </plain></SENT>
