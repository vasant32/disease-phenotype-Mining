<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess primary care patients for their awareness, knowledge, and attitude towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and screening, to report on the uptake of faecal occult blood test screening and the results of screening, and explore predictors of screening uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four primary care clinics in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 1664 patients aged 50 to 74 years attending the clinics in the period July 2006 to July 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Percentage of subjects who were aware that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is common and curable at an early stage, and who knew that faecal occult blood test or colonoscopy is useful for screening; relevant knowledge score; uptake rate of faecal occult blood testing; rate of testing positive; and factors predicting uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 1645 questionnaires were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 89% (95% confidence interval, 88-91%) were aware that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is common, 95% (94-96%) believed faecal occult blood test and colonoscopy are useful for screening, and 58% (56-61%) achieved a knowledge score of 50% or above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The uptake rate of the faecal occult blood test was 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Uptake was higher among those with a positive family history (odds ratio=1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.27; P=0.02), those who were more aware that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is common (1.86; 1.29-2.69; P=0.001), and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is potentially curable at an early stage (1.76; 1.32-2.36; P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rate of testing positive was 2.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.3%); no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was detected and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> detection rate (for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>) was 5.1 per 1000 subjects screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients were aware that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is common in our community, and faecal occult blood test or colonoscopy is useful for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The uptake of screening was low, though relatively higher for those with a positive family history and greater awareness of the high frequency and potential for cure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Faecal occult blood test positivity rate was 2.1%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> detection rate 5.1 per 1000 screened </plain></SENT>
