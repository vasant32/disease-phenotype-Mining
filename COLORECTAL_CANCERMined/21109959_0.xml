<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 78 patients with stage II/Dukes' B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first group consisted of 18 patients who had developed recurrence/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (recurrence group) and the other one of 60 patients who had survived without recurrence (non-recurrence group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="43" ids="29811">ONCs</z:chebi> was compared between the two groups with respect to i) single cells (≥3 floating <z:chebi fb="43" ids="29811">ONCs</z:chebi>), ii) clusters of cells (≥1 floating aggregates of 2-20 ONCs), and iii) single cells + clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When single cells were detected, the sensitivity for recurrence was 55.6% (10/18), the positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) was 30.3% (10/33), the specificity was 61.7% (37/60, p=0.195), and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 82.2%(37/45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the clusters, the sensitivity was 55.6% (10/18), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> was 37% (10/27), specificity was 71.7% (43/60, p=0.033), and NPV was 84.3% (43/51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With single cells + clusters, the values were 55.6% (10/18), 43.5% (10/23), 78.3% (47/60, p=0.006), and 85.5% (47/55), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the detection of single cells + clusters has a high specificity and NPV, and indicates a low risk of recurrence/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage II colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
