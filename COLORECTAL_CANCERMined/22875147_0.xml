<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of deleterious effects of low-frequency dominant and independently acting variants may be a partial explanation for such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to type a selection of rare and low-frequency variants (&lt;5%) to elucidate their role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1181 subjects were included (866 controls; 315 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases comprised UK (n=184) and French (n=131) patients with MAP (n=187) or early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n=128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy variants in 17 genes were examined in cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of the variant effect on protein function was investigated in silico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of the 70 variants typed, 36 (51%) were tested for association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one variants were rare (minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt;1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four rare variants were found to have a significantly higher MAF in cases (EXO1-12, MLH1-1, CTNNB1-1 and BRCA2-37, P&lt;0.05) than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pooling <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rare variants with a MAF &lt;0.5% showed an excess risk in cases (odds ratio=3.2; 95% confidence interval=1.1-9.5; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rare variants are important risk factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and, as such, should be systematically assayed alongside common variation in the search for the genetic basis of complex diseases </plain></SENT>
