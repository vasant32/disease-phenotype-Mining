<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> related factors, however, have not been extensively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: : This study aimed to measure the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage on postoperative surgical site and extra surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> after elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: : This was a retrospective matched-cohort analysis of prospectively gathered data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: : The study was conducted in a tertiary referral center and a private hospital specializing in colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: : Between 2004 and 2011, 740 consecutive patients underwent elective resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 2 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing resection for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (group A, â‰¥stage IIB, n = 177) were matched to randomly selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> (group L, &lt;stage IIB, n = 354) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Matching variables were age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, and surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: : We compared 30-day infectious complications rates between patients with advanced (group A) and localized (group L) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Group A had a higher overall rate of IC (44.6 vs 25.4 %, p &lt; 0.001), with a higher risk of infectious complications at both the resection site (p &lt; 0.001) and distant to the resection site (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for infectious complications were advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (OR = 2.70; p &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (OR = 1.89; p = 0.018), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> (OR = 2.22; p = 0.008), and open rather than laparoscopic procedure (OR = 5.11; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: : This study is limited by its retrospective methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: : Advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> increase the risk of infectious complications after colorectal resection, with other risk factors including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and resection by laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Optimization of modifiable risk factors through nutritional repletion and the choice of a minimally invasive operation should be considered </plain></SENT>
