<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> hyaluronate (SH) solution, which is effective in forming and maintaining a mucosal lift and is innocuous to mucosal tissue, is considered a useful injection solution for endoscopic submucosal dissection, a procedure associated with a high risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess the usefulness of this solution in EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> of ≤20 mm in diameter were enrolled for this study and randomized to a SH solution group (0.2% two-fold diluted MucoUp) or to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline group (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ease of EMR was primarily assessed based on ease of submucosal injection, ease of snaring and injection time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SH solution was superior to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline for ease of submucosal injection (57 ± 0.7 vs 50 ± 0.7; P &lt; 0.05), and it showed better results for ease of snaring with less variability (63 ± 0.8 vs 51 ± 1.0; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean injection time was similar between the two groups (3.0 ± 9.0 s and 3.0 ± 2.7 s, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-procedural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in 7% patients (3/46) injected with SH solution and in 6% of patients (3/48) in the control group; there was no significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of two-fold diluted MucoUp facilitated colorectal EMR </plain></SENT>
