<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we examined the colon transit time (CTT) according to the physical activity level (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e>) in Korean adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study subjects were 49 adults: 24 males and 25 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects used an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days to measure the 1-week <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects took a capsule containing 20 radio-opaque markers for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the fourth day, a supine abdominal radiography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the total activity count of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects, the upper 25%, middle 50% and lower 25% were classified into the high (H), moderate (M) and low (L) physical activity (PA) groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total CTT was significantly longer in the female (25.8 hours) than in the male subjects (7.4 hours) (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In regard to difference on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e>, although there was no significant difference among the male subjects, the right CTT in the female subjects was significantly shorter in H group than in M group (P = 0.048), and the recto-sigmoid CTT was significantly shorter in H group than in L group (P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were significant differences in total CTT between L and M groups (P = 0.022), M and H groups (P = 0.026) and between L and H groups (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The female, but not male, subjects showed that moderate and high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PAL</z:e> assisted colon transit </plain></SENT>
