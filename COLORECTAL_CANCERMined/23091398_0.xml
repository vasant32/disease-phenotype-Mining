<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A current debate exists concerning the appropriate selection of patients for PE, with the most important factor being the absence of extrapelvic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the outcome of patients submitted to exenterative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A review of the clinical charts of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent PE between January 1994 and June 2010 at the Institute National of Cancerolog√≠a in Mexico City was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We selected 59 patients, 53 of whom were females (90%), and six of whom were males (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 50 years (range, 21-77 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 51 patients underwent posterior PE (86%), and eight patients underwent total PE (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality occurred in two cases (3%), and 29 patients developed complications (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 11 patients (19%) experienced local failure with mean disease-free survival time of 10.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 28.3 months, nine patients are still alive without evidence of the disease (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PE should be considered in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> without extrapelvic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PE is accompanied by considerable morbidity (49%) and mortality (3%), but local control is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall survival justifies the use of this procedure in patients with primary or recurrent locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
