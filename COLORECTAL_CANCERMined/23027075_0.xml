<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of KRAS mutation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy including bevacizumab before liver resection is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The KRAS and BRAF status of resected CLM was assessed in prospectively studied patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations were correlated with recurrence-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only patients with remaining vital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells in the resected specimen and those without disease progression were analysed; those with progressive disease did not undergo resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (25 per cent) had a KRAS mutation, but none of the 60 patients had a BRAF mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The radiological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy including bevacizumab, assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumours</z:e>, was partial in 52 patients (87 per cent) and the remaining eight had stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The partial response rate was similar in patients with a KRAS mutation and those with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> gene (12 of 15 versus 40 of 45 patients; P = 0·400) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation had a negative prognostic effect on recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 2·48, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·26 to 4·89; P = 0·009) and overall survival (HR 3·51, 1·30 to 9·45; P = 0·013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provided further evidence for the prognostic importance of KRAS status in terms of recurrence-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy including bevacizumab elicited a response, irrespective of KRAS status, in this selected group of patients with CLM </plain></SENT>
