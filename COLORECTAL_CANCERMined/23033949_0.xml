<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reason for such wide variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy responses remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The field of chemotherapy is currently undergoing a paradigm shift from classical cytotoxic chemotherapy to targeted therapy in order to kill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells more efficiently with fewer side effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present review, we focus on colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, which is one of the most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types worldwide and represents a leading cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The signaling pathways downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are central to the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A considerable achievement during the past years was the development of targeted therapies against EGFR using monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two major pathways mediate signal transduction through EGFR: the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>/RAF/MAPK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/ PTEN/mTOR pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sometimes, predictive biomarkers can provide information on the expected response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> to standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such molecular markers for EGFR-targeted treatment have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, disease progression and resistance towards EGFR-directed drugs frequently develop due to mutations in genes downstream of EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe the mechanisms by which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> gain resistance against EGFR-targeted therapies as well as strategies to bypass mutationinduced resistance in these two signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
