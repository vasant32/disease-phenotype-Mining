<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Combined resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with surgery for synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (LM) still remains controversial because of the possible higher morbidity rate, the necessity of an adequate abdominal approach for both resections and the impact on oncological results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, laparoscopy may be beneficial in terms of operative results and could facilitate this combined procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to assess the benefit of the laparoscopic approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection in patients undergoing simultaneous liver resection for synchronous LM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: From 2006 to 2011, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and resectable synchronous LM, for which the total length of the procedure was suspected to be less than 8 h, underwent colorectal laparoscopic resection combined with open and/or laparoscopic liver surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to identify selection criteria, a comparative analysis was performed between patients with and without major postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-one patients underwent combined surgery with laparoscopic colectomy (n = 31) and proctectomy (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conversion rate was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liver resections included major surgery (n = 10) and minor surgery (n = 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extraction of the colorectal specimen was performed through an incision used for open liver resection, except in seven patients who underwent a total laparoscopic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall and major morbidity rates were 55% and 25%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median (range) hospital stay was 16 (6-40) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regarding patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> characteristics, no independent criteria of major morbidity risk were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that laparoscopic colorectal resection combined with liver resection for synchronous LM was feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, laparoscopy facilitates the surgical abdominal approach for combined colorectal and liver resection </plain></SENT>
