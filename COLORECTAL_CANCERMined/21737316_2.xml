<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> in this population are more aggressive and advanced at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to determine if screening should begin at a younger age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To accomplish this, we analyzed the rates of change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence, and compared the incidence with that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> (CC), which is screened earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Locations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were compared to determine the appropriate screening method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Incidence statistics were obtained from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Query System of the SEER database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from 1987 to 2006 in age groups of 5-year increments from 0 to 4 years old to 85+ years old for incidences of colon, rectal, and overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined data from 2002 to 2006 were queried to determine the locations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and the overall incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and CC at different ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Across age groups 20 to 49, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence was higher in 2006 than in 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most significant increase was from age 40 to 44, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> increased from a low of 10.7 per 100,000 in 1988 to 17.9 per 100,000 in 2006 (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> increased 56% and 94%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>People older than 50 had decreasing incidences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Approximately 30% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in patients aged 35 to 49 occurred proximal to the splenic flexure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> equaled and subsequently surpassed CC in the 40 to 44 age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has occurred in patients ages 40 to 44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients over 50 continued to see a decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Many of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> would be missed with sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Consideration should be given for age-based colonoscopic screening beginning at age 40, an age at which the incidence mirrors other accepted screened <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
