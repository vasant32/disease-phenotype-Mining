<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Presence of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (CTC) in metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is associated with poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phenotyping and genotyping of CTC may permit "real-time" treatment decisions, provided CTCs are available for examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate what is needed to detect CTC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CTCs enumerated in 7.5 mL of blood together with survival from 836 patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> were used to predict the CTC concentration in the 42% of these patients in whom no CTCs were found and to establish the relation of concentration of CTCs with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Influence of different CTC definitions were investigated by automated cell recognition and a flow cytometric assay without an enrichment or permeabilization step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A log-logistic regression of the log of CTC yielded a good fit to the CTC frequency distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extrapolation of the blood volume to 5 L predicted that 99% of patients had at least one CTC before therapy initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival of patients with EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, CD45- nucleated CTCs is reduced by 6.6 months for each 10-fold CTC increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry, the potential three-fold recovery improvement is not sufficient to detect CTC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in 7.5 mL of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, CD45- nucleated CTCs are present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with metastatic breast, prostate, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and their frequency is proportional to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To serve as a liquid biopsy for the majority of patients, a substantial improvement of CTC yield is needed, which can only be achieved by a dramatic increase in sample volume </plain></SENT>
