<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the effect of treatment summaries on survivors' accuracy in reporting details of diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Written surveys were completed by 203 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors and 141 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors diagnosed between 1999 and 2008 at a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center in the Minneapolis, MN, area (78 % response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> completed the survey before and again 17 months after receiving a treatment summary, which was sent to them upon request </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of response at each assessment was compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors showed significant improvement in accuracy on stage of disease, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors showed significant improvement in accuracy on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor status, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> receptor status, receipt of hormone therapy, and receipt of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> after receiving the treatment summary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors and older individuals were more likely than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors or younger individuals to indicate that they used the treatment summary in completing the second survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even for items on which accuracy improved significantly, however, patient knowledge remained incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The provision of treatment summaries can improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors' knowledge of details about their diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CANCER</z:e> SURVIVORS: Treatment summaries can meet the specific goal of increasing patient knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their effectiveness might be greater if presented during a dedicated survivorship health care appointment </plain></SENT>
