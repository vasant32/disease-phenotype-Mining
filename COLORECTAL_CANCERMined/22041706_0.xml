<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CINV can significantly affect a patient's quality of life, leading to poor compliance with further chemotherapy treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, we investigated the incidence of CINV induced by mFOLFOX6 and FOLFIRI in 59 outpatients (32 males and 27 females) with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to evaluate CINV severity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> in the female group receiving FOLFIRI (grade 1: 66.7% and grade 2: 20.0%) was significantly higher than that in the male group (grade 1: 23.1% and grade 2: 7.7%, p=0.0066) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> in the younger (&lt;63 years old) group receiving FOLFIRI (grade 1: 57.1% and grade 2: 28.6%) was significantly higher than that in the older (â‰§63 years old) group (grade 1: 35.7%, p=0.0031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that patients who were female or younger had a significantly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> than patients who were male or older, respectively, when treated with FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that gender (female) and age (younger) are factors predicting poor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> control in outpatients receiving FOLFIRI, but not those treated with mFOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Information on such predictive factors should be useful to promote the effectiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
