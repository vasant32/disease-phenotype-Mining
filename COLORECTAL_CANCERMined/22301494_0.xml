<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>Necrosis</z:mp> in this scenario may represent a lack of treatment effect or a therapeutic response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to validate the histologic classification of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> into 2 types: usual <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (UN) representing an absence of treatment effect, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (ILN) representing a therapeutic response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We incorporated ILN into a modified TRG (mTRG) and compared its performance as a prognostic factor against TRG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A retrospective clinical and histologic review was undertaken of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> partial hepatectomies performed for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> at our center between 2004 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic features were compared between the 2 types of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, including survival stratified by TRG and mTRG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 109 cases were reviewed, with 46 patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ILN was identified in 12 cases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases were associated with perioperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ILN was significantly associated with perioperative treatment with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy, those with ILN had superior disease-free survival compared with those with UN (P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>mTRG1 to 2 scores were associated with significantly better survival compared with mTRG3 to 5 scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, use of TRG did not demonstrate a significant difference in disease-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ILN represents a form of treatment effect and should be distinguished from UN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A modified grading system that incorporates ILN may enhance the prognostic utility of TRG </plain></SENT>
