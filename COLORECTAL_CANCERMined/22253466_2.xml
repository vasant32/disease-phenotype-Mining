<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Clinical trials have shown that adding bevacizumab to cytotoxic chemotherapy improves survival for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, although its effectiveness in the Medicare population is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare linked database, we identified 2,526 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed between 2002 and 2007 who received first-line combination chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine and either irinotecan (33%) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six percent of patients received bevacizumab with first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were bevacizumab-associated toxicities, including the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and GI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the primary cohort inclusive of patients diagnosed between 2002 and 2007, bevacizumab with combination chemotherapy was associated with improved overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.93), although the effect was more modest when restricted to years 2004 to 2007 (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed survival advantage of bevacizumab was more apparent with irinotecan-based chemotherapy (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.97) than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab, versus combination chemotherapy without bevacizumab, was associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (4.9% v 2.5%, respectively; P &lt; .01) and GI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (2.3% v 1.0%, respectively; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were not increased with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of bevacizumab to cytotoxic combination chemotherapy was associated with small improvement in overall survival as well as increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, but not cardiac events, among Medicare beneficiaries with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
