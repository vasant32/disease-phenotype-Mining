<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a quantification method that relies on a standard plot, constructed from known concentrations of standards, in order to measure the number of miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to this, we analyzed the expression levels of miR-21, miR-31, miR-96 and miR-135b in 52 cases of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal tissue using real-time PCR with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51461">SYBR-Green I</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An independent sample t-test was used to compare the differential expression between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Mann-Whitney U and Kruskall-Wallis tests were used to compare the correlation between miRNA expression levels and clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of miR-21, miR-31, miR-96 and miR-135b was upregulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal tissues (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-21 and miR-135b were positively correlated with the clinical stage (P=0.048 and P=0.029, respectively), while miR-96 and miR-135b were correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (P=0.006 and P=0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that miR-21, miR-31, miR-96 and miR-135b may function in the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>miR-135b levels in particular may correlate with the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
