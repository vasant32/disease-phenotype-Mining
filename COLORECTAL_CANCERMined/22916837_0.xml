<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Errors made during this continuous DNA replication are supposed to be corrected by the DNA mismatch repair mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Failure of this mismatch repair mechanism has been described in hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC) and results in a replication error phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inherent to their instability during replication, microsatellites are the best markers of this replication error phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the role of defects in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism and microsatellite instability (MSI) in relation to the most frequent genetic anomaly, translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21), in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined 10 microsatellite loci (BAT25, BAT26, D5S346, D17S250, D2S123, TGFB, BAT40, D18S58, D17S787 and D18S69) for instability in 28 patients with MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were also immunostained for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2, as well as screened for the presence of t(11;18)(q21;q21) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found MSI in 5/28 (18%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, with MSI occurring in both t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive and -negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> displayed high levels of instability, and, remarkably, this was the only case displaying features of a diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> microsatellite unstable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed a loss of MSH6 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that a MMR-defect may be involved in the development of gastric MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and that a defect of MSH6 might be associated with those MSI-driven gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
