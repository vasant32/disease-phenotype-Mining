<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We focused on the risk factors for poor outcome after curative resection of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in UICC stages I and II based on the data of the Germany-wide quality assurance study "colon/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>)." In some countries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients are encouraged to participate in a clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We feel that this approach is too broad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the data of 15,096 patients operated on from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2004, the following factors were analyzed with the Cox regression model: age, comorbidities, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score, gender, localization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (left colon vs. right colon), perioperative complications (yes/no), pT stage, grading (G1/G2 vs. G3/G4), L-status (lymph vessels invasion yes/no), and V-status (venous invasion yes/no) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The probability of a local relapse in stages I and II was 1.5 and 4.6%, respectively, or distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> 4.7 and 10.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only pT stage [hazard ratio (HR) for pT1 = 1, pT2 = 1.821, pT3 = 2.735, and pT4 = 5.881], L-status (HR for L1 = 1.393), age (HR per year = 1.021), as well as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score IV (HR = 4.536) had significant influence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite favorable prognosis and R0 resection, a small percentage of patients will still relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important risk factor comprising the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free survival is the pT stage followed by L-status and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results should be taken into consideration when determining the course for adjuvant chemotherapy, especially if the course includes the recommendation of clinical trial participation for stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients after an R0 resection </plain></SENT>
