<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The success and cost-effectiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> screening depends on achieving and maintaining high screening uptake rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The involvement of GPs in screening has been found to improve patient compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the endorsement of screening by GPs may increase uptake rates amongst non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: A two-armed randomised controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a GP endorsed reminder in improving patient participation in the NHS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme (NHSBCSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up to 30 general practices in the West Midlands with a screening uptake rate of less than 50% will be recruited and patients identified from the patient lists of these practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients will be those aged 60 to 74, who have previously been invited to participate in bowel screening but who have been recorded by the Midlands and North West <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Hub as non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 4,380 people will be randomised in equal numbers to either the intervention (GP letter and duplicate FOBt kit) or control (no additional contact) arms of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure will be the difference in the uptake rate of FOBt screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> between the intervention and control groups at 13 weeks after the GP endorsed reminder and duplicate FOBt kit are sent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome measures will be subgroup analyses of uptake according to gender, age and deprivation quartile, and the validation of methods for collecting GP, NHSBCSP and patient costs associated with the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Qualitative work (30 to 40 semi-structured interviews) will be undertaken with individuals in the intervention arm who return a FOBt kit, to investigate the relative importance of the duplicate FOBt kit, reminder to participate, and GP endorsement of that reminder in contributing to individuals' decisions to participate in screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Implementing feasible, acceptable and cost-effective strategies to improve screening uptake amongst non-responders to invitations to participate is fundamentally important for the success of screening programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If this feasibility study demonstrates a significant increase in uptake of FOBt screening in individuals receiving the intervention, a definitive, appropriately powered future trial will be designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN: ISRCTN86784060 </plain></SENT>
