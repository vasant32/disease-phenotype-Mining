<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In nearly 20% of patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> metastatic lesions are diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, survival of patients with metastatic lesions to the liver and other organs is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional therapy of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is based on the surgical excision of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>THE AIM OF THE STUDY: was to determine the expression of CD134 and CD137 molecules inside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, at the border of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, in the healthy tissue, and peripheral blood, considering patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 39 patients subject to surgical treatment at the Department of General and Gastroenterological Surgery, due to colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD134 and CD137 adhesive molecule levels were determined inside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, at the border of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and in the healthy margins of the surgical incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the authors evaluated the peripheral blood level of the above-mentioned molecules on the day of the surgical procedure, and 10 days, thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean CD134 levels were the highest inside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, significantly decreasing towards the direction of healthy tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average peripheral blood molecule levels were four-fold higher on the day of the surgical procedure, as compared to values obtained on the tenth postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This dependency also concerned the remaining statistical measures.The mean CD137 levels showed no significant difference, regardless their location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors observed significant, peripheral blood, CD137 level differences, considering the day of the surgical procedure and tenth postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean CD137 peripheral blood level was several times higher on the day of the surgical procedure, as compared to the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The determination of the activity of CD134 and CD137 molecules might create opportunities to plan treatment and predict prognosis in case of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Proper immuno-therapeutic management which is based on the expression of the above-mentioned molecules might help determine the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, preventing from their development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In advanced cases treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> might be possible </plain></SENT>
