<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to compare clinical outcomes of mini laparotomy with conventional laparotomy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Between january 2007 and june 2010, 138 patients and 117 patients underwent elective resection using either mini laparotomy or conventional laparotomy respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mini laparotomy involved a colorectal resection performed through a skin incision â‰¤8 cm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological factors, operative procedure and postoperative course were retrospectively analyzed to compare clinical outcomes between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mini laparotomy seems to be an attractive alternative for resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological and histopathological features were similar between both groups, whereas intraoperative blood loss, operative time and harvested lymph-node numbers in conventional laparotomy were significantly greater (p=0.003, p=0.008 and p=0.024, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative relapse, complications and hospitalization were significantly better in the mini laparotomy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison of postoperative complications between convention and mini laparotomy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> was more frequently encountered in conventional group (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the disease-free survival and overall survival in mini laparotomy group were significantly better than control group (p=0.001 and p=0.017, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to conventional laparotomy, mini laparotomy seems a feasible, minimally invasive and attractive alternative in selected patients </plain></SENT>
