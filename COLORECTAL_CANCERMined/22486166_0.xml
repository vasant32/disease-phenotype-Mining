<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Although effective clinical management of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> detected through the National Health Service (NHS) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme (BCSP) is dependent on the quality of pathological diagnosis, there have been few attempts to formally evaluate inter-observer variability in histological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the impact of inter-observer variability on the reported prevalence of prognostic features in a large series of screen-detected colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective series of 1329 screen-detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (2008-10) was identified from computerized records at two histopathology departments participating in the NHS BCSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slides from a sample of 239 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were exchanged between centres for independent review and measurement of inter-observer (kappa) agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant between-centre differences in the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> with high-risk histological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic review demonstrated good reliability with respect to the assessment of adenomatous change (κ = 0.83), excision margin status (κ = 0.74), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (0.61) and invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (κ = 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, there were significant inter-observer differences in the classification of villous lesions (0.18) despite recent efforts to standardize reporting practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  Inter-observer variability in the assessment of screen-detected colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> limits the prognostic value of histological subtyping and highlights the need for clarification of existing diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
