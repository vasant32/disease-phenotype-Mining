<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A major challenge in the assessment of medicines, treatment options, etc., is to establish a framework for the comparison of risks and benefits of many different types and magnitudes, a framework that at the same time allows a clear distinction between the roles played by the statistical analyses of data and by judgements based on personal experience and expertise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how clinical data can be weighted, scored and presented by the use of an eight-step data-driven benefit-risk assessment method, where two genetic profiles are compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to present a comprehensive approach that is simple to apply, allows direct comparison of different types of risks and benefits, quantifies the clinical relevance of data and is tailored for the comparison of different options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analysed a cohort of 302 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were cure rate, survival rate, time-to-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (TTD), time-to-relapse (TTR) and main adverse drug reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multifactor dimensionality reduction (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) was used to identify genetic interaction profiles associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have been able to demonstrate that a specific <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-derived combination (the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 group) of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and thymidylate synthase polymorphisms is associated with increased and clinically significant difference for cure and survival rates, TTD and probably also for TTR, which are seen as the most important endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An inferior profile was observed for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A probably inferior profile was seen for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A clear superior profile was seen for severe mucositis/<z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proposed approach offers comprehensive, data-driven assessment that can facilitate decision processes, for example, in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It employs descriptive statistical methods to highlight the clinically relevant differences between options </plain></SENT>
