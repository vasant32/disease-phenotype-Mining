<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Proteolytic enzymes and their regulators have important biological roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by stimulating invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, which makes these factors attractive as potential prognostic biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) was characterised using immunohistochemistry in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> from a cohort of 277 prospectively recruited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, and associations with expression of S100A4, clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight samples (72%) displayed positive membrane staining of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, whereas 10 cases (4%) were borderline positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EMMPRIN expression was associated with shorter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free, disease-specific and overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognostic impact was largely confined to TNM stage III, and EMMPRIN-negative stage III patients had an excellent prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, EMMPRIN was significantly associated with expression of S100A4, and the combined expression of these biomarkers conferred an even poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no evidence of direct regulation between the two proteins in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines HCT116 and SW620 in siRNA knockdown experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EMMPRIN is a promising prognostic biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and our findings suggest that it could be used in the selection of stage III patients for adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
