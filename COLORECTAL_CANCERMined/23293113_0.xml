<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pyrosequencing is now widely used for the determination of KRAS mutation burden and a conservative cut-off point of 10% has been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up until now, the impact of low-frequency KRAS mutations (&lt;10%) on the response to anti-EGFR Mabs has yet to be evaluated.Patients and methodsTumors from patients receiving anti-EGFR Mabs based on a WT genotype for KRAS, as determined using direct sequencing, have been retrospectively analyzed by pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized as WT (no KRAS mutation) or low-frequency mutation when KRAS mutation was &lt;10% (KRAS low MT).ResultsA total of 168 patients treated by anti-EGFR Mabs for mCRC were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to pyrosequencing, 138 tumors remained KRAS WT, while 30 tumors were KRAS low MT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the KRAS low MT and KRAS WT groups, the response rates were 6.7% and 37.0%, respectively, while stabilization amounted to 23.3% versus 32.6% and progression to 70% versus 29% (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.7 ± 0.5 months for KRAS low MT and was 6.0 ± 0.3 months for KRAS WT (P &lt; 0.01).ConclusionsThese results appear to validate consideration of low-frequency KRAS mutation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> as positive, and justify a large-scale prospective study </plain></SENT>
