<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The fact that the receptors for the TNF-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inducing ligand (TRAIL) are almost invariably expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) represents the rationale for the employment of TRAIL-receptors targeting compounds for the therapy of patients affected by this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, first reports on the use of these bioactive agents provided disappointing results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that loss of membrane-bound TRAIL-R might be a feature of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and that the evaluation of membrane staining rather than that of the overall expression of TRAIL-R might predict the response to TRAIL-R targeting compounds in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM AND METHODS: Thus, we evaluated the immunofluorescence pattern of TRAIL-receptors and E-cadherin to assess the fraction of membrane-bound TRAIL-receptors in 231 selected patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> undergoing surgical treatment only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we investigated whether membrane staining for TRAIL-receptors as well as the presence of KRAS mutations or of microsatellite instability (MSI) had an effect on survival and thus a prognostic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples stained positive for TRAIL-R1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead, membrane staining for these receptors was positive in only 71% and 16% of samples respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation between KRAS mutation status or MSI-phenotype and prognosis could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TRAIL-R1 staining intensity correlated with survival in univariate analysis, but only membranous staining of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 on cell membranes was an independent predictor of survival (cox multivariate analysis: TRAIL-R1: p = 0.019, RR 2.06[1.12-3.77]; TRAIL-R2: p = 0.033, RR 3.63[1.11-11.84]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the current assumptions, loss of membrane staining for TRAIL-receptors is a common feature of early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> which supersedes the prognostic significance of their staining intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Failure to achieve therapeutic effects in recent clinical trials using TRAIL-receptors targeting compounds might be due to insufficient selection of patients bearing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with membrane-bound TRAIL-receptors </plain></SENT>
