<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been some discordant data regarding the value of TIMP-1 as a prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this controversy, we conducted a meta-analysis for the relationship between TIMP-1 levels and overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected the relevant published studies using citation databases including PubMed, Science Citation Index, and Conference Papers Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect sizes of TIMP-1 on the patient's overall survival and TNM stages were calculated by hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect sizes were combined using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survival outcomes between high and low plasma or serum TIMP-1 levels were compared by uni- and multivariate analyses involving 1,477 and 1,359 CRC patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with high plasma or serum TIMP-1 levels showed poor survival rates compared to patients with low plasma or serum TIMP-1 in the uni- and multivariate analyses (HR, 2.2 and 2.1; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, high TIMP-1 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissues was significantly associated with worse survival outcomes in 438 CRC patients (HR = 1.4; P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma or serum TIMP-1 levels predict survival outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
