<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Digital whole-slide scanning of tissue specimens produces large images demanding increasing storing capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To reduce the need of extensive data storage systems image files can be compressed and scaled down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this article is to study the effect of different levels of image compression and scaling on automated image analysis of immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings and automated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> segmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two tissue microarray (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) slides containing 800 samples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> tissue immunostained against Ki-67 protein and two <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> slides containing 144 samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> immunostained against EGFR were digitized with a whole-slide scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> images were JPEG2000 wavelet compressed with four compression ratios: lossless, and 1:12, 1:25 and 1:50 lossy compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each of the compressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> images was furthermore scaled down either to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64 or 1:128 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> images were analyzed using an algorithm that quantitates the extent of staining in Ki-67 immunostained images, and EGFR immunostained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> images were analyzed with an automated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> segmentation algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The automated tools were validated by comparing the results from losslessly compressed and non-scaled images with results from conventional visual assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percentage agreement and kappa statistics were calculated between results from compressed and scaled images and results from lossless and non-scaled images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both of the studied image analysis methods showed good agreement between visual and automated results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the automated IHC quantification, an agreement of over 98% and a kappa value of over 0.96 was observed between losslessly compressed and non-scaled images and combined compression ratios up to 1:50 and scaling down to 1:8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In automated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> segmentation, an agreement of over 97% and a kappa value of over 0.93 was observed between losslessly compressed images and compression ratios up to 1:25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that images stored for assessment of the extent of immunohistochemical staining can be compressed and scaled significantly, and images of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> to be segmented can be compressed without compromising computer-assisted analysis results using studied methods </plain></SENT>
