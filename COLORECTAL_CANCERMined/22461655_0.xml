<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the prevalence of acquired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_68'>diverticulum</z:mpath> of the appendix (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>), including incipient forms and its possible significance as a marker of local/regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pathology database at Hvidovre Hospital was searched for appendix specimens, received between 2001 and 2010, coded for <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> or for a space-occupying lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Slides were reviewed to determine <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> status and the nature of lesions possibly causing <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Among 4413 appendix specimens, <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> were identified in 39 (0.9%, CI 0.6% to 1.2%) cases, 17 (43.6%, 28.0% to 59.2%) of which additionally harboured an appendiceal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>/neoplastic precursor, whereas this figure was 1.2% (CI 0.9% to 1.6%) for non-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> specimens (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of the 39 <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> specimens comprised incipient <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, three of which coexisted with appendiceal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, local/regional non-neoplastic lesions (six cases) and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (four cases) coexisted with <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> has significance as a putative marker of local/regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> specimen proved significantly more likely to harbour a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic growth</z:e> than a non-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Submission for microscopy of the entire <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> specimen, whether transmural or only incipient, and a comment in the pathology report on the occasional concurrence of local/regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in this setting seem appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observation of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> may thus provide a valuable contribution in the diagnostic process </plain></SENT>
