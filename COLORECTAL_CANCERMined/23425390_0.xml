<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Rhabdoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> (RCT) is a rare, highly aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> recurrent in elderly patients, commonly at the caecum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms underlying RCT pathogenesis remain poorly elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis is with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206743" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant rhabdoid tumors</z:e> of infancy characterized by genetic inactivation of SMARCB1 (INI1) or deletions of chromosome 22q12 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods To shed light on RCT pathogenesis, we investigated genetic and epigenetic alterations in two cases of pure and composite RCT and compared them with the profiles of matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis, FISH, methylation specific PCR and DNA sequencing analysis were performed on paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Loss of epithelial markers, (CK20, CDX2 and E-cadherin) and intense vimentin expression was observed in RCTs but neither in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INI1 expression was detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and retained in pure RCT, while it was undetected in composite RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the 22q12 locus was found only in pure RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The APC/a- catenin pathway was not altered, while MLH1 immunostaining was negative in RCTs and positive in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These expression profiles were associated with V600E BRAF mutation, a progressive accumulation of promoter methylation at specific CIMP loci and additional genes from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa to tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Right-sided RCT could be characterized by epigenetic events and molecular features likely similar to those occurring in the serrated pathway and associated with epithelialmesenchymal transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These extremely rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> may benefit from the use of new biological molecules specific for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
