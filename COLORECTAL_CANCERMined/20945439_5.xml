<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blacks have higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> than non-Hispanic whites, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors of this report investigated the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> with excess risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality for blacks in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) that was conducted from 1988 to 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The association between serum 25(OH)D levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality and its contribution to elevated risk among blacks were studied using baseline data from NHANES III and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality data through 2006 from the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using survival models, the adjusted risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for African Americans was examined with and without adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo>, which was defined as an 25(OH)D level &lt;20 ng/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Black race (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04-3.95), age (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.15), not having health insurance (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.12-5.36), and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (HR, 7.22; 95% CI, 2.12-24.6) predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When added to the model, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> was associated significantly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.11-4.00), and the effect of race was decreased (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.87-2.93); the 40% attenuation was statistically significant (F(1) (,49) = 4.85; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed when participants who had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current findings were consistent with the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> contributes to excess African-American mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
