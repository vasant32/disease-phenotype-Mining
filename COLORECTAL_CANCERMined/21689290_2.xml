<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed of 74 patients, â‰¥ 90 years of age, diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during the period 1986-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity, American Society of Anesthesiology (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) grade, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, mortality, morbidity and survival were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 74 patients, 48 (65%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients were classified as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade I-II, 26 as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade III and 26 as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade IV-V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one (42%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (30%) patients were diagnosed during the period 1986-2000 and 52 (70%) were diagnosed between 2001 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-four (59%) patients underwent surgery, of whom 19 (49%) were treated as an emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven (25%) patients died postoperatively, with mortality rates of 12% (3/25) for elective surgery and 42% (8/19) for emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical mortality for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade I and grade II patients was 5% (1/20) and their 5-year survival rate (postoperative mortality excluded) was 44%, whereas 5-year survival for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade III patients who underwent surgery was 12.5% and surgical mortality was 25% (4/16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no survivors beyond 36 months among patients who did not receive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that elective and emergency colorectal surgery can be performed with acceptable rates of mortality and morbidity on nonagenarian patients in good general condition with low perioperative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was related to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade and to the use of surgery </plain></SENT>
