<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although many studies have investigated the prognostic effect of thymidylate synthase (TS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, no consensus has been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this meta-analysis was to obtain a more precise estimate of the prognostic significance of TS expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796563,C1334407" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">localized cancers</z:e> treated by curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHOD: Seventeen eligible studies reporting survival in 2,893 patients stratified by TS expression were pooled using a fixed- or random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was hazard ratio (HR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall HR for overall survival was 1.01 (95% CI 0.74-1.39, p=0.947), with an I2 of 64.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total HR for disease-free survival was 1.36 (95% CI 0.97-1.89, p=0.072), with an I2 of 75.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the TS protein-tested subgroup, the total HR for disease-free survival was 1.72 (95% CI 1.02-2.89, p=0.042), with an I2 of 81.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis showed that, in the adjuvant setting, TS expression does not predict a poorer disease-free survival or a worse overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we believe that it is inappropriate to regard TS expression as a prognostic factor for patients with stage II and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> treated by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
