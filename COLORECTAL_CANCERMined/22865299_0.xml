<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) can be prevented by the early detection and removal of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (AAs) by colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) telomere length as a potential biomarker for the presence of AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PBL telomere length was measured in patients with AAs (n=35), in a control group of similarly aged patients who had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopy (n=145) and in a separate population group with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, again similarly aged (n=495) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere measurements were performed using a quantitative PCR assay and reported as ratios of telomere and single copy gene measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Telomere lengths tended to be lower in patients with AAs than in patients in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopy group (p&lt;0.001) as well as those in the population group (p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A telomere/single copy gene ratio of 0.5 was found to have an estimated 94% sensitivity and a 56% specificity for AAs; a combination of sensitivity and specificity for which a value of &gt;0.5 would reduce the odds of a patient having AAs by a factor of 0.11 (the negative likelihood ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty three percent of individuals in the population group tested above this cutoff and could be considered at low risk for AAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PBL telomeres are shortened in patients with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, suggesting that PBL telomere length could be a promising non-invasive blood biomarker to pre-screen for risk of AAs prior to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
