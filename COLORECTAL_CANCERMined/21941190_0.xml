<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess patient and doctor delay and their determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective observational study in a primary care setting concerning 197 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time between initial symptoms and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of treatment was categorized into four periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With multivariable logistic regression analysis, determinants of delay were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms until the start of treatment was 138 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time for the four periods to: first general practitioner consult, first specialist consult, histological diagnosis, and start treatment were 30, 14, 27, and 18 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rectal blood loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were significantly related to patient delay, whereas psychiatric comorbidity was related to delay in referral by the general practitioner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For delay in histological diagnosis and start of definitive treatment no determinants were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delay was not associated with more advanced disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is considerable delay in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, especially in time to consultation and time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Education among the general public about the importance of alarm symptoms and increasing efficiency of the diagnostic process in hospital setting are a key in improving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> disease management </plain></SENT>
