<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of permanent interstitial brachytherapy with or without supplemental therapies on long-term rectal function using a patient-administered quality-of-life instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred thirty four of the initial 219 prostate brachytherapy patients who remain alive and have participated in a prospective evaluation of rectal function were mailed the rectal function assessment score (R-FAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 134 patients, 3 have a colostomy because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 2 failed to respond, and 129 (99.2% of eligible patients) returned a completed R-FAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R-FAS ranges from 0 to 27 with lower scores indicative of better bowel function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median followup was 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple clinical, treatment, and dosimetric parameters were evaluated for impact on bowel function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the current cohort, R-FAS was 3.35, which was comparable to the 1999 (4.29), 2002 (3.92), and 2006 (4.00) surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 2011 survey, 10 (7.8%), 17 (13.1%), and 102 (78.3%) patients reported bowel function to be worse, improved, or unchanged after brachytherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient has developed a rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of preimplant bowel movements, tobacco, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> correlated with R-FAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the previous thee surveys, patient's perception of overall rectal quality of life was inversely related to the use of supplemental external beam radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term rectal function after prostate brachytherapy is favorable with a small number of patients reporting deterioration in bowel function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The judicious use of supplemental external beam radiation with particular attention to rectal doses may further improve long-term function </plain></SENT>
