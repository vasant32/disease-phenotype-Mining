<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Signatures for BRAF oncogene have been revealed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a previous study we have reported a molecular signature for HRAS and KRAS mutations in colorectal cell lines that also showed an EMT phenotype for HRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we report a molecular profile for a BRAF oncogenic mutation BRAFV600E in colon using the Illumina 45,000 gene microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Key differentially expressed genes have been identified from the array analysis further verified by qPCR analysis </plain></SENT>
