<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have identified myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that are potent suppressors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor immunity</z:e> and therefore a significant impediment to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that MDSCs are generated by malignant diseases or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no systematic studies in patients have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to clinically characterize MDSCs, we tested PBMCs from patients with various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> including cholangiocellular, hepatocellular and pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, esophageal, gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100723'>GIST</z:hpo>, and those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers using flow cytometry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increase was seen in the percentages of MDSCs in PBMCs from patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, MDSC level was higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751075" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the digestive system</z:e> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MDSC level was significantly and inversely correlated to stimulation indices (SI) of PHA-blastogenesis of lymphocytes and serum concentration of total protein, and positively correlated to neutrophil count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MDSC percentage in patients with gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was also significantly correlated to neutrophil count and inversely correlated with lymphocyte count, and showed highly significant correlation to neutrophil/lymphocyte rate (NLR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, MDSC levels in preoperative patients was significantly increased compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and significantly decreased in postoperative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is clear that MDSCs are increased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and closely related to suppression of cell-mediated immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data also suggest that they are related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and that their levels are increased further in the terminal stages of patients whose nutritional status is impaired as observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003075'>hypoproteinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MDSC levels have also been shown to decrease after removal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
