<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Galectin-3 seems to have an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunoexpression of galectin-3 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> under surgery and chemotherapy treatment and the relationship of galectin-3 expression and clinical aspects or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Galectin-3 expression was examined immunohistochemically in 75 samples of colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A scoring system was used to evaluate the cytoplasmic cells color </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the patients, 40 were female; the average age was 61.98 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the site, 42.6% was of the rectum, 33.4% right colon, and 24% left colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were stage II, 32 stage III, and ten stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Galectin-3 immunoexpression was classified as 1 in 57.33% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest percentage of staining cells appeared in the most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> (p = 0.4899) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrence had a great number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with high score (p = 0.0465) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, high or moderate galectin-3 immunoexpression had been associated with an increased marginal risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = 0.0795) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The immunoexpression of galectin-3 was strong or moderate in 42% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with strong or moderate immunoexpression of galectin-3 died or had recurrence more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was marginally reduced in patients with negative or low-grade galectin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Galectin-3 cytoplasmatic immunoexpression seems to be a prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> because a higher risk of recurrence had been observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a high score of galectin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was not found on this group </plain></SENT>
