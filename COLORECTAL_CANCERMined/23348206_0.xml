<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current consensus guidelines recommend that patients with AA undergo more intense postpolypectomy surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these clinical situations, the interobserver reliability in determining VC and HGD would play a major role in the credibility of these consensus guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate interobserver variability of VC and HGD in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> &lt;1 cm before and after the development of consensus criteria among gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five GI pathologists independently evaluated 107 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> &lt;1 cm, and classified them into tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with a VC (A-VC) and into low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then a consensus conference was held and consensus criteria for VC and HGD were developed by group review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same set of 107 slides were rereviewed independently by the same 5 GI pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interobserver variability using κ statistical analysis before and after the application of consensus criteria was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 1-sided z-test was used to determine whether κ scores increased after the consensus conference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement before and after the consensus conference was poor for assessment of A-VC, HGD, and AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data calls into question the validity of basing clinical decisions on this distinction </plain></SENT>
