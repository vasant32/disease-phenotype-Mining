<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role and clinical relevance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to reveal the prognostic significance of BAP1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed quantitative PCR and Western blotting analyses to examine BAP1 expression in 8 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate BAP1 expression in archived 252 paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of BAP1 were down-regulated in 6 out of 8 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues compared with their adjacent non-cancerous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BAP1 expression was closely correlated with age (p = 0.037), clinical stage (p = 0.001), T classification (p &lt; 0.001), N classification (p &lt; 0.001), and pathologic differentiation (p = 0.008) and histological type (p = 0.047) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with lower BAP1 expression survived shorter than those with higher BAP1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, multivariate analysis demonstrated that BAP1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, we provide the first evidence that reduced BAP1 expression is associated with poor prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and BAP1 may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
