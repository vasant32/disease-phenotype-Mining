<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of tight junctions (TJs) is often associated with human diseases including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and recent studies support role of TJ integral proteins in the regulation of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this regard, expression of claudin-1, a key constituent of TJs, is highly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and is causally associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, mechanism/s underlying regulation of claudin-1 expression in intestinal epithelial cells remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our studies, we have identified putative binding sites for intestinal transcription factors Cdx1, -2 and GATA4 in the 5'-flanking region of the claudin-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our further studies using full length and/or deletion mutant constructs in two different human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, SW480 and HCT116, showed key role of Cdx1, Cdx2 and GATA4 in the regulation of claudin-1 mRNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, overexpression of Cdx2 had the most potent effect upon claudin-1 mRNA expression and promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patient samples, we observed a significant and parallel correlation between claudin-1 and Cdx2 expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay confirmed the Cdx2 binding with claudin-1 promoter in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using Cdx2 deletion mutant constructs, we further mapped the Cdx2 C-terminus domain to be important in the regulation of claudin-1 promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, co-expression of activated Î²-catenin further induced the Cdx2-dependent upregulation of claudin-1 promoter activity while expression of the dominant negative (dn)-TCF-4 abrogated this activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we conclude that homeodomain transcription factors Cdx1, Cdx2 and GATA4 regulate claudin-1 gene expression in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a functional crosstalk between Wnt-signaling and transcriptional activation related to caudal-related homeobox (Cdx) proteins and GATA-proteins is demonstrated in the regulation of claudin-1 promoter-activation </plain></SENT>
