<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to measure perception of risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A consecutive sample of overweight adult patients (n = 195) attending to nutritional counseling was submitted to clinical questionnaire addressing personal and family data, awareness about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors, health status, and estimates of their own risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 32% identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> among CCR risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For 57% of participants, their own current BMI status did not confer any increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, for half (46%) of the patients, their BMI status will not lead to an increased risk during lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 36%, an increased risk was accurately estimated as two or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accurate estimates tend to be made by older patients (p = 0.033), those with GI complaints (p = 0.040), or with familial history (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even among patients attending to a nutritional consultation, only a third of patients seem to adequately consider their own overweight as a potential risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Practice implications: health education programs concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> must include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as a potential outcome for overweight patients </plain></SENT>
