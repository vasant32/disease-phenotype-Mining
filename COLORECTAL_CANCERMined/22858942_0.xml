<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, serum of 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> people, 46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and 44 rectum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were measured using Raman spectra and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The information of Raman peaks (intensity and width) and that of the fluorescence background (baseline function coefficients) were selected as parameters for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Principal component regression (PCR) and partial least square regression (PLSR) were used on the selected parameters separately to see the diagnosing performance of the parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR performed better than PLSR in our spectral data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used on the principal components (PCs) of the two regression methods on the selected parameters, and the diagnostic accuracy were 88% and 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is that the selected parameters can maintain the information of the original spectra well and Raman spectroscopy of serum has the potential for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
