<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An appreciable fraction of patients who receive 5-FU suffer severe adverse toxicities, which in extreme cases may result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, encoded by DPYD) rapidly degrades 85% of administered 5-FU, and as such, limits the amount of drug available for conversion into active metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have suggested that genetic variations in DPYD increase the risk for 5-FU toxicity, however, there is not a clear consensus about which variations are relevant predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, DPYD variants were expressed in mammalian cells, and the enzymatic activity of expressed protein was determined relative to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative sensitivity to 5-FU for cells expressing DPYD variations was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DPYD*2A variant (exon 14 deletion caused by IVS14+1G&gt;A) was confirmed to be catalytically inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with WT, two variants, S534N and C29R, showed significantly higher enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cells expressing S534N were more resistant to 5-FU-mediated toxicity compared with cells expressing WT DPYD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that selected DPYD alleles are protective against severe 5-FU toxicity, and, as a consequence, may decrease the effectiveness of 5-FU an antitumor drug in carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, this study shows a method that may be useful for phenotyping other genetic variations in pharmacologically relevant pathways </plain></SENT>
