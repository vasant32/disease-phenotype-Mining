<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ATP-competitive mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) inhibitors are in early phase clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These novel targeted agents, including PP242, are mechanistically distinct from the allosteric, partial mTOR inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate how PP242 best combines with standard chemotherapies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), and which subsets of patients are most likely to benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combination index for PP242 plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, or irinotecan was determined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines with different mutational backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In KRAS mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, sensitivity to PP242 increases with co-mutation of PIK3CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation of p53 predicts resistance to chemotherapy, but not PP242 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of PP242 was comparable to that of standard chemotherapies over the dose range tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity or resistance to PP242 dictates relative synergy or antagonism, respectively, when PP242 is combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same trend exists for PP242 + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, but with a narrower dynamic range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely potency of PP242 and the combination index for PP242 + irinotecan were unrelated, but synergy exists across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose levels in PP242 and irinotecan sensitive, p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, our in vitro analysis predicts that mutational status can be used to rank sensitivity to PP242 and standard chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Single agent potency can in turn be used to predict the combination index in a drug-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a clinical trial to determine whether ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors provide benefit in combination with standard chemotherapies for patients with PIK3CA mutant metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, stratified by the presence or absence of KRAS co-mutation </plain></SENT>
