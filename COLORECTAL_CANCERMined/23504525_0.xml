<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the results of these studies on the association remain inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive search was conducted to identify the eligible studies of ABCB1/MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95Â % confidence interval (CI) for ABCB1/MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with the Stata (Version 12.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen case-control studies, a total of 11,339 persons including 5,485 cases and 5,854 controls, met the included criteria and thus were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that there were no significant associations of ABCB1/MDR1 C3435T polymorphism with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparison models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis, the same results were detected for both Caucasian and Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this meta-analysis suggest that ABCB1/MDR1 C3435T polymorphism might be not related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
