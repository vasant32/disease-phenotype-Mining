<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate totally laparoscopic strategies in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients presenting to Ninewells Hospital between July 2007 and August 2010, with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon and rectum with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent simultaneous laparoscopic liver and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> resection, a staged laparoscopic resection of SCRLM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, or simultaneous colon resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of SCRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were in-hospital morbidity and mortality, total hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss, duration of surgery, and resection margin status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients presented with synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients underwent a simultaneous laparoscopic liver and colon resection (median operating time, 370 (range, 190-540) min; median hospital stay, 7 (range, 3-54) days), seven patients had a staged laparoscopic resection of SCRLM and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (median operating time, 530 (range, 360-980) min; median hospital stay 14, (range, 6-51) days), and eight patients underwent laparoscopic colon resection and RFA of SCRLM (median operating time, 310 (range, 240-425) min; median hospital stay, 8 (range, 6-13) days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no conversions to an open procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall in-hospital morbidity and mortality was 28 and 0 % respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An R0 resection margin was achieved in 91 % of the resection group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 26 (range, 18-55) months, 19 (90 %) patients remain disease-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Totally laparoscopic strategies for the radical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> are feasible with low morbidity and favorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A laparoscopic approach for the simultaneous management of SCRLM and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> is associated with reduced surgical access trauma, postoperative morbidity, and hospital stay with no compromise in short-term oncological outcome </plain></SENT>
