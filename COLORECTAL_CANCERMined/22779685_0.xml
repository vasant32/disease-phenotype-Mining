<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental works demonstrated the role of autonomic nerves in the pineal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was supposed that mammalian pineals have lost their photoreceptor capacity that is present in submammalians, and sympathetic fibers would mediate light information from the retina to regulate <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> afferentation may reach the organ by central nerve fibers via the pineal habenulae as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our earlier works we have found that the pineal organ developing from lobular evaginations of the epithalamus differs from peripheral <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> glands and is composed of a retina-like central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissue that is comprised of cone-like pinealocytes, secondary pineal neurons and glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their autonomic nerves in submammalians as well as in mammalian animals do not terminate on pineal cells, rather, they run in the meningeal septa among pineal lobules and form vasomotor nerve endings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concerning the adult human pineal there are no detailed fine structural data about the termination of autonomic fibers, therefore, in the present work we investigated the ultrastructure of the human pineal peripheral autonomic nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was found, that similarly to other parts of the brain, autonomic nerves do not enter the human pineal <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissue itself but separated by glial limiting membranes take their course in the meningeal septa of the organ and terminate on vessels by vasomotor endings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suppose that these autonomic vasomotor nerves serve the regulation of the pineal blood supply according to the circadian and circannual changes of the metabolic activity of the organ and support by this effect the secretion of pineal neurohormones including <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
