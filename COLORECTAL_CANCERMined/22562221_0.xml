<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although there is convincing evidence that physical activity reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk, research in this area has focused on aerobic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether resistance training was associated with the risk of colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected on various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors, including recreational physical activity performed during three age periods, from 870 cases and 996 controls in Western Australia in 2005-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were classified as having never, possibly, or definitely performed resistance training in each age period and over the adult lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between resistance training and colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> risk was analyzed using multinomial logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants who definitely performed resistance training in their lifetime had a non-significant reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> compared with those who did no resistance training (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.70, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-1.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was found for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> risk (AOR = 1.16, 95 % CI = 0.71-1.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Performing resistance training was associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in each age period, although none of the relationships were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides some initial evidence, albeit inconclusive, that resistance training may be inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
