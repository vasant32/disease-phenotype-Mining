<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the main results of the 2010 survey of the Italian screening programmes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> carried out by the National centre for screening monitoring (Osservatorio nazionale screening, ONS) on behalf of the Ministry of health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the end of 2010, 105 programmes were active, 9 of which had been activated during the year, and 65% of Italians aged 50-69 years were residing in areas covered by organised screening programmes (theoretical extension) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve regions had their whole population covered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the South of Italy and Islands, 5 new programmes were activated in 2010, with a theoretical extension of 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of programmes employed the faecal occult blood test (FIT), while some adopted flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) once in a lifetime and FIT for non-responders to FS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, about 3,404,000 subjects were invited to undergo FIT, 47.2% of those to be invited within the year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted attendance rate was 48% and approximately 1,568,796 subjects were screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large differences in the attendance rate were observed among regions: 10% of programmes reported values lower than 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positivity rate of FIT programmes was 5.5% at first screening (range: 1.6-11.3%) and 4.3% at repeat screening (range: 3.2-6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average attendance rate to total colonoscopy (TC) was 81.4% and in one region it was lower than 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Completion rate for total colonoscopy (TC) was 88.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 740,281 subjects attending screening for the first time, the detection rate (DR) per 1,000 screened subjects was 2.4 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> and 10.3 for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (AA - <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with a diameter ≥1 cm, with villous/tubulo-villous type or with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As expected, the corresponding figures in the 843,204 subjects at repeat screening were lower (1.2‰ and 7.6‰ for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> and AA, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The DR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> increased with age and was higher among males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Many programmes reported some difficulties in guaranteeing TC in the appropriate time frame to FIT+ subjects: in 16% of cases the waiting time was longer than two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nine programmes employed FS as the screening test: 98% of the target population (about 60,000 subjects) were invited, and 13,629 subjects were screened, with an attendance rate of 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Overall, 87% of FS were classified as complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>TC referral rate was 9.5% and the DR per 1,000 screened subjects was 2.8 and 40.6 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> and AA, respectively </plain></SENT>
