<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, they are particularly likely to benefit from adherence to medical recommendations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite this increased risk, previous studies have shown an underutilization of colonoscopy for screening and a paucity of data on lifestyle habits that could enhance colonoscopy rates in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary aims were (a) to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening patterns and lifestyle choices among siblings and children of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, (b) to ascertain discrepancies between actual behavior and medical recommendations, and (c) to identify family members with multiple unhealthy lifestyle habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary aim was to test for possible associations between utilization rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and other preventive health services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study was conducted among 318 first-degree relatives (FDRs) of 164 CRC patients treated at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interviews were conducted with a structured questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was significant underutilization of colonoscopy for screening with only 73 FDRs (23.0 %) adhering to the recommended screening schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This rate was slightly improved (N = 58, 31.9 %) among subjects aged 40 years and above, although it was still far below the optimum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar result (N = 70, 21.7 %) was observed for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening tests and routine medical check-ups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant association (P &lt; 0.0001) was found for healthful lifestyles, overall use of preventive health services, and adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is significantly underutilized among FDRs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
