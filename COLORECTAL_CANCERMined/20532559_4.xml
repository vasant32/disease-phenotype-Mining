<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed and compared the immunohistochemical expression of the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as the microvessel density (MVD) in a series of 27 surgically resected colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> obtained from patients deceased because of disease progression and in a cohort of 25 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> from patients still alive with no evidence of disease progression 5 years after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of VEGF expression and of MVD on the overall survival to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A variable VEGF immunoexpression was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the analyzed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High VEGF expression was significantly more frequent among patients deceased of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients also displayed significantly higher MVD counts in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in comparison to the patients alive after 5 years from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both high VEGF expression and MVD appeared as significant negative prognostic markers related to a shorter overall survival to stage I colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, with VEGF representing an independent variable at multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VEGF assessment might be used in order to select those patients with a higher progression risk and to submit them to adjuvant therapies useful to prevent adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
