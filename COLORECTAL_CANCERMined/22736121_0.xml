<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the enhanced recovery program after surgery (ERAS) with conventional perioperative management in patients undergoing radical resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ERAS protocol included a combination of evidence-based and consensus methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 597 consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal resection were randomized to either the ERAS(n=299) or the control group(n=298) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes related to nutrition and metabolism index, stress index, and recovery index were measured and recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Demographics and operative parameters were similar between the two groups(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nutritional status of patients in the ERAS group was improved after surgery compared with that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day (POD) 1, the HOMA-IR in the ERAS group was significantly lower than that in the control group(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> level in the control group was elevated on both POD 1(P&lt;0.01) and POD 5(P&lt;0.01) compared to the preoperative level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> level was not increased until POD 5(P&lt;0.01) in the ERAS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ were reduced in the ERAS group, indicating less postoperative stress responses compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, ERAS group was associated with accelerated recovery of gastrointestinal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postoperative length of stay [(5.7±1.6) d vs. (6.6±2.4) d, P&lt;0.01] and expense[(15 998±2655) RMB vs. (17 763±3059) RMB, P&lt;0.01] were reduced in the ERAS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients(9.4%) in the control group and 29(9.7%) in the ERAS group developed complications, while the difference was not statistically significant(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ERAS protocol alleviates surgical stress response and accelerates postoperative recovery without compromising patient safety </plain></SENT>
