<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunomodulating diets have recently been used as a nutritional approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prebiotics, probiotics and symbiotics (a mixture of the first two) have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the Nutritional Status and Systemic Inflammatory Activity of colorectal patients on symbiotic supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was a progressive longitudinal study in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent assessment of nutritional status and subsequent serological analysis, daily use of the symbiotic supplement, anthropometric and biochemical assessment every three months Besides anthropometric data, the following blood components were measured: C-reactive protein (CRP), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean CRP level at baseline, before symbiotic administration, was 11 mg/dL, with a reduction to below 6 mg/dL at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a beneficial effect of symbiotic supplementation, because although albumin and CEA levels were stable during the study, there was a CRP reduction in meantime </plain></SENT>
