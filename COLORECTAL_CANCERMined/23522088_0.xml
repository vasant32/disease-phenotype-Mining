<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The loss of E-cadherin seems to be a crucial step in the process of Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EMT initiates invasion and proliferation in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Snail1 is known to be associated with poor outcome in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse its expression profile and prognostic significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue microarrays (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) containing paraffin-embedded primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) tissue samples from 251 patients were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of Snail1 and E-cadherin was assessed by immunohistochemistry in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> compartments, corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intensity of staining was classified according to the Remmele score (standardized scoring system) as well as the semiquantitative score established by Blechschmidt et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Snail1 expression was observed in 76% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss of E-cadherin was noted in 87% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Snail1 positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were significantly correlated with Snail1 positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between loss of E-cadherin and Snail1 expression, or between N-stage or grading and Snail1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis identified no prognostic impact of Snail1 expression on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Snail1 expression was detectable in most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> but showed no significant association with E-cadherin loss, clinical pathological characteristics or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The observed loss of E-cadherin could be explained by effects of other important EMT pathways, such as the Wnt-signalling cascade </plain></SENT>
