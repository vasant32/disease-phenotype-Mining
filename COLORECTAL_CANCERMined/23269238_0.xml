<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tautomycetin (TMC), originally isolated from Streptomyces griseochromogenes, has been suggested as a potential drug retaining specificity toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we found that TMC exhibited inhibitory effects on cell proliferation of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines including adriamycin-resistant human breast <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated its anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity and mechanisms in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that TMC effectively inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell proliferation, migration, and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TMC also induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in MCF-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This apoptotic response was in part mediated by Bcl-2 cleavage, leading to the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, which facilitates binding of Apaf-1 to caspase-9 in its presence and subsequent activation of caspase-7 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified that TMC induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by suppressing Akt signaling pathway activation, which is independent of protein phosphatase PP1 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of downstream targets of Akt, including phospho-forkhead transcription factor and Bad, were also reduced after TMC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results indicate that TMC could be used as a potential drug candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, our study provides new mechanisms for the anticancer effects of TMC </plain></SENT>
