<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designated to examine possible chemopreventive effects of DAS on colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> using genetically engineered transgenic ApcMin/⁺ mice, a well-established animal model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL/6J-ApcMin/⁺ mice were divided into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals of group 1 were placed on the basal diet (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIN</z:e>-76A) as non-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals of groups 2 and 3 were given DAS- containing diets (in doses of 100 and 300 ppm, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mice were sacrificed at the end of week 10 of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathological investigation revealed that the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> was decreased dose-dependently by 19% (13/16) in group 2 and by 32% (13/20) in group 3 compared to the 100% incidence (10/10) in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multiplicity of <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> per mouse was also slightly decreased by DAS treatment (1.88 ± 0.35 in group 2 and 1.63 ± 0.36 in group 3) compared to 2.00 ± 0.39 in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the numbers of total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> per mouse in the small intestine between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we suggest that DAS may exert promising inhibitory effects on colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in the transgenic ApcMin/⁺ mice </plain></SENT>
