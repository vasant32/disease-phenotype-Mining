<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations, measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, were elevated in 26 (37.7%) of 69 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and could not be detected among the 28 patients with benign intestinal conditions or 37 healthy individuals who comprised the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-CEA immuno globulin (Ig)G or IgM was detected by immunonephelometry in 44 (63.8%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, three (10.7%) with benign intestinal conditions and four (10.8%) healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in antibody detection frequencies between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patient group and the control groups were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Titres of anti-CEA correlated significantly with CEA levels and Dukes' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibody titre was an independent, significant, favourable predictor for 5-year recurrence-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that measurement of serum anti-CEA combined with CEA might be useful as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> marker and to assess prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results need to be confirmed in large, well-controlled, randomized clinical trials </plain></SENT>
