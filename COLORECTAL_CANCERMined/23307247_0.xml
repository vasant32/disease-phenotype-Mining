<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The roles of these iPS genes and especially the signature for these iPS genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overexpressed Oct4 and Lin28 but down-regulated Nanog were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues compared with that in their paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that Oct4, Lin28 and Nanog were highly overexpressed in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And the signature for iPS genes was correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site (P = 0.012), lymph node status (P = 0.033), Dukes classification (P = 0.033) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an independent public expression profiling data showed signature for the four iPS genes could successfully be used to predict the survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with Dukes stages B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent staining of fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues from patients showed that strong co-expressions of Oct4 and Nanog proteins or Sox2 and Lin28 were present in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell subclone with four iPS genes overexpression were establish by a mixed retroviral system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that iPS genes promote sphere-formation, proliferation, colony formation, migration of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in vitro and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study first shows the clinical significance of iPS signature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
