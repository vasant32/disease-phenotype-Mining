<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The resectability of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> is in part largely based on the surgeon's assessment of cross-sectional imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This process, while guided by principles, is subjective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to assess agreement between hepatic surgeons regarding the resectability of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six hepatic surgeons across Canada were invited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A patient with biologically favourable disease was presented after having received neoadjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The scenario was matched with 10 different scrollable abdominal CT scans representing a maximum response after six cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgeons were asked to offer an opinion on resectability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, and whether they would use adjunct modalities to hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six surgeons participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty responses were complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median number of scenarios deemed resectable was 6/10 (range 3-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two control scenarios demonstrated perfect agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Agreement on resectability was poor for 4/8 test scenarios, of which one scenario demonstrated complete disagreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among resectable cases, the pattern of use of adjunct modalities was variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A median ratio of 0.87 adjunct modality per resectable scenario per surgeon was used (range 0.25-1.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significant lack of agreement was identified among surgeons on the resectability and use of adjunct modalities in the treatment of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
