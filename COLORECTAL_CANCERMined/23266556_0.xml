<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying the genetic loci associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> formation could elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study that included 14 studies, 12,696 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> (11,870 cancer, 826 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>), and 15,113 controls of European descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 10 most statistically significant, previously unreported findings were followed up in 6 studies; these included 3056 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cases (2098 cancer, 958 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>) and 6658 controls of European and Asian descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on the combined analysis, we identified a locus that reached the conventional genome-wide significance level at less than 5.0 × 10(-8): an intergenic region on chromosome 2q32.3, close to nucleic acid binding protein 1 (most significant single nucleotide polymorphism: rs11903757; odds ratio [OR], 1.15 per risk allele; P = 3.7 × 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found evidence for 3 additional loci with P values less than 5.0 × 10(-7): a locus within the laminin gamma 1 gene on chromosome 1q25.3 (rs10911251; OR, 1.10 per risk allele; P = 9.5 × 10(-8)), a locus within the cyclin D2 gene on chromosome 12p13.32 (rs3217810 per risk allele; OR, 0.84; P = 5.9 × 10(-8)), and a locus in the T-box 3 gene on chromosome 12q24.21 (rs59336; OR, 0.91 per risk allele; P = 3.7 × 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large genome-wide association study, we associated polymorphisms close to nucleic acid binding protein 1 (which encodes a DNA-binding protein involved in DNA repair) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also provided evidence for an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> risk and polymorphisms in laminin gamma 1 (this is the second gene in the laminin family to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>), cyclin D2 (which encodes for cyclin D2), and T-box 3 (which encodes a T-box transcription factor and is a target of Wnt signaling to β-catenin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The roles of these genes and their products in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> pathogenesis warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
