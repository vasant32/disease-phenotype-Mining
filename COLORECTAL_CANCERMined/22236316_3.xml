<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that rural minority populations experience disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, treatment, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown how race/ethnicity and rurality intersect in these disparities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this analysis is to examine the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening rates among minorities in rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We utilized the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to examine rates of screening for breast, cervical, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bivariate analysis estimated screening rates by rurality and sociodemographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis estimated the factors that contributed to the odds of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rural residents were less likely to obtain screenings than urban residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>African Americans were more likely to be screened than whites or Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Race/ethnicity and rurality interacted, showing that African American women continued to be more likely than whites to be screened for breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e>, but the odds decreased with rurality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirmed previous research which found that rural residents were less likely to obtain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screenings than other residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We further found that the pattern of disparity differed according to race/ethnicity, with African Americans having favorable odds of receipt of service regardless of rurality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results have the potential to create better targeted interventions to those groups that continue to be underserved </plain></SENT>
