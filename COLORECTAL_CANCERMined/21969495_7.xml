<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 38) not previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> received P-CAP (perifosine 50 mg orally once daily, days 1 to 21 and CAP 825 mg/m(2) orally twice daily, days 1 to 14) or CAP (825 mg/m(2) orally twice daily, days 1 to 14) in 21-day cycles until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), safety, and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomly assigned to P-CAP and 18 to CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (27.5 v 10.1 weeks; P &lt; .001) and median OS (17.7 v 7.6 months; P = .0052) were improved in patients receiving P-CAP versus CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ORR was 20% v 7% in the P-CAP and CAP groups, respectively, and one patient in the P-CAP group had a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subset analysis of fluorouracil-refractory patients showed a median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> of 17.6 v 9.0 weeks (P &lt; .001) and median OS of 15.1 v 6.5 months (P = .0061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Toxicities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e>, were manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: P-CAP showed promising clinical activity compared with CAP in previously treated patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A phase III trial is underway comparing P-CAP with CAP in patients with refractory mCRC </plain></SENT>
