<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) were used to stage adults over 50 years of age (N = 2324) using a modified version of the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) staging algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Health perceptions examined included perceived risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, worry about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, fatalism, and beliefs about ambiguity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Meaningful differences in patterns of relationships among health perceptions by stage were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The nonlinear patterns that emerged indicate support for the role of these health perceptions in screening, the idea that behavioral readiness may moderate the relationship between important health perceptions, and the use of the stage construct in this context </plain></SENT>
