<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">Glucosamine</z:chebi> and chondroitin are non-vitamin, non-mineral supplements which have anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These supplements are typically used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> and are commonly taken as either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> alone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> plus chondroitin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An exploratory analysis conducted within the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) study observed any use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> and chondroitin to be associated with reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) after 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With two additional years of follow-up, we have studied these associations in greater depth, including associations by frequency/duration of use and by formulation, and have evaluated whether observed associations are modified by factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants include 75,137 western Washington residents aged 50-76 who completed the mailed VITAL questionnaire between 2000 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> and chondroitin was ascertained by questions about supplement use during the 10-year period prior to baseline, and participants were followed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> through 2008 (n = 557) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Persons reporting use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> + chondroitin on 4+ days/week for 3+ years had a non-statistically significant 45 % lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk than non-users (HR: 0.55; 95 % CI 0.30-1.01; p-trend: 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association varied by body mass index (p-interaction: 0.006), with inverse association observed among the overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (p-trend: 0.02), but not among the underweight/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> alone was not significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is great need to identify safe and effective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> preventive strategies, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> and chondroitin may merit further attention as a potential chemopreventive agent </plain></SENT>
