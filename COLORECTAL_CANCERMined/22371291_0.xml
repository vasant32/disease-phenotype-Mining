<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Dysregulation of toll-like receptors (TLR) signaling can result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory and over-exuberant repair responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and clinical relevance of TLR in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression levels of six TLR were analyzed in 70 patients with different histological types of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 38 of which developed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These analyses were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TLR9 expression was higher in hyperplastic or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> compared to other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>Hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> also showed increased TLR7 levels compared to the other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TLR7 expression was lower in both hyperplastic and tubulovillous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> from patients who developed CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TLR9 expression was decreased in hyperplastic and villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> from patients who developed CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a possible protective role of TLR expression against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in the colorectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TLR may represent a pathological marker of CC risk in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of these factors in the pathology of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
