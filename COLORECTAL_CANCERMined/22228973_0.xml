<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore germline hypermethylation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes MLH1, CDH1 and P16(INK4a) in suspected cases of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (GC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A group of 140 Chinese GC patients in whom the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> had developed before the age of 60 or who had a familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were screened for germline hypermethylation of the MLH1, CDH1 and P16(INK4a) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and modified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26709">sodium bisulfite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treated DNA was then subjected to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> DNA sequencing for a specific region of the MLH1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of CDH1 or P16(INK4a) was assayed using methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clonal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> allelic sequencing in positive samples was performed to obtain a comprehensive analysis of the CpG island methylation status of these promoter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter was detected in the peripheral blood DNA of only 1/140 (0.7%) of the GC patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this methylation pattern was mosaic rather than the allelic pattern which has previously been reported for MLH1 in hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that 10% of the MLH1 alleles in the peripheral blood DNA of this patient were methylated, consistent with 20% of cells having one methylated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No germline promoter methylation of the CDH1 or P16(INK4a) genes was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mosaic germline epimutation of the MLH1 gene is present in suspected hereditary GC patients in China but at a very low level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Germline epimutation of the CDH1 or P16(INK4a) gene is not a frequent event </plain></SENT>
