<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enzymes metabolizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCAs</z:e> may influence the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> depending on the enzyme activity level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess effect modification by polymorphisms in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>-metabolizing genes on the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> intake with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA) risk, which are precursors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study nested in the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 1994 and 2005, 413 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cases were identified and 796 controls were matched to cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined and used to predict phenotypes (i.e., enzyme activities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CRA risk was positively associated with PhIP, MeIQx, and DiMeIQx (p trend = 0.006, 0.022, and 0.045, respectively) intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SULT1A1 phenotypes modified the effect of MeIQx on CRA risk (p (Interaction) &gt; 0.01) such that the association of MeIQx intake with CRA was stronger for slow than for <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotypes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other modifying effects by phenotypes did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> intake is positively associated with CRA risk, regardless of phenotypes involved in the metabolizing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Due to the number of comparisons made in the analysis, the modifying effect of SULT1A1 on the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> intake with CRA risk may be due to chance </plain></SENT>
