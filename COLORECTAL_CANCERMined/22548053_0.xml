<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several attempts to improve endoscopic technology have been made in order to improve the detection rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, especially in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the latest evidence on the long-term efficacy of screening tests, new strategies including endoscopic and faecal modalities have also been proposed in order to improve participation and the diagnostic yield of programmatic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, several factors in terms of both efficacy and costs of screening strategies, including the high cost of biological therapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, are likely to affect the cost-effectiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in the future </plain></SENT>
