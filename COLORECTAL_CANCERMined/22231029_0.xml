<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we retrospectively investigated the relation between perioperative change in peripheral blood monocyte count and disease-free as well as overall survival after hepatic resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CRLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 64 patients who underwent hepatic resection for CRLM between January 2000 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively investigated the relation between perioperative change in peripheral blood monocyte count and disease-free as well as overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, more than four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> (P = 0.0298) and extrahepatic disease (P = 0.0423) were significant predictors of disease-free survival, while significant predictor of overall survival were more than four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> (P = 0.0011), bilobar disease (P = 0.0024), and increase in perioperative monocyte less than twice (P = 0.0029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morover, increase in perioperative monocyte of less than twice positively correlated with intraoperative blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative change in peripheral blood monocyte count is an independent risk factor for overall survival after hepatic resection for CRLM, and may reflect immunosuppressive state </plain></SENT>
