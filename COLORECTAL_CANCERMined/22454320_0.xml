<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chemotherapeutic drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) is widely used for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Response to 5-FU treatment is variable with 10-30% of patients experiencing serious toxicity partly explained by reduced activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DPD converts endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> (U) into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15901">5,6-dihydrouracil</z:chebi> (UH(2) ), and analogously, 5-FU into 5-fluoro-5,6-dihydrouracil (5-FUH(2) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined quantification of U and UH(2) with 5-FU and 5-FUH(2) may provide a pre-therapeutic assessment of DPD activity and further guide drug dosing during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the development of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for simultaneous quantification of U, UH(2) , 5-FU and 5-FUH(2) in human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction with 10:1 ethyl <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-2-propanol (v/v) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evaporated samples were reconstituted in 0.1% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30751">formic acid</z:chebi> and 10 μL aliquots were injected into the HPLC system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyte separation was achieved on an Atlantis dC(18) column with a mobile phase consisting of 1.0 mm <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, 0.5 mm <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30751">formic acid</z:chebi> and 3.3% <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positively ionized analytes were detected by multiple reaction monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analytical response was linear in the range 0.01-10 μm for U, 0.1-10 μm for UH(2) , 0.1-75 μm for 5-FU and 0.75-75 μm for 5-FUH(2) , covering the expected concentration ranges in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The method was validated following the FDA guidelines and applied to clinical samples obtained from ten 5-FU-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present method merges the analysis of 5-FU pharmacokinetics and DPD activity into a single assay representing a valuable tool to improve the efficacy and safety of 5-FU-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
