<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>KLK10 is a secreted protease with a trypsin-like activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The function of KLK10 is poorly understood, although it has been suggested that KLK10 may function as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, KLK10 gene shows organ-specific up- or down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since KLKs are promising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biomarkers, the examination of KLK10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and its association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) progression was studied using semi-quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and nineteen primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens were examined for which follow-up information was available for a median period of 29 months (range, 1-104 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KLK10 expression was found to be significantly associated with TNM stage (p=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard regression model using univariate analysis revealed for the first time that high status KLK10 expression is a significant factor for disease-free survival (DFS; p=0.002) and overall survival (OS; p=0.026) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that KLK10 expression of low status is significantly associated with longer DFS (p=0.001) as well as OS (p=0.021), suggesting that KLK10 gene expression may be used as a marker of unfavorable prognosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the epigenetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are unraveled, KLK10 may represent not only a novel biomarker, but also a promising future therapeutic target for the disease </plain></SENT>
