<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are tiny, noncoding, small, endogenous <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that play major roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> and could therefore offer a better quantitative and noninvasive method for the diagnosis and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) using feces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we screened feces for 648 miRNAs and analyzed the role of miR-144* as a potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnostic marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fecal miRNA expression was profiled with RT-pre-amplification-qPCR, and the stability was determined using both endogenous and exogenous miRNA by RT-qPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ROC analysis was performed to enhance the diagnosing power of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients' fecal specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected 39% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the miRNAs screened in feces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endogenous miRNAs are more stable over time and temperature, while exogenous miRNAs degraded rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>miR-144* was overexpressed in feces, suggesting that it could be a potent candidate diagnostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection, with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 87% (n = 75, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RT-qPCR analysis showed that miR-144* was also overexpressed in paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues, thus suggesting its possible utilization as a diagnostic marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that miRNAs are stable in the fecal microenvironment, and that, among them, miR-144* represents a novel fecal-based diagnostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our data need to be validated in a large cohort of subjects </plain></SENT>
