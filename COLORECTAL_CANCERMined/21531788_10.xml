<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>)-associated polymorphisms using genome-wide association (GWA) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to fine-map the location of the functional variants for three of these regions at 8q23.3 (EIF3H), 16q22.1 (CDH1/CDH3) and 19q13.11 (RHPN2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped two case-control sets at high density in the selected regions and used existing data from four other case-control sets, comprising a total of 9328 CRC cases and 10 480 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To improve marker density, we imputed genotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and Hapmap3 data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three regions contained smaller areas in which a cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed clearly stronger association signals than surrounding SNPs, allowing us to assign those areas as the most likely location of the disease-associated functional variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further fine-mapping within those areas was generally unhelpful in identifying the functional variation based on strengths of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, functional annotation suggested a relatively small number of functional SNPs, including some with potential regulatory function at 8q23.3 and 16q22.1 and a non-synonymous SNP in RPHN2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression quantitative trait locus browser showed a number of highly associated SNP alleles correlated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels not of EIF3H and CDH1 or CDH3, but of UTP23 and ZFP90, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the top SNPs within these regions was associated with transcript levels at EIF3H, CDH1 or CDH3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our post-GWA study highlights benefits of fine-mapping of common disease variants in combination with publicly available data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, caution should be exercised when assigning functionality to candidate genes in regions discovered through GWA analysis </plain></SENT>
