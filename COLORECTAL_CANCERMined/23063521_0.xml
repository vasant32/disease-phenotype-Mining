<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the improvement of median overall survival, resistance is observed notably due to KRAS and BRAF gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We synthesized four series of thienopyrimidines whose scaffold is structurally close to TKI used in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by these compounds using flow cytometry on KRAS and BRAF mutated cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that the mutated cell lines (HCT116 and HT29) are more resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than the non-mutated cell line (Hela) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, among the 13 compounds tested, three of them (5b, 6b and 6d) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi> exhibited a noteworthy pro-apoptotic effect, especially on mutated cell lines with an IC(50) value between 70 and 110Î¼M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These three compounds seem particularly attractive for the development of novel treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients harboring EGFR pathway mutations </plain></SENT>
