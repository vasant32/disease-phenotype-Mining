<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We measured the prevalence of stigma, self-blame, and perceived blame from others for their illness among men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and examined whether these factors were associated with depressive symptoms, independent of clinical and sociodemographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires were returned in the fall of 2009 by 1109 eligible male US veterans who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at any Veterans Affairs facility in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires assessed stigma, feelings of blame, and depressive symptoms as well as other facets of health, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> characteristics, and quality and type of medical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stigma, self-blame, and perceived blame from others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used multivariate linear regression to assess the association between these factors and a measure of depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Covariates included several measures of overall health, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e>, symptom severity, and sociodemographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty one percent of respondents endorsed at least one item in a measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stigma and 25% reported feeling that it was at least 'a little true' that they were to blame for their illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three independent variables were associated with depressive symptoms in bivariate models; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stigma and self-blame were significantly associated with depressive symptoms in the multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> stigma and self-blame are problems for a significant minority of men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and are independent predictors of depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They may represent an important source of stress in men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
