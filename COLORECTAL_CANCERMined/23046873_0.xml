<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gene targeting is a powerful method that can be used for examining the functions of genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, the construction of knockout (KO) vectors requires an amplification step to obtain two homologous, large fragments of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Restriction enzymes that cut at unique recognitions sites and numerous cloning steps are then carried out; this is often a time-consuming and frustrating process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have developed a one-step cloning method for the insertion of two arms into a KO vector using exonuclease III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We modified an adeno-associated virus KO shuttle vector (pTK-LoxP-NEO-AAV) to yield pAAV-LIC, which contained two cassettes at the two multiple-cloning sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vector was digested with EcoRV to give two fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two homologous arms, which had an overlap of 16 bases with the ends of the vector fragments, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After purification, the four fragments were mixed and treated with exonuclease III, then transformed into Escherichia coli to obtain the desired clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using this method, we constructed SirT1 and HDAC2 KO vectors, which were used to establish SirT1 KO cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line (HCT116) and HDAC2 KO cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line (DLD1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our method is a fast, simple, and efficient technique for cloning, and has great potential for high-throughput construction of KO vectors </plain></SENT>
