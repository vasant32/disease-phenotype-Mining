<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The YDR risk assessment tool was administered to 3,317 asymptomatic average risk patients 50 to 79 years of age just before their screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations between YDR-derived relative risk (RR) scores and ACN prevalence were examined using logistic regression and χ(2) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACN was defined as a tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> ≥1 cm, tubulovillous or villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> of any size, and the presence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of ACN was 5.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although YDR-derived RR scores were linearly associated with ACN after adjusting for age and gender (P = 0.033), the index was unable to discriminate "below average" from "above/average" risk patients [OR, 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-1.37] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considerable overlap in rates of ACN was also observed between the different YDR risk categories in our age- and gender-stratified analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The YDR index lacks accuracy for stratifying average risk patients into low- versus intermediate/high-risk categories for ACN </plain></SENT>
