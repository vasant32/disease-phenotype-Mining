<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of EGFR, Ki67, and p53 was performed in tissue microarray slides of 9 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glandular tissues and 150 specimens including 49 well, 58 moderately, and 43 poorly differentiated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in intensity of EGFR immunostaining and the percentages of Ki67 and p53 positive cells between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens were evaluated using the Student t-test, one-way ANOVA, and linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intensity of EGFR staining was weak and nuclear expression of Ki67 and p53 was scattered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 control specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of Ki67 and p53 but not EGFR was significantly higher in more advanced grades and TNM stages of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages of Ki67 and p53 stained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were significantly higher in moderately (Ki67: 60.3 ± 6.5, p53: 47.6 ± 3.8) and poorly (Ki67: 61.8 ± 5.3, p53: 55.1 ± 4.1) differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells than in well differentiated (Ki67: 40.8 ± 4.4, p53: 39.8 ± 4.2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the Ki67 and p53 staining intensity was also significantly correlated with the more advanced T, N and American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (AJCC) clinical stage of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, suggesting their usefulness as biomarkers of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, EGFR immunochemistry may not be a good method for pre-treatment evaluation of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
