<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The remaining 847 patients were treated with palliative chemotherapy and/or palliative resection combined with best supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Palliative resection was performed in 527 (62.2%) cases (complete resection with negative margin (R0) in 93, R1/2 in 434) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resected patients had a more prolonged median overall survival (OS) than unresected patients (21.3 vs 14.1 months; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, R0 resection was found to be associated with a superior OS compared with R1/2 resection (51.3 vs 19.1 months; P&lt;0.001) and no resection (51.3 vs 14.1 months; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When we performed propensity score matching, palliative resection was found to be related to prolonged OS (hazard ratio=0.72, 95% confidence interval=0.59-0.89; P=0.003).Conclusion:Palliative resection without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> and chemotherapy confers a longer-term survival outcome than palliative chemotherapy alone in mCRC patient subset.British Journal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> advance online publication, 12 March 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.94 www.bjcancer.com </plain></SENT>
