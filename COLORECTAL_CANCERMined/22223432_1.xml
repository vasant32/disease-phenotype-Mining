<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed the allele discrimination assay, which uses dual-color real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as a fast K-ras genotyping method, and demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than DNA sequencing with formalin-fixed paraffin tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The assay detected K-ras mutations among 83 of 204 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (40.7%); 20.6% of these mutations were G12D (GAT) mutations, 7.4% were G13D (GAC) and G12V (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>), and 5.3% were other types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of females was observed overall in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with K-ras mutations (60.2%, P = 0.01), codon 12 mutations (63.2%, P = 0.005), and transversions (69.6%, P = 0.02), which reflected the higher prevalence of females among the well- to moderately differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (29% in males vs. 53% in females; interaction P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The opposite was observed for poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (47% in males vs. 35% in females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant influence of age was found on the prevalence of K-ras mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Males with pathological changes and females with poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> displayed GAT as a less common genotype compared with most other prevalence studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, allele discrimination, with no additional amplification step, is a fast and reliable genotyping method for detecting K-ras c12-13 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using this method, we demonstrate differences in the frequencies of K-ras genotypes by gender and pathologic phenotypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
