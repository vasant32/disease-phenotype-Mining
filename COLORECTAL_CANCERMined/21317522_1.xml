<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (CRCS) rate changes for patients who received flu shots versus those who did not receive flu shots during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-FOBT Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of data from the year prior to the intervention was used to validate the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rates of CRCS increased by 18.0 percentage points for flu shot recipients during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-FOBT Program vs. 1.7 percentage points for flu shot non-recipients (p&lt;.001 for change difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the year prior to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-FOBT Program, flu shot recipients had only a 3.3 percentage point increase in the CRCS rate vs. a 1.9 percentage point decline for flu shot non-recipients (p=.08 for change difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-FOBT Program as adapted was effective at increasing CRCS rates for primary care patients in this low-income Chinese American community </plain></SENT>
