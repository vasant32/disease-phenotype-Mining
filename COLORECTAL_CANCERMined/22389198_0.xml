<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Brown rice fermented with Aspergillus oryzae, designated as FBRA, is a dietary fiber-rich food, and fully appreciated as one of the prebiotics, which are generally considered to be beneficial to the health of the body, because of stimulating the growth and/or the activity of bacteria in the digestive system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the effectiveness of FBRA as a functional food, the direct effect of FBRA extract on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> cells was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exposure of HCT116 cells to FBRA extract reduced their viabilities in a concentration-dependent manner, and the reduction of the cell viability might be attributed to the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> probably through the oxidative damage to the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further studies showed that FBRA extract caused a significant elevation of Bax protein and a slight reduction of Bcl2 protein levels, and furthermore caused the activation of caspase-3 in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that FBRA extract can exert oxidative damage to the cells, resulting in apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by activating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, daily intake of FBRA can be expected to be beneficial for preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and/or suppressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in the digestive tract </plain></SENT>
