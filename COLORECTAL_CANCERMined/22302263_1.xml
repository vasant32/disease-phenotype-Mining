<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy remains the mainstay treatment for clinical T1bN0M0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> because pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> in these patients are not negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, chemoradiotherapy (CRT), which can preserve the esophagus, has been reported to be a promising therapeutic alternative to esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, to our knowledge, no comparative studies of esophagectomy and CRT have been reported in clinical T1bN0M0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 173 patients with clinical T1bN0M0 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the thoracic esophagus were enrolled in this study, 102 of whom were treated with radical esophagectomy (S group) and 71 with definitive CRT (CRT group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment results of both groups were retrospectively compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found in overall survival, but the S group displayed significantly better progression-free survival than the CRT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease recurrence was observed in 12 S group patients and 20 CRT group patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of distant recurrence was similar, while local recurrence and lymph node recurrence were significantly more frequent in the CRT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the S group, 20 patients had pathologic lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The progression-free survival of patients with pathologic lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> did not differ from those without nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the CRT group, local recurrence could be controlled by salvage esophagectomy, but treatment results of lymph node recurrence were poor; only 4 of 12 patients with lymph node recurrences were cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Selection of patients at high risk of pathologic lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> is essential when formulating treatment decisions for clinical T1bN0M0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
