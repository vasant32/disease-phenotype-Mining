<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) is a downstream integrator of essential pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>mTOR signaling is frequently dysregulated in a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and in silico analysis has revealed two miR-144 binding sites in the mTOR 3' untranslated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the clinicopathologic magnitude of the mTOR pathway regulating microRNA, miR-144 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regulation of mTOR by miR-144 was examined with inhibitor miR-144-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated changes in sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi>, in inhibitor miR-144-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate the clinicopathologic significance of miR-144 expression in 137 CRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we assessed the correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis and the expression of 16 genes in the Akt/mTOR pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro assays showed that mTOR is a direct target of miR-144, and downregulation of miR-144 facilitated proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line, HT29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the viability of HT29 cells with downregulated miR-144 expression was significantly reduced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low expression levels of miR-144 were associated with enhanced malignant potential such as venous invasion (P = 0.0013), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (P = 0.08), liver recurrence (P = 0.0058) and poor prognosis (P = 0.0041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that low miR-144 expression was an independent prognostic factor for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among many genes consisting of the mTOR pathway, only high expression of Rictor was associated with poor prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>miR-144 is a meaningful prognostic marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of miR-144 leads to poor prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients via activation of the mTOR signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
