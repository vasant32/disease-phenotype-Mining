<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from South Australian Clinical Registry for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1st February 2006 and 9th September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who received chemotherapy were analysed to assess the impact of single versus combination chemotherapy and to assess the outcome in two age cohorts, age &lt; 70 years and ≥ 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of a total of 1745 patients in the database during this time period, 951 (54.5%) received systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>286 (30%) received first line therapy (median age 74 years) with single agent fluoropyrimidine and 643 patients (68%) received first line combination chemotherapy (median age 64 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival of patients receiving first line combination chemotherapy was 23.9 months compared to 17.2 months for those who received single agent fluoropyrimidine (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination chemotherapy was given to 81% of patients aged &lt; 70 years compared to 53% of those ≥ 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in median overall survival of patients receiving chemotherapy by age cohort, 21.3 months for age &lt;70 years and 21.1 months for age ≥ 70 years (p = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment outcomes are comparable in both the elderly and younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who received initial combination chemotherapy were younger and had a longer median overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our study, age appeared to influence the treatment choices but not necessarily outcome </plain></SENT>
