<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze in vivo and in vitro responses to an 'ideal' Wnt pathway inhibitor as a model for the therapeutic targeting of the pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-inducible transgenic mouse model expressing truncated β-catenin (ΔN89β-catenin) that exhibited a strong intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was analyzed during the removal of oncogenic β-catenin expression both in 3D 'crypt culture' and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oncogenic Wnt signaling was rapidly and completely reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest inhibition of Wnt target gene expression occurred within 24 h of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> removal at which time the target genes Ascl2, Axin2 and C-myc were downregulated to levels below that in the control intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the small molecule Wnt inhibitor CCT036477 induced a response within 4 h of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By 7 days following <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> withdrawal, gene expression, cell proliferation and tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were undistinguishable from control animals.In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the reversal of Wnt signaling by inhibitors should ideally be studied within hours of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reversible system described, involving medium throughput in vitro approaches and rapid in vivo responses, should allow the rapid advance of early stage compounds into efficacy models that are more usually considered later in the drug discovery pipeline </plain></SENT>
