<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients, who had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> 1250-2000 mg/m² biweekly in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1700-2000 mg/m²/day, d1-7 every two weeks were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had previously received at least three chemotherapy regimens and 12 (55%) had also received a 4th line regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had been treated with a monoclonal antibody either against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) (only if <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients had had blood tests weekly, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level measurement every 4 weeks and radiological assessment of their disease with CT scans every 8/9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty two patients were included; male-female, 14:8; age ranged from 43-73 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients (17/22) had performance status (PS) ECOG 0-1 and the remaining patients (5/22) had PS 2 at the time of initiation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi>-based regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients demonstrated a clinical benefit (2 partial response, 2 minor response, 9 stable disease), 6 patients progressed and 2 were not evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">Gemcitabine</z:chebi> has a modest activity in heavily pre-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and may be an option in good performance status patients </plain></SENT>
