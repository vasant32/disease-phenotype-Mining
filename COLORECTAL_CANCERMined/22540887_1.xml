<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> prevalence among asymptomatic white, black and Hispanic patients undergoing screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross sectional cohort study, data from individuals â‰¥50 years undergoing first-time colonoscopy since 2006 at a single tertiary-care medical centre were obtained from the electronic medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> prevalence among whites, blacks and Hispanics was calculated; multivariate Poisson and logistic regression were used to identify factors independently associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> rates and the presence of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 5075 eligible subjects: 3542 (70%) whites, 942 (18%) Hispanics and 591 (12%) blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 62.2 years with 58% women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was detected in 19%, 22% and 26% of whites, Hispanics and blacks respectively (Hispanics vs. whites P = 0.09; blacks vs. whites P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolated proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were present in 9% of whites, 11% of Hispanics (P = 0.03) and 11% of blacks (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, a higher rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was present in Hispanics (RR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.20-1.57) and blacks (RR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.52-2.04) than whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hispanics and blacks also had an increased risk of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> compared to whites (OR(Hispanics) : 2.25, 95% CI: 1.62-3.11; OR(blacks) : 1.91, 95% CI: 1.27-2.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> prevalence was higher in blacks and Hispanics than in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both groups were at greater risk of having proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in the absence of any distal pathology than whites, where these lesions would have only been detected by colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Efforts to promote screening are necessary among diverse, under-represented populations </plain></SENT>
