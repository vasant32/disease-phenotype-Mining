<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we provide the first in vivo proof-of-concept for a theranostic approach as treatment modality in a human xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A DOTA-conjugated 9-mer high affinity uPAR binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (DOTA-AE105) was radiolabeled with (64)Cu and (177)Lu, for PET imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy study, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human uPAR-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> HT-29 cells were inoculated in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>Nude</z:mp> mice and treated with (177)Lu-DOTA-AE105 once a visible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the true effect of the targeted radiotherapy, two controls groups were included in this study, one receiving a (177)Lu-labeled non-binding control <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and one receiving vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were treated day 0 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A parallel (18)F-FLT PET/CT study was performed on day 0, 1, 3 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dosimetry calculations were based on a biodistribution study, where organs and tissue of interest were collected 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 24h post injection of (177)Lu-DOTA-AE105 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was assessed by recording mouse weight and by H&amp;E staining of kidneys in each treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: uPAR-positive HT-29 xenograft was clearly visualized by PET/CT imaging using (64)Cu-DOTA-AE105 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, these xenograft transplants were locally irradiated using (177)Lu-DOTA-AE105, where a significant effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and the number of uPAR-positive cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was found (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evaluations of biodistribution and dosimetry revealed highest accumulation of radioactivity in kidneys and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FLT PET/CT imaging study revealed a significant correlation between (18)F-FLT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake and efficacy of the radionuclide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A histological examination of the kidneys from one animal in each treatment group did not reveal any gross abnormalities and the general performance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated animals also showed no indications of radioactivity-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings document for the first time the in vivo efficacy of an uPAR-targeted radionuclide therapeutic intervention on both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and its content of uPAR expressing cells thus setting the stage for future translation into clinical use </plain></SENT>
