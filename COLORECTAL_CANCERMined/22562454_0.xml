<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increased levels of secondary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> after <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> disease and cholecystectomy are believed to increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether there is a similar risk of developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the risk of developing colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> following <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> disease or cholecystectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was based on a systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents (1950-2012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selection criteria were developed to sort for studies exploring the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo>, cholecystectomy, and colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in an adult population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A random-effects model was used to generate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Publication bias and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1,276 studies identified, 14 were suitable for final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 253,059 subjects in total, 42,543 of whom were diagnosed with colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, and 28,281 of whom had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> or underwent cholecystectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant risk of developing colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> if <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> were present (OR = 2.26; 95 % CI = 1.83-2.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A risk was also seen with cholecystectomy (OR = 1.15; 95 % CI = 1.04-1.26), but this risk was negated when only adjusted odds were selected (OR = 1.01; 95 % CI = 0.91-1.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No publication bias and only low levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>Gallstones</z:hpo> increase the risk of colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No association exists with cholecystectomy </plain></SENT>
