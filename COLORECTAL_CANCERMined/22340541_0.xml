<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this research was to study the clinical efficacy of fish oil enriched total parenteral nutrition in elderly patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received isocaloric and isonitrogenous total parenteral nutrition by continuous infusion (20 - 24 hours per day) for seven days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group (n = 28) received 1.2 g/kg soybean oil per day, whereas the treatment group (n = 29) received 0.2 g/kg fish oil and 1.0 g/kg soybean oil per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken pre-operatively, and at days one and eight after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α (TNF-α) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were then analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient characteristics were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At day eight post-surgery, IL-6, TNF-α and CD8 titres were lower in the treatment group when compared to the control group; these results reached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group, there were fewer infectious complications and incidences of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIRS</z:e>), and shorter lengths of hospital stay were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The total cost of medical care was comparable for the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse events occurred in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fish oil 0.2 g/kg per day administrated to elderly patients after colorectal surgery was safe and may shorten the length of hospital stay and improve clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
