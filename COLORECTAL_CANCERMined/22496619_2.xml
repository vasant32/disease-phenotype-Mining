<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which constitutively activated KRAS (KRAS(G12V)) impairs effector mechanisms of EGFR-Abs are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we established isogenic cell line models to systematically investigate the impact of KRAS(G12V) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in mouse A431 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> as well as on various modes of action triggered by EGFR-Abs in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KRAS(G12V) impaired EGFR-Ab-mediated growth inhibition by stimulating receptor-independent downstream signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS(G12V) also rendered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells less responsive to Fc-mediated effector mechanisms of EGFR-Abs-such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Impaired CDC and ADCC activities could be linked to reduced EGFR expression in KRAS-mutated versus <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) cells, which was restored by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of KRAS4b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry experiments also revealed lower EGFR expression in KRAS-mutated versus KRAS-wt harboring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses of potential mechanisms by which KRAS(G12V) downregulated EGFR expression demonstrated significantly decreased activity of six distinct transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments suggested the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family to be implicated in the regulation of EGFR promoter activity in KRAS-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells by suppressing EGFR transcription through up-regulation of the inhibitory family member C/EBPβ-LIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, siRNA-mediated knockdown of C/EBPβ led to enhanced EGFR expression and Ab-mediated cytotoxicity against KRAS-mutated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, these results demonstrate that KRAS(G12V) signaling induced C/EBPβ-dependent suppression of EGFR expression, thereby impairing Fc-mediated effector mechanisms of EGFR-Abs and rendering KRAS-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells less sensitive to these therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
