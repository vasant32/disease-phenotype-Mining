<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: With fast track surgery and shorter hospital stay, discharge from hospital after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery is becoming more challenging for the individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore how patients perceive information after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, what their information needs are and to determine factors affecting received information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A hundred patients filled in the questionnaires QLQ-C30, CR38 and INFO25 created by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>, the Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) instrument and the SOC (sense of coherence) instrument and provided written comments within the first 2 weeks after discharge following surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The questionnaires were analysed using hierarchical cluster analysis and a multiple linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The written comments were analysed using content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 49% of the patients expressed a need for more information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the written comments they specified these areas of information: they lacked information concerning their surgery, how to handle symptoms and problems at home, someone to contact after discharge and prognostic information about their future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients reported most received information in areas of medical tests and disease but less on other services and support in outpatient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The variation in INFO25 was best explained by gender (P = 0.045) and preoperative health status (American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3, P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results from this study indicate that women and patients with a poorer preoperative health status scored less on information received and would need more time and support to prepare for discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients expressed a desire for more information about the surgery, how to handle symptoms at home and prognostic information about their future </plain></SENT>
