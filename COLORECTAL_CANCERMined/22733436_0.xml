<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based case-control study which included 394 cases and 393 cancer-free controls was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 19 tagSNPs in the three genes were chosen based on HapMap and NCBI datasets and genotyped by SNPshot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression models were applied to evaluate the associations of SNPs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> after adjustment for potential covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method was used to test the interactive effect among three genes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with those carrying rs3755457 CC/CT or rs12477554 TT/CT genotype, individuals carrying homozygous variants had higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (adjusted OR = 1.80, 95 % CI = 1.03-3.13, P = 0.039 for rs3755457; adjusted OR = 1.73, 95 % CI = 1.07-2.79, P = 0.024 for rs12477554) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for rs10198644, GG genotype was associated with a 1.72-fold (95 % CI = 0.37-0.88) decreased risk when compared with the common CC genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the GMDR analysis indicated that the best interactive model included five polymorphisms: rs2072100 (TAC1), rs10198644 (TACR1), rs2193409 (TACR1), rs3771810 (TACR1), and rs4644560 (TACR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that tachykinins pathway genes may participate in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the potential interactions among the three genes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may exist, which has to be confirmed in future larger studies </plain></SENT>
