<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The combined treatment of cytoreductive surgery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) and perioperative chemotherapy (PIC) for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) is a rigorous surgical treatment most suited for fit and young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With technical maturity and improved perioperative care, we examined the outcomes of elderly patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and PIC for colorectal PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients treated in two tertiary centers for PC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who were 70 years of age or older at the time of surgery were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on patient characteristics, concomitant diseases, operation details, perioperative course, and follow-up were retrieved from medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were perioperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were disease-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (11 male) were included in this study (mean age 73.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eight patients major complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In six patients the postoperative course was complicated by minor adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 35 months with a 6, 12, and 18 months survival rate of 94%, 83%, and 68%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and PIC for colorectal PC may be safely performed with acceptable morbidity in selected elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When considering patients for surgery, performance status, and the disease extent should be used as eligibility criteria rather than age </plain></SENT>
