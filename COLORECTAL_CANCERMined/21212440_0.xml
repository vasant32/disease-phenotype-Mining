<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Some aspects of the natural history of metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (MCRC), such as the rate of progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> to MCRC, are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to estimate a set of parameters revealing some of these unknown characteristics of MCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors developed a computer simulation model that mimics the progression of MCRC for a 5-year period following the treatment of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They obtained the inputs of the simulation model using longitudinal data for 284 CRC patients from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five-year MCRC incidence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were 7.4% and 12.7% in the patient cohort, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed that 5-year MCRC incidence was associated with gender (P = 0.05), whereas both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related mortalities were associated with age (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimated annual probabilities of progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> to MCRC and from MCRC to metastatic MCRC were 0.14 and 0.28, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Annual probabilities of mortality after MCRC and metastatic MCRC treatments were estimated to be 0.06 and 0.26, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated annual probability of mortality due to undetected MCRC was 0.16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that MCRC, especially in women, may be more common than suggested by previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, statistics derived from the clinical data and results of the simulation model indicate that gender and age affect the progression of MCRC </plain></SENT>
