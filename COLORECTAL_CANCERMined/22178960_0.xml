<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: With the widespread use of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, an increasing number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> are diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An optimal algorithm for management has not been fully defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accumulating data suggest an association with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY: Patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at our institute from 1986 until 2008 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (28 men, 52%) were diagnosed with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> at a median age of 59 years (range, 27 to 84 y); 33 patients (61%) underwent endoscopic or surgical intervention, 5 (9%) were only followed endoscopically, and 16 (30%) underwent no intervention or follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete endoscopic removal was accomplished in at least 81% of cases, and no complications were reported; surgical intervention was complicated in 4 patients, with 1 resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence was 20% at a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 4 to 54 mo), but no <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were found in 16 of 29 patients (55%) who underwent colonoscopy, including 2 cancers (7%), 7 advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (24%), and 7 nonadvanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although no consistent approach to management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was followed, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0006771'>duodenal carcinoma</z:hpo> developed during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic intervention is preferred over surgical intervention, whenever possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Once complete removal is ascertained, there is no strict indication for regular follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy, especially in elderly patients or patients with relevant comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic assessment is warranted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
