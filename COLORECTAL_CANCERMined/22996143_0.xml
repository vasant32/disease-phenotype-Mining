<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Published results addressing the treatment of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) vary widely with local recurrence rates of 2-40% and 5-year survival of 14-55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to analyze our 10-year experience with laparoscopic RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2000 to July 2010, 130 patients underwent laparoscopic RFA for CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify factors associated with survival and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this cohort, median survival was 40.4 months with 5-year survival of 28.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 9.2% of patients had a local recurrence (3.6% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> 3 cm or less) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, factors associated with decreased survival were BMI (P = 0.045), rectal primary (P = 0.005), and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (HR 1.29 [95% CI: 1.04-1.59]; P = 0.020) and bilobar disease (HR 2.06 [95% CI: 1.02-4.15]; P = 0.044) were associated with decreased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, only BMI was found to be associated with disease recurrence (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that laparoscopic RFA can achieve a median survival of 40.4 months with a low local recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> 3 cm or less have a decreased risk of local recurrence </plain></SENT>
