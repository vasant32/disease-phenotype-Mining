<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the potential use of anti-RPH3AL autoantibodies as a marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from 84 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 63 healthy controls were analysed for the presence of RPH3AL autoantibodies with a Western blotting assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of RPH3AL autoantibodies in the early stage, advanced stage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were 64.7%, 78.0% and 72.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These values are significantly higher than the frequency of RPH3AL autoantibodies in healthy controls (15.9%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of RPH3AL autoantibodies did not correlate with clinical parameters, RPH3AL autoantibodies were found in 69.4% (34/49) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who were negative for carcinoembryonic antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of RPH3AL autoantibody was 0.84, which suggests that screening for these autoantibodies could potentially be used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Circulating RPH3AL autoantibodies are prevalent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and detection of these autoantibodies might provide a novel non-invasive approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
