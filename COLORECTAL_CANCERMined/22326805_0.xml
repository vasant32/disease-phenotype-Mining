<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interest in these inhibitors arose from their properties against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemically induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the effect of two BBI preparations (from Glycine max and Macrotyloma axillare) were evaluated for the prevention of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> induced by intraperitoneal injections of DMH, given at a dose of 30 mg/kg, during 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice treated with DMH presented histopathological alterations consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development, augmented CD44 expression and increased proteasome peptidase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lysosomal fractions, obtained from the intestines, were chromatographed in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi>-BBI column and increased activity for trypsin and chymotrypsin-like proteases recovered from DMH-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In parallel, mice treated for eight weeks with BBIs showed a decrease in the chymotrypsin and trypsin-like proteasome activities compared to animals fed on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the groups receiving simultaneous treatment with DMH and BBIs, dysplasic lesions were not observed and proteasome peptidase activities were similar to the control group after the 24th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the mechanism by which BBIs could prevent the appearance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_481'>pre neoplastic lesions</z:mpath> is associated with inhibition of both the lysosomal and proteasome-dependent proteolytic pathways </plain></SENT>
