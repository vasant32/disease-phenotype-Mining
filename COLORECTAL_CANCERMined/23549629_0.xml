<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An overview of recently published data is provided using selected articles from the literature and our own clinical experience in an interdisciplinary liver centre.Results: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA) and laser ablation (LITT) show comparable results concerning survival data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence is less frequent after LITT (7,1-10 %) than after RFA (32-44 %) and MWA (7-15 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival depends on many factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rate for RFA ranges from 20,2-71,3 %, for MWA it is 51,1 % and for LITT from 56-77 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean complication rates range from 1,8-10 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent studies showed promising results after combined therapy of regional chemotherapy or regional radiotherapy with thermal ablation.Conclusion: Ablation methods such as RFA, MWA and LITT show good local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control with low complication rates and are usually performed on an outpatient basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indications are &lt; 5 metastases limited to the liver with a maximum diameter of â‰¤ 4 cm when surgical resection is contraindicated or has been previously performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decision should be made by an interdisciplinary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> board </plain></SENT>
