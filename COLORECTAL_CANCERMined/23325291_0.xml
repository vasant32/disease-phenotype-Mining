<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the utility of several functional imaging modalities to assess the efficacy of bevacizumab beyond progression (BBP) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LS174T xenografts were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and bevacizumab combination therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increase of 1.5 times the initial volume on two subsequent measurements, was considered progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In half of the mice bevacizumab treatment was continued (n = 13) after progressive disease was established, while the others received saline injections (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within 3 days after progression, multi-modal imaging was performed using FDG-PET, diffusion weighted imaging, T2* and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurements were repeated 7 and 10 days after the first measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were analyzed for expression of carbonic anhydrase IX, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 1, 9 F1 to stain the vasculature and Ki67 to assess proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the BBP group <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> after progression was reduced compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
