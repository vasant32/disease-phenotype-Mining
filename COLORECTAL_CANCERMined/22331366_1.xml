<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (HHT) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder most often caused by mutation in the endoglin or ALK1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A distinct syndrome combines the clinical features of HHT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0345893" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="JPS|JIP|PJI">juvenile polyposis</z:e> (JP) and has been associated with SMAD4 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the phenotype of patients with JP-HHT and SMAD4 mutations and to compare this phenotype with HHT or JP patients with mutations other than SMAD4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients prospectively enrolled in the Toronto HHT and JP databases who underwent genotyping were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic characteristics of JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutations and patients with mutations other than SMAD4 were analyzed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent genetic testing (HHT, n = 332; JP, n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among fourteen patients identified with SMAD4 mutations, ten met the clinical diagnostic criteria for both JP and HHT (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with SMAD4 mutations had 100% penetrance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with JP and SMAD4 mutation had features of HHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three JP-HHT patients developed early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) (mean age 28 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutation had a significantly higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> than HHT patients with mutations other than SMAD4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HHT and SMAD4 mutations are at significant risk of JP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The gastrointestinal phenotype is similar to JP patients without SMAD4 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is essential for HHT patients to undergo genetic testing to determine if they have SMAD4 mutations so that appropriate gastrointestinal screening and surveillance for JP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> can be completed </plain></SENT>
