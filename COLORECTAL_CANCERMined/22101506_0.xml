<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the age-specific pattern of administration of chemotherapy and its association with long-term survival and quality of life (QoL) in stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chemotherapy allocation according to disease and patient characteristics was investigated in a population-based cohort of 562 stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five years after diagnosis, survival was determined and QoL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 Items and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association among chemotherapy, survival, and QoL was examined while controlling for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chemotherapy was administered in 71% of patients aged &lt;60 years and in only 20% of patients aged ≥80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant association between chemotherapy and longer survival time was found for stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was associated with higher symptom levels for trouble with taste, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>hair loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In age-specific analyses, younger survivors (&lt;70 years at time of follow-up) with a history of chemotherapy reported significantly lower physical, role, and cognitive functioning and higher pain, appetite loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>hair loss</z:hpo>, and trouble with taste symptom levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for older survivors (≥70 years), only two (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>hair loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000217'>dry mouth</z:hpo>) out of 38 QoL scores were significantly associated with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Chemotherapy is associated with lower long-term QoL, especially in younger survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases of uncertain survival benefits of chemotherapy, consideration of its long-term effects on QoL should be incorporated into final decisions on treatment </plain></SENT>
