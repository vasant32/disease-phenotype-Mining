<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the procedure requires a high level of skill and the procedure has yet to be standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the present time, colorectal ESD is only permitted in Japanese institutions that have been certified for advanced medical treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 200 cases of colorectal ESD that were performed in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over time, it was found that there was a continuous improvement in the treatment outcomes along with advances in both the procedures and the peripheral equipment utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Current results suggest that the colorectal ESD procedure is relatively stable </plain></SENT>
