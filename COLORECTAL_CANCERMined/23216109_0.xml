<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reported that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi> is a good antimutagen and anticarcinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are also some contradicting findings showing that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi> was a comutagen and cocarcinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi> is an anticarcinogen or a cocarcinogen in rats induced with azoxymethane (AOM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats induced with AOM will develop <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AOM-challenged rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi> orally and intraperitoneally at low and high concentrations and ACF density, multiplicity, and distribution were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of 14 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi> consumed orally had no effect on ACF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, high concentrations (300 mg/kg body weight) of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi> administered through intraperitoneal injection could increase ACF density and ACF multiplicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ACF were mainly found in the distal colon rather than in the mid-section and proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> biomarkers, protooncogenes, recombinational repair, mismatch repair, and cell cycle arrest, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene expression were also affected by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">Vanillin</z:chebi> was not cocarcinogenic when consumed orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it was cocarcinogenic when being administered intraperitoneally at high concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hence, the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi> in food should be safe but might have cocarcinogenic potential when it is used in high concentration for therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
