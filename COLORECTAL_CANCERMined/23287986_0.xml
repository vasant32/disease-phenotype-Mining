<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circadian disruption has been implicated in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in experimental studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively examined the association between sleep duration and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, 75 828 postmenopausal women reported habitual sleep duration at baseline 1993-1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We ascertained 851 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> through 2010, with an average 11.3 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with 7 h of sleep, the HRs were 1.36 (95% CI 1.06-1.74) and 1.47 (95% CI 1.10-1.96) for short (≤5 h) and long (≥9 h) sleep duration, respectively, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), physical activity, and waist to hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association was modified by the use of HRT (P-interaction=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both extreme short and long sleep durations were associated with a moderate increase in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sleep duration may be a novel, independent, and potentially modifiable risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
