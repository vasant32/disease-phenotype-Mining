<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quality of life (QoL) was assessed, and associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response and survival were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> QoL questionnaire-core 30 was used, focusing on global health status (GHS)/QoL and social functioning scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiological response was assessed by an independent review committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QoL was evaluable in 627/666 patients (94%) with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>; of these 52% received FOLFIRI, and 48% FOLFIRI plus cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pattern mixture analysis revealed no significant differences for GHS/QoL (P=0.12) and social functioning scores (P=0.43) between the treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In additional analyses: early skin reactions in patients receiving cetuximab did not significantly affect these QoL scales, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response was more common (58% versus 40%, P=0.0002) and survival longer (Hazard ratio 1.68, P&lt;0.0001) in asymptomatic compared with symptomatic patients at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adding cetuximab to FOLFIRI was associated with significantly higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response irrespective of patient baseline symptomatic status, and enhanced symptom relief from baseline in those whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> had responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adding cetuximab to FOLFIRI improved response rate and survival without either improving or negatively impacting on GHS/QoL and social functioning </plain></SENT>
