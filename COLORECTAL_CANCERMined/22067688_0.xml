<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, findings from previous studies indicate that the relationships between self-efficacy and several variables are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the level of self-care self-efficacy among Chinese gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and to identify the demographic and disease-related, physical, psychological, and social factors associated with their self-care self-efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred forty-eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were recruited from hospitals in Shanghai and Shandong Province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their self-efficacy, health status, social support, and mental health were assessed during face-to-face interview, using the Strategies Used by People to Promote Health (Chinese version), Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36, Social Support Questionnaire, and the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall level of self-care self-efficacy was moderate (mean, 80.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multiple regression analyses indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, physical functioning, use of available social support, vitality, and profession were indicators of the level of self-care self-efficacy and accounted for 60.9% of the variances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Participants who had less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, better physical function, more social support, and higher vitality tended to have higher levels of self-care self-efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> levels had the largest influence on self-care self-efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Findings indicate that nurses may be able to influence certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients' self-care self-efficacy by attending to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and other variables related to physical and social functioning </plain></SENT>
