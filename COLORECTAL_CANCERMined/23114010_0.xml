<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Method A cohort study of 299 912 participants aged 30-100 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, rates of health-care utilization and costs were evaluated in relation to diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-standardized prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was 7% in men and 14% in women with no morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> increased in single morbidities including DM (men 13%, women 22%), CHD (men 15%, women 24%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (men 14%, women 26%) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (men 10%, women 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants with concurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, CHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a very high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (men 23%, women 49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> for one morbidity was 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-1.66], two morbidities 1.96 (95% CI 1.89-2.03) and three morbidities 2.35 (95% CI 2.03-2.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to those with no morbidity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was associated with higher rates of health-care utilization and increased costs at any level of morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women aged 55 to 64 years without morbidity, the mean annual health-care cost was £513 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and £1074 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>; when three morbidities were present, the cost was £1495 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and £2878 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> prevalence and health-care costs are more strongly associated with the number of morbidities than the nature of the co-morbid diagnosis </plain></SENT>
