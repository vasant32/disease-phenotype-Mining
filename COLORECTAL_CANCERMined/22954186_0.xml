<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was generated in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, which were then randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> versus vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MMP activity was measured by an enzyme-activatable optical molecular probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was also used to assess <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>'s effect on MMP activity, which was measured by quantitative fluorescence colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneously implanted xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were 84% (SD 20.2%) smaller in volume in the treatment group versus the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treated animals exhibited only a 7.6% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 9%) increase in MMP activity versus 106% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 8%) for untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an apparent linear relationship (r  =  .91) between measured MMP activity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, in the GEM model experiment, treated murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> remained relatively unchanged in volume and MMP activity; however, untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> grew significantly and showed an increase in MMP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This method may provide for the improved identification of patients for whom COX-2 inhibition therapy is indicated by allowing one to balance the patient's cardiovascular risk with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>'s responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
