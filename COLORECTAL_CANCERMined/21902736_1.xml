<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies, however, have examined the correlates of PA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the Alberta <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, 2000 randomly selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors were mailed a self-reported questionnaire assessing medical, demographic, behavioural and social cognitive variables from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 600 survivors who responded, 33% were meeting public health PA guidelines and almost half were completely sedentary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher PA was reported by survivors who were younger, unmarried, better educated, wealthier, employed, non-smokers, social drinkers, not treated with radiation therapy, disease-free, in better health and less comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate path analysis, these variables were not directly associated with PA after controlling for the TPB variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TPB explained 34% (P &lt; 0.001) of the variance in PA behaviour with direct associations for intention (β= 0.22; P= 0.015) and planning (β= 0.18; P= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intention, in turn, had 62% (P &lt; 0.001) of its variance explained by perceived behavioural control (β= 0.43; P &lt; 0.001), affective attitude (β= 0.25; P &lt; 0.001) and instrumental attitude (β= 0.15; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TPB may be a useful framework for developing population-based interventions to increase PA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
