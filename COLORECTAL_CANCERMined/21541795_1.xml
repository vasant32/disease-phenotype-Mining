<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is the second most commonly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> among Hispanics in the United States (US), yet the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is low in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physician recommendation has consistently shown to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the characteristics of Hispanic patients who adhere or do not adhere to their physician's recommendation to have a screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cross-sectional study featuring face-to-face interviews by culturally matched interviewers was conducted in primary healthcare clinics and community centers in New York City </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred Hispanic men and women aged 50 or older, at average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and eighty (70%) reported receipt of a physician's recommendation for screening colonoscopy and are included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN MEASURES: Dependent variable: self report of having had screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independent variables: sociodemographics, healthcare and health promotion factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Of the 280 participants, 25% did not adhere to their physician's recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors found to be associated with non-adherence were younger age, being born in the US, preference for completing interviews in English, higher acculturation, and greater reported fear of colonoscopy testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The source of colonoscopy recommendation (whether it came from their usual healthcare provider or not, and whether it occurred in a community or academic healthcare facility) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was not associated with adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that potentially identifiable subgroups of Hispanics may be less likely to follow their physician recommendation to have a screening colonoscopy and thus may decrease their likelihood of an early diagnosis and prompt treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Raising physicians' awareness to such patients' characteristics could help them anticipate patients who may be less adherent and who may need additional encouragement to undergo screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
