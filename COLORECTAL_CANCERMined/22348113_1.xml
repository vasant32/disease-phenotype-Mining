<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recurrences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> after curative resection are sometimes unavoidable and often take place within the first year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs may serve as biomarkers to predict early recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but identifying them from over 1,400 known human microRNAs is challenging and costly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An alternative approach is to analyze existing expression data of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>) because generally speaking the expression levels of microRNAs and their target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> are inversely correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we extracted six <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression data of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in four studies (GSE12032, GSE17538, GSE4526 and GSE17181) from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We inferred microRNA expression profiles and performed computational analysis to identify microRNAs associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence using the IMRE method based on the MicroCosm database that includes 568,071 microRNA-target connections between 711 microRNAs and 20,884 gene targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two microRNAs, miR-29a and miR-29c, were disclosed and further meta-analysis of the six <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression datasets showed that these two microRNAs were highly significant based on the Fisher p-value combination (p = 9.14 × 10(-9) for miR-29a and p = 1.14 × 10(-6) for miR-29c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these two microRNAs were experimentally tested in 78 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples to validate their effect on early recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our empirical results showed that the two microRNAs were significantly down-regulated (p = 0.007 for miR-29a and p = 0.007 for miR-29c) in the early-recurrence patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study shows the feasibility of using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> profiles to indicate microRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also shows miR-29a/c could be potential biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> early recurrence </plain></SENT>
