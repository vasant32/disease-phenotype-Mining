<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence and severity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-associated neurotoxicity in clinical practice and the clinical management of this adverse side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Observational retrospective study including patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> that started an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy regimen during 2008 at a secondary hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from an onco-haematological prescription programme at the hospital and from digital clinical histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compiled variables related to the clinical characteristics of the patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> treatment, neurotoxicity associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and clinical management of this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study included a total of 64 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxicity was recorded in 65.6% of cases, usually in mild or moderate forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In approximately one third of patients who developed this adverse effect, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> prescription had to be modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed a statistically significant relationship between cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> doses and the presence of neurological toxicity (P=.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-associated neurotoxicity and its distribution based on its severity was similar to rates published in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of patients requiring a change in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> prescription could justify the need for studies that assess the clinical consequences of these modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that effective strategies for neurological protection need to be developed in order to guarantee the safety and quality of life in these patients </plain></SENT>
