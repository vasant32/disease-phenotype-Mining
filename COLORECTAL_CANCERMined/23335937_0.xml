<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most prominent loss-of-function allele of the DPYD gene is the splice-site mutation c.1905+1G&gt;A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we report the case of a 73-year old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who died from drug-induced toxicity after the first cycle of 5-FU-containing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her symptoms included severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, mucositis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>; she died 16 days later despite intensive care measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem genetic analysis revealed that the patient was homozygous for the c.1905+1G&gt;A deleterious allele and several family members consented to being screened for this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first report in Spain of a case of 5-FU-induced lethal toxicity associated with a genetic defect that results in the complete loss of the DPD enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the frequency of c.1905+1G&gt;A carriers in the white population ranges between 1 and 2%, the few data available for the Spanish population and the severity of this case prompted us to design a genotyping procedure to prevent future toxic effects of 5-FU/CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since our group had previously developed a high-resolution melting (HRM) assay for the simultaneous detection of KRAS, BRAF, and/or EGFR <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> patients considered for EGFR-targeted therapies, we included the DPYD c.1905+1G&gt;A mutation in the screening test that we describe herein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HRM provides a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive method that can be easily implemented in diagnostic settings for the routine pre-therapeutic testing of a gene mutation panel with implications in the pharmacologic treatment </plain></SENT>
