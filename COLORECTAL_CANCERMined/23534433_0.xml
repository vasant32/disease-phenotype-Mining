<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> has been related to adverse outcomes after surgical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>How various factors may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and also its post-operative recovery has not been extensively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods.Two hundred and thirty five <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients treated surgically in a community teaching hospital in Norway between 2007 and 2009 were prospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> was detected in 53.8%, which was dependent on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, albumin level and female gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 60% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative BMI was negatively associated with age and positively associated with albumin level (p = 0.018 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">Haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels slowly returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> during the first year in significant incremental steps, coincidental with an increase in BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 6 months post-operative, age, albumin, female gender and TNM stage (p = 0.010; p = 0.020; p &lt; 0.001; p = 0.028, respectively) were significantly connected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, whereas only age and albumin (p = 0.016; p = 0.004, respectively) were associated with a <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>reduced BMI</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> gave a significantly worse overall survival (p = 0.040) in the univariate analysis but was not significant in the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion.Beside the influence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, it appeared that pre-operative Hgb had some relation to a reduced nutritional state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The post-operative recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was more closely related to an improved nutritional state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and oncological outcome should undergo further studies </plain></SENT>
