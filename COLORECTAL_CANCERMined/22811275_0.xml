<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has evolved rapidly over the last decade, with combination chemotherapy and targeted biologic agents leading to significant improvements in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite these advances, little is known about their effectiveness in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-associated PC treated in the era of modern chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed an institutional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> database from 1996 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival data were evaluated for patients treated with PC before and after 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patients before 2003 were treated with combination chemotherapy or biologic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The modern chemotherapy group consisted of patients treated after 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 173 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 8.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median survival in the historic group (n = 91) was 8.9 months and 16.3 months in the modern chemotherapy group (n = 82) (P &lt; 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age was the only significant covariate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The survival difference between the modern chemotherapy cohort and control cohort persisted after adjustment for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In a subset of patients in the modern chemotherapy era group, for which treatment regimen could be definitively identified, survival was even greater-23.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-associated PC treated with modern combination chemotherapy and biologic therapy have a significantly longer median survival compared to our historical cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite these improvements, outcomes still remain poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic adjuncts such as surgical cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in appropriately selected patients remain promising options to improve outcomes for patients with peritoneal-based disease </plain></SENT>
