<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening rates are low in New Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used statewide surveys of primary care physicians and the general population to characterize <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening practices and compare perceptions about screening barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2006, we surveyed 714 primary care physicians in New Mexico about their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening practices, beliefs, and perceptions of patient, provider, and system barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 2004 state-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening module for the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey asked 3,355 participants aged 50 years or older why they had not ever or had not recently completed a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or lower endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 216 physicians (30% response rate) reported offering screening to a median 80% of their average-risk patients in the past year and estimated that a median 50% were current with screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They attributed low screening proportions mainly to patient factors (embarrassment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233702" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of pain</z:e>, lack of insurance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, just 51% of physician respondents used health maintenance flow sheets, and only 13% used electronic medical records to identify patients due for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BRFSS respondents most often reported that lack of physician discussion was responsible for not being current with screening (45% FOBT, 34% endoscopy); being asymptomatic was also often cited as an explanation for lack of screening (22% FOBT, 36% endoscopy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Physicians and adults in the general population had markedly different perspectives on barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing screening may require system supports to help physicians readily identify patients due for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing and interventions to educate patients about the rationale for screening </plain></SENT>
