<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the role of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in the treatment of nonsurgical cystic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastasis</z:e>, and to determine predictors of response to GKRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively maintained database of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> patients treated at our institution between 2006 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions with a cystic component were identified, and volumetric analysis was done to measure percentage of cystic volume on day of treatment and consecutive follow-up MRI scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical, radiologic, and dosimetry parameters were reviewed to establish the overall response of cystic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> to GKRS as well as identify potential predictive factors of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 111 lesions in 73 patients were analyzed; 57% of lesions received prior whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>Lung carcinoma</z:mp> was the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in 51% of patients, 10% breast, 10% colorectal, 4% <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, and 26% other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven percent of the patients were recursive partitioning analysis class 1, the remainder class 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean target volume was 3.3 mL (range, 0.1-23 mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median prescription dose was 21 Gy (range, 15-24 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Local control rates were 91%, 63%, and 37% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Local control was improved in lung primary and worse in patients with prior WBRT (univariate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only lung primary predicted local control in multivariate analysis, whereas age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lesions with a large cystic component did not show a poorer response compared with those with a small cystic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of GKRS in the management of nonsurgical cystic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, despite a traditionally perceived poorer response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our local control rates are comparable to a matched cohort of noncystic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e>, and therefore the presence of a large cystic component should not deter the use of GKRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Predictors of response included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Prior WBRT decreased effectiveness of SRS for local control rates </plain></SENT>
