<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to inhibit the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in preclinical models but data are conflicting and whether it can protect against gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in vivo has not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the effect of RA on the development of intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in the Apc(Min) mouse model of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, and to correlate efficacy with levels of RA achieved in the plasma and gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: RA inhibited the growth of APC10.1 cells derived from Apc(Min) mouse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, with an IC₅₀ of 43 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consumption of dietary RA (0.3%) by Apc(Min) mice for 8 weeks post weaning decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> burden by ∼35%, but the difference from controls was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although RA significantly decreased the frequency of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, the number of small ones increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a novel validated HPLC assay, average levels of RA in the plasma and intestinal mucosa of these mice were found to be 1.1 μM and 38 nmol/g, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> consumption of RA furnished quantifiable levels of parent compound in the plasma and intestinal tract of Apc(Min) mice and may slow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
