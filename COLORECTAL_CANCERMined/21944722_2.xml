<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50825">Gold nanoparticles</z:chebi> with 50%<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-NH(2)/50% <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> are taken up eighteen fold faster than nanoparticles carrying only <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-NH(2) or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi>-coated gold particles are by far the most efficiently internalized; however, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> dual-ligand nanoparticles are taken up at a thirty fold reduced rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found furthermore that the rates are influenced by the cell density and concentration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the growth medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rather than being internalized through a conventional receptor-mediated mechanism the particles appear to be taken up by the cells via an energy-independent diffusion across the cell membrane through pre-existing pores or openings in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bi-layer created by ligands on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50825">gold nanoparticles</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
