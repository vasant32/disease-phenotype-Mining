<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate patterns in the relapse frequency after curative surgical intervention, with the intention of determining the feasibility of a complete holiday from chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with stage IV mCRC who received curative surgical intervention between January 1999 and December 2009 at Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan were investigated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing the frequency and pattern of relapse were analyzed by logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing overall survival (OS) were analyzed with Cox proportional hazard ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant factors were extracted and relationships to OS were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier with Log-Rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two patients were included in the study in which 94 (71.2%) suffered from relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of relapses peaked between 3 and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of relapse and Disease-free survival had a negative influence on OS, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.01-0.26) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was significantly worse when the relapse (n=25) occurred within 6 months after metastectomy (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients exhibited significantly better long-term OS if the relapse does not occur within 28 months after surgery (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early relapse indicated a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We determined that if mCRC patients remain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free for 28 months after curative surgery, their chance of long-term survival is significantly better </plain></SENT>
