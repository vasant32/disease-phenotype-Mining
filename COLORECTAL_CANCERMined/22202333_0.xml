<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with synchronous unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and compared the prognosis between before and after the administration of mFOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subject was 28 patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with synchronous unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> who received mFOLFOX6 as a first-line treatment from 2005 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median frequency of mFOLFOX6 was 10 times( range, 2-24 times), relative dose intensity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was 75.0% (range, 42 .9-100), response rate was 32%, and median progression-free survival was 9  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> was performed to 4 patients (14.3%) as a conversion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of the patients with mFOLFOX6 was significantly better than that of 31 patients who received the chemotherapy via hepatic artery or the chemotherapy before the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (31.8 months vs. 15 .1 months, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
