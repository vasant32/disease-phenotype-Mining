<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anticancer activity of RA-incorporated DexDA nanoparticles were tested in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: RA-incorporated nanoparticles were prepared by dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antiproliferative and anti-invasive potential of RA-incorporated nanoparticles were studied using CT26 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RA-incorporated nanoparticles have small particle sizes of around 70-300 nm and spherical shapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The higher drug-feeding ratio and higher substitution degree of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> in the conjugates resulted in higher drug contents, lower loading efficiency, and larger particle size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RA release rate became slower at higher drug contents and higher substitution degree of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> in the DexDA conjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferation activity, anti-invasive activity, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 expression of RA-incorporated nanoparticles against CT26 cells in vitro was similar to RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, RA-incorporated nanoparticles had superior antimetastatic activity in an animal pulmonary metastatic model of CT26 cells compared to RA itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RA-incorporated nanoparticles showed similar anticancer activity in vitro and superior antimetastatic activity in vivo in a pulmonary metastatic model of CT26 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that RA-incorporated nanoparticles are promising vehicles for efficient delivery of RA </plain></SENT>
