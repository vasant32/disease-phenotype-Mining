<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">Cytochrome P450</z:chebi> 2W1 (CYP2W1) is found in fetal colon tissue and is also detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> but not in non-transformed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a pilot study, we reported that the immunohistochemically-detected expression of CYP2W1 might be of prognostic value since high expression of CYP2W1 was indicative of a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to validate the pilot study's results using a larger, independent group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical detection of CYP2W1 in 235 malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> of stage II and III, was carried out using a polyclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grading of staining was carried out by two independent readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest grade that involved more than 5% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> area on each slide was used for the classification of CYP2W1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CYP2W1 was expressed at high levels in 30% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the entire <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> group it was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (p=0.04), where high expression (grade 3) correlated with worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CYP2W1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in the subgroup of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> stage III (p=0.003), but not for those with stage II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 107 cases, two slices from different areas of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were available, and no significant difference in CYP2W1 expression between the slices was observed (r=0.53, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of the current study were in agreement with those of the previous pilot study and show that higher expression of CYP2W1 seems to be of prognostic value in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found equal expression in slices from two different areas of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since the CYP2W1 enzyme has been shown to catalytically activate compounds to cytotoxic products, the enzyme might be used as a novel drug target for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
