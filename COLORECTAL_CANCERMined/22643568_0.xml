<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated if there is any difference between first-line irinotecan-based and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapies in the duration of time to disease progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> referred to the Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Department at the Faculty of Medicine of Ege University, between January 2002 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients had only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> and completed their first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based treatments while 12 also had bevacizumab therapy, and 35 patients had irinotecan-based treatments while 16 also had bevacizumab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was 6.70±0.29 months for patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>+5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 8.33±1.15 months for patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>+5-FU+bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was significantly improved for patients who received irinotecan+5-FU+bevacizumab (median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, 13.73±2.10 mo) when compared with irinotecan+5-FU (median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, 5.13±0.70 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Although previous studies showed no survival difference between these 2 chemotherapeutic agents in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, there might be differences in the benefit of delaying the disease progression in subgroup populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan+5-FU with bevacizumab combination chemotherapy may be superior in the first-line treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with hepatic only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
