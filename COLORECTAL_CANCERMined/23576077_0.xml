<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pretreatment serum SCCAg measurements in patients with histologically diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the anal canal and margin who received <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> were compared with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> classification and lymph node status for prognostic/predictive ability, including 1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response after the completion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> treatment, 2) disease recurrence, and 3) overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical measurements and scores were compared using Spearman rank tests, and survival was assessed in both univariate and multivariate survival analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median pretreatment levels of SCCAg according to clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> classification and clinical lymph node status were 0.8 μg/L in T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 1.90 μg/L in T2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 2.5 μg/L in T3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 3.8 μg/L in T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 1.35 μg/L in patients with N0 status, and 3.05 μg/L in patients with N0+ status (correlation coefficient: T-classification, 0.43; lymph node status, 0.38; both P &lt; .00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SCCAg levels, 95% achieved a complete response after initial treatment; and, of those who had elevated SCCAg levels, 86% achieved a complete response (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.5; P = .007) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.2; P = .058) were worse for those who had elevated pretreatment serum SCCAg concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment SCCAg levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the anal canal and margin were correlated with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> classification and clinical lymph node status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of SCCAg were associated with a reduced chance of achieving a complete response and an increased chance of recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors recommend further studies to determine the prognostic value of SCCAg in anal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and suggest the potential use of SCCAg as a stratification factor in future trials </plain></SENT>
