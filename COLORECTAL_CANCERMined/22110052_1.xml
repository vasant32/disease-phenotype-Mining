<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies examining the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after polypectomy have provided discordant findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> removal in routine clinical practice with the risk in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cohort study based on detailed data from a population-based registry that has collected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> diagnosed in a clearly-defined population since 1976 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: French administrative area of CÃ´te-d'Or (Burgundy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Residents of the area diagnosed for the first time with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> between 1990 and 1999 were included (n=5779) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial and follow-up data until December 2003 were used to calculate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and cumulative probabilities after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 87 invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were diagnosed whereas 69 cases were expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the general population, the overall SIR was 1.26 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> depended on the characteristics of the initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (SIR 2.23 (95% CI 1.67 to 2.92) for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 0.68 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.99) for non-advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cases of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, the SIR was 1.10 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.82) in patients with colonoscopic follow-up and 4.26 (95% CI 2.89 to 6.04) in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 10-year cumulative probabilities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were, respectively, 2.05% (95% CI 1.14% to 3.64%) and 6.22% (95% CI 4.26% to 9.02%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In routine practice, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> removal remains high and depends both on initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> features and on colonoscopy surveillance practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gastroenterologists should encourage patients to comply with long-term colonoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
