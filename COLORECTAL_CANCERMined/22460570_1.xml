<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine whether there were differences in outcome between RFA and surgical resection in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 53 patients who underwent only hepatic resection or only RFA for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients who underwent hepatic resection were compared with 28 patients who underwent RFA for synchronous or metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median CEA level at the time of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> was significantly higher in the resection group (14.2 ng/mL vs. 2.8 ng/mL, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median size of main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> was significantly larger in the resection group (4.0 cm vs. 2.05 cm, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the percentage of patients experiencing major complication (one patient in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The marginal recurrence rate was significantly higher in the RFA group (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease-free and overall survival were longer in the resection group (p=0.008 and 0.017, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only the type of treatment was a factor associated with disease-free and overall survival (p=0.004 and 0.007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high marginal recurrence rate, RFA shows an inferior outcome in comparison with surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, RFA should be considered for only selected patients with unresectable (by any means) disease or with high operative risk </plain></SENT>
