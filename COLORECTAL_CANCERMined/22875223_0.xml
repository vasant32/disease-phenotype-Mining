<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lymph node ratio (LNR) has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abdominoperineal resection (APR) of rectum is historically associated with poorer oncological outcomes compared to other colorectal resections, and significance of LNR in this group of patients has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine impact of LNR on oncological outcomes in a series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> undergoing APR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of patients who had undergone APR and had lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were identified from a prospectively maintained clinical, histopathological and radiological database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LNR was calculated, and Cox regression was used to determine the impact of factors affecting local recurrence, distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-eight (42 males) patients were identified to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> with lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LNR was an independent predictor of distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and overall survival at cutoff levels of 0.17, 0.41 and 0.69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lymph node ratio is an independent predictor of survival outcomes in patients with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> undergoing APR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LNR may help improve stratification of this group of patients </plain></SENT>
