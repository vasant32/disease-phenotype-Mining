<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the effect of four VEGF (-460T/C, -634G/C, +936C/T, and -2578C/A) gene polymorphisms on the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we carried out a meta-analysis using published data to obtain more precise estimates of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electronic searches of PubMed and EMBASE were conducted to select studies for this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The principal outcome measure was the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> associated with four VEGF (-460T/C, -634G/C, +936C/T, and -2578C/A) gene polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 12 epidemiologic studies, which included 2770 CRC cases and 2568 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combined results based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases had a significantly higher frequency of VEGF -634GG (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.06, 1.44) and -2578AA (OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.12, 1.66) genotype and a lower frequency of -634CG (OR=0.82, 95% CI=0.71, 0.95) than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When stratifying for race, we found that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had a significantly higher frequency of -460TC (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.22, 1.94), -460CC (OR=2.00, 95% CI=1.50, 2.67), and -2578AA (OR=1.38, 95% CI=1.12, 1.69) and a lower frequency of -2578AA (OR=0.78, 95% CI=0.65, 0.93) genotypes of VEGF than controls, among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had a significantly higher frequency of -634GG (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.20, 2.15) and a lower frequency of -634CG (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.46, 0.79) genotypes of VEGF than controls, among Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that the VEGF -460T/C, -634G/C, and -2578C/A gene polymorphisms are associated with a risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
