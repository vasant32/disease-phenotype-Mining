<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complicated disease can be defined as the presence of bowel damage (stricture, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>) and/or the need for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Natural history studies provide invaluable data on the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In population-based cohorts, half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients experienced an intestinal complication within 20 years after diagnosis and half of the patients required surgery within 10 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Olmsted County, the factors associated with the development of complications were the presence of ileal involvement and perianal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of noncolonic disease, current smoking, male gender, penetrating disease behavior and early steroid use were significantly associated with major abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, using various definitions of complicated disease, the predictors of a worse outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were: extensive small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e>, severe upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rectal disease</z:e>, perianal lesions, early stricturing/penetrating disease, smoking and a young age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was recently defined as a disease that is associated with a high relapse rate, the need for surgery, the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> or the presence of extraintestinal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>About one tenth of patients still require colectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> at 5 years in the era of biologics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An average of 1.6% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during 14 years of follow-up in population-based cohorts </plain></SENT>
