<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chest computed tomography (CT) is often included in the preoperative staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of the nature of pulmonary lesions is not always easy and many question its clinical value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Clinical data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated at our institution for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have been collected prospectively in a dedicated database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since August 2008 chest CT has been routinely performed for preoperative staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome of 147 patients operated on since then (Group A) was compared with a numerically equal group of patients (147) (Group B) treated before the introduction of preoperative routine chest CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pulmonary lesions were identified in 45 (30%) patients in Group A and 10 (6.8%) in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten and nine lesions, respectively, were interpreted as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 28 (19%) patients in Group A, the lesions were considered to be indeterminate and only four were confirmed as malignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were present after 1 year of follow-up in 5 (50%) of 10 patients in Group A and 5 (55%) of 9 in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The global incidence of synchronous and metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was 6.8%, with no statistical difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that chest CT reveals a higher number of pulmonary lesions, only a small proportion of which were malignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The investigation does not add value to routine staging methods in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
