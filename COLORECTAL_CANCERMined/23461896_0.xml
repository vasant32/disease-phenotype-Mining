<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erosive oesophagitis</z:e> (EO) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As gluteofemoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, we hypothesised that gluteofemoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> would be inversely associated with EO and BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 822 male <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screenees who were recruited to also undergo upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional 80 patients with BO clinically detected by upper endoscopy referred for clinical indications were recruited shortly after their diagnoses of BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (waist circumference), gluteofemoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (hip circumference) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) on EO and BO (vs neither condition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 225 cases of either BO or EO and 675 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders, a positive association was observed between waist circumference and BO and/or EO, which became stronger with further adjustment for hip circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, hip circumference was inversely associated with BO and/or EO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the lowest quartile of WHR, the adjusted ORs were 1.32 (95% CI 0.747 to 2.33) for the 2nd quartile, 1.54 (95% CI 0.898 to 2.63) for the 3rd quartile, and 2.68 (95% CI 1.57 to 4.55) for the highest quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for BO and EO treated as separate outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a population of older, mostly overweight men, the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is associated with the presence of EO and BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> appears to increase the risk of these outcomes, whereas gluteofemoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may be protective </plain></SENT>
