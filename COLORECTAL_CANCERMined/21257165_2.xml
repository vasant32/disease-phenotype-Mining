<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data on the long-term outcomes of SEMSs are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of endoscopic stenting with those of surgery for palliation in patients with incurable obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGNS AND SETTING: A retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: From January 2000 to December 2008, patients with incurable obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who were treated with SEMSs (n = 71) or palliative surgery (n = 73) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: SEMS placement by using through-the-endoscope methods or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Success rates and complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early success rates in the SEMS group and those in the surgery group were not different (95.8% vs 100%, P = .12), and the SEMS group had fewer early complications than the surgery group (15.5% vs 32.9%, P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the patency duration of the first stent in the SEMS group was shorter than that in the surgery group (P &lt; .001), the median patency duration after a second stenting was comparable to that of the surgery group (P = .239) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were more late complications in the SEMS group than in the surgery group (P = .028), but the rates of major complications did not differ between the 2 groups (P = .074) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective and single-center study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SEMSs were not only an effective and acceptable therapy for initial palliation of malignant colorectal obstruction, but they also showed long-term efficacy comparable to that with surgery </plain></SENT>
