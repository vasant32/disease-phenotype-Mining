<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective audit explored the usefulness of a nurse-led telephone intervention for supporting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi>, comparing historical findings from a randomised trial evaluating a home-based intervention over standard care with a modified nurse-led telephone follow-up intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Self-reported toxicity and service use were assessed in 298 patients who received nurse-led telephone follow-up, compared with historical data from 164 patients (81 receiving standard care and 83 home care intervention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings suggested that nurse-led telephone follow-up can potentially lead to reduced toxicity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral mucositis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>) when compared with standard care, and that it has a similar impact on the management of some symptoms when compared with home care (i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral mucositis</z:e>), although it was not as effective as the home care intervention for other toxicities (diarrhoea and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These encouraging findings need to be explored further using a randomised trial design before we reach any conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further research should also include a health economics study to assess the cost-effectiveness of the telephone-based services for patients receiving oral chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
