<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physiopathology remains unclear and variability between patients suggests that there is individual susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> liver toxicity may allow the identification of biomarkers and adaptation of chemotherapy delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1998 and 2009, 83 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> frozen liver samples were obtained from patients operated on for CRLM after an exclusive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene-expression profiles were first analyzed by microarray on a selected population of 19 patients: 9 patients with severe sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> after a short period of chemotherapy and 10 patients without any sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> after a long period of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These were compared with a control group of 5 patients without any chemotherapy and lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two differentially-expressed (at least 1.5-fold difference in expression) genes were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were validated using microfluidic quantitative RT-PCR in an independent set of 58 patients (28 with sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and 30 without sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 22 selected genes, 12 were validated as being up-regulated in samples from patients with sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> compared to patients without sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> (VEGFD, THY-1, GPNMB) and cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (VWF, CDH13, THBS2), and extracellular matrix components (COL1A1, COL4A1, SLCO1A2) were over-represented in patients with sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This molecular signature confirms the involvement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and coagulation in sinusoidal injuries induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and reinforces a potential protective role of bevacizumab and aspirin, as suggested in retrospective clinical studies </plain></SENT>
