<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin (FU/LV) for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed the cost-effectiveness of FOLFOX compared with standard FU/LV treatment by the retrospective analysis of patient-level data from the randomized controlled Multicenter International Study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi>, and Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> (MOSAIC) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Predicted mean time spent in each disease state was calculated by our statistical model, which takes into account the cure rate and treats <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from causes other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> as a competing risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed this analysis from the perspective of the health-care payer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a time horizon of 30 years, both cost and effectiveness were discounted by 3% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Estimated cure rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> were 0.715 (FOLFOX) and 0.622 (FU/LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimated medical costs of FOLFOX were JPY 3.1 million (USD 34,000) compared with JPY 1.9 million (USD 22,000) of FU/LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean estimated quality-adjusted life-year was 9.83 with FOLFOX and 9.07 with that of FU/LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of FOLFOX was JPY 1.5 million (USD 17,000) per quality-adjusted life-year compared with FU/LV, which was supported by sensitivity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even if we assume that Japanese outcomes were better than those reported by the MOSAIC trial, which would reduce the difference between cure rates for each treatment to 5%, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained below 5.0 million (USD 56,000) per quality-adjusted life-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant FOLFOX is a cost-effective treatment for stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in Japan compared with FU/LV therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even when parameters were changed to reflect smaller improvements with FOLFOX, the conclusion is the same </plain></SENT>
