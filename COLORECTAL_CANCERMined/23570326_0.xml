<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Claudin-18, a component of tight junctions, correlates with poor survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and is associated with the gastric phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possible usefulness of these molecules in serrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of the colorectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed immunohistochemical analysis of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> (HP), sessile serrated lesions (SSL), traditional serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (TSA) and conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the association between expression of these molecules and clinicopathological parameters in serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (SAC) and non-SAC of the colorectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Olfactomedin 4 expression was not detected or was decreased in SSL compared with the other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Claudin-18 expression was higher in SSL than in the other types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, positivity for olfactomedin 4 in SAC was significantly lower than that in non-SAC, and positivity for claudin-18 in SAC was significantly higher than that in non-SAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, claudin-18-positive SAC showed more advanced N grade and stage than claudin-18-negative SAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced expression of olfactomedin 4 and ectopic expression of claudin-18 might be useful markers in the differential diagnosis of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
