<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous organizations have published guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening; however, these numerical estimates of incidence and disease-specific mortality have remained stable from years prior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Technological, genetic profiling, molecular and surgical advances in our modern era should allow us to improve risk stratification of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and identify those who may benefit from preventive measures, early aggressive treatment, alternative treatment strategies, and/or frequent surveillance for the early detection of disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better negotiate future economic constraints and enhance patient outcomes, ultimately, we propose to apply the principals of personalized and precise <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care to risk-stratify patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (Precision Risk Stratification-Based Screening, PRSBS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe that genetic, molecular, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities impact oncological outcomes in general, those related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, in particular </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to address how we could improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk stratification-based screening, and to provide a vision for the future to achieving superior survival rates for patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
