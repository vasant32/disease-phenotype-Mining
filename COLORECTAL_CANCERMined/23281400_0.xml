<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that dysbiosis caused by Nod2 deficiency gives rise to a reversible, communicable risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of either Nod2 or RIP2 resulted in a proinflammatory microenvironment that enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> following chemically induced injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The condition could be improved by treatment with antibiotics or an anti-interleukin-6 receptor-neutralizing antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype-dependent disease risk was communicable via maternally transmitted microbiota in both Nod2-deficient and WT hosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, reciprocal microbiota transplantation reduced disease risk in Nod2-deficient mice and led to long-term changes in intestinal microbial communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, disease risk was enhanced in WT hosts that were recolonized with dysbiotic fecal microbiota from Nod2-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, we demonstrated that licensing of dysbiotic microbiota is a critical component of disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that NOD2 has an unexpected role in shaping a protective assembly of gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> communities and suggest that manipulation of dysbiosis is a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
