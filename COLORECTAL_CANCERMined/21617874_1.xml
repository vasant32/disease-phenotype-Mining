<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological and animal studies indicate that regular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (aspirin) intake is associated with a reduction in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the toxicity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi>, the sensitivity of the DNA mismatch repair proficient SW480 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line to four categories of compounds with varying degrees of structural similarity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These compounds were: i) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16914">salicylic acid</z:chebi> analogues with substituents at the 5-position; ii) <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> analogues with extended chain lengths in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22221">acyl group</z:chebi>; iii) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18346">vanillin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18346">4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde</z:chebi>; and iv) bis(2-carboxyphenyl) succinate (BCS) and structurally similar derivatives thereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that compounds with amino and acetamido substituents at the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> 5-position were less toxic than <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> itself </plain></SENT>
