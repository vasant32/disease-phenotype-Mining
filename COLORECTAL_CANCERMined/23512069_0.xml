<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess predictors of low <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in Switzerland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective cohort of a random sample of 940 patients aged 50-80 years followed for 2 years from four Swiss University primary care settings was used </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We abstracted sociodemographic data of patients and physicians, patient health status, and indicators derived from RAND's Quality Assessment Tools from medical charts </plain></SENT>
