<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> (CIN) is typically studied using comparative-genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied paired (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and surrounding healthy) fresh frozen tissue from 86 CRC patients using Illumina's Infinium-based SNP array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method allowed us to study CIN in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, with simultaneous analysis of copy number <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> and B-allele frequency (BAF)--a representation of allelic composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data helped us to detect mono-allelic and bi-allelic amplifications/deletion, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, and levels of mosaicism for mixed cell populations, some of which can not be assessed with other methods that do not measure BAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified associations between CN abnormalities and different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> phenotypes (histological diagnosis, location, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade, stage, MSI and presence of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed commonalities between regions of CN change observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the regions reported in previous studies of other solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (e.g. amplifications of 20q, 13q, 8q, 5p and deletions of 18q, 17p and 8p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From Therapeutic Target Database, we identified relevant drugs, targeted to the genes located in these regions with CN changes, approved or in trials for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and common diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These drugs may be considered for future therapeutic trials in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, based on personalized cytogenetic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found many regions, harboring genes, which are not currently targeted by any relevant drugs that may be considered for future drug discovery studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study shows the application of high density SNP arrays for cytogenetic study in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its potential utility for personalized treatment </plain></SENT>
