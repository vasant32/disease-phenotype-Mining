<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of each examination included in the postoperative surveillance program, especially that of serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent curative surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) from January 2000 to December 2006 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postoperative surveillance program in our department includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and carbohydrate antigen [CA] 19-9) measurement every 3 months for 5 years, chest radiograph or chest computed tomography (CT) every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until 5 years, and abdominal CT every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first examination that revealed abnormality in patients who developed recurrence was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 105 recurrences were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 45 hepatic recurrences, 23 local recurrences, 20 pulmonary recurrences, 16 lymph node recurrences, and 10 peritoneal recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography, CEA, and CA 19-9 were the first abnormal examination(s) in 77, 23, and 26 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> markers detected the recurrence earlier than did CT in 27% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CEA and CA 19-9 equally contributed to detection with respect to the number of patients, while the sites of detected recurrences differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For early detection of occult recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, CT was the most reliable modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers were also relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given the recent advances in multimodal approaches for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the combination of CT, CEA, and CA 19-9, which is currently not included in guidelines, should be routinely performed </plain></SENT>
