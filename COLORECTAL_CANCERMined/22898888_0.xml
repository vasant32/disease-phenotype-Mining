<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells it induces DNA damage which leads to cytotoxicity with ensuing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or premature senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite its clinical use and efficiency in malignant colonocytes, its effects in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic cells are relatively underexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work we report that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 induces dose-dependent cytotoxicity which results in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and premature senescence whose occurrence nevertheless varies in relation to the type of exposed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic epithelial cells (NCM) the prevailing type of response is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> whereas in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic fibroblasts (NCF) it is premature senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analyses showed that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 induced in both types of cells DNA damage and activated stress response pathways including p53 and p16 but with varying activity of stress kinase p38 and selected stress-associated microRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Epithelial cells upregulated the expression of p53, which was subsequently specifically phosphorylated, massively activated p38 and initiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>, caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These events occurred in the presence of moderately increased expression of miR-34a only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in colonic fibroblasts p38 was only moderately activated, p53 as well as p16 expressions were upregulated in the presence of increased expression of miR-34a, miR-128a and miR-449a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was found only in a minority of treated cells and the premature senescence phenotype was prevailing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specific inhibition further proved that p53-dependent as well as independent mechanisms might be responsible for these cell type-specific differences </plain></SENT>
