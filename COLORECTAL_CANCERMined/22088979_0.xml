<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care shifts from hospital to outpatient settings, the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> caregivers continues to grow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> caregiving experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This gap in knowledge is especially evident for racially diverse caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study, part of a multisite study of care recipients with either lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and their caregivers, examined the caregiving experiences of African American (AA) and white caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Caregivers were identified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance consortium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Caregivers completed a self-administered, mailed questionnaire that assessed their characteristics and experiences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of covariance was used to compare racial groups by objective burden and caregiving resources while controlling for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite greater preparedness for the caregiving role (P = .006), AA caregivers reported more weekly hours caregiving than whites did (26.5 ± 3.1 vs 18.0 ± 1.7; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In later phases of caregiving, AAs reported having more social support (P = .02), spending more hours caregiving (31.9 ± 3.5 vs 16.9 ± 1.9; P &lt; .001), and performing more instrumental activities of daily living on behalf of their care recipient (P = .021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Racial differences in the caregiving experience exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses play a key role in educating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and their caregivers on how to effectively cope with and manage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because AA caregivers seem to spend more time in the caregiving role and perform more caregiving tasks, AA caregivers may benefit from interventions tailored to their specific caregiving experience </plain></SENT>
