<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed TOP1 gene copy number variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines with different sensitivities to the TOP1 inhibitor SN-38 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A TOP1 gene probe with a chromosome 20 centromere (CEN-20) reference probe was applied on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue from 50 stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, associations between TOP1/CEN-20 ratio and in vitro sensitivity to SN-38 (irinotecan) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> were tested on 10 CRC cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the malignant epithelium, 84% of the samples demonstrated an increased TOP1 gene copy number and 64% had an increased TOP1/CEN-20 ratio compared with the non-affected mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (32%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had a ratio of ≥ 1.5 and 9 (18%) of these had a ratio of ≥ 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive association was observed between the TOP1 gene copy number and the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio and in vitro sensitivity toward SN-38, but not toward <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large fraction of the clinical samples demonstrated increased TOP1 gene copy number and increased TOP1/CEN-20 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cell line study suggested an association between TOP1 gene copy number or TOP1/CEN-20 ratio and sensitivity to irinotecan but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
