<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify outcome differences amongst patients undergoing resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at English National Health Service trusts using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comparison was undertaken of trusts that submitted and those that did not submit, or submitted only poorly, voluntarily to a colorectal clinical registry, the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Audit Programme (NBOCAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The NBOCAP data set was used to classify trusts according to submitter status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HES data were used for outcome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data for major resections of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> performed between 1 August 2007 and 31 July 2008 were obtained from HES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trusts not submitting data to NBOCAP and those submitting less than 10 per cent of their total workload were termed 'non-submitters' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HES data for 30-day mortality, length of stay and readmission rates were compared according to submitter and non-submitter status in multifactorial analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 17,722 patients were identified from HES for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unadjusted 30-day in-hospital mortality rates were higher in non-submitting than in submitting trusts (5·2 versus 4·0 per cent; P = 0·005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Submitter status was independently associated with reduced 30-day mortality (odds ratio 0·76, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·61 to 0·96; P = 0·021) in regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A higher postoperative mortality rate following resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was found in trusts that do not voluntarily report data to NBOCAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Implications regarding the voluntary nature of submission to such registries should be reviewed if they are to be used for outcome benchmarking </plain></SENT>
