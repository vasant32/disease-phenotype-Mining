<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to obtain SEC2 mutant, preserving the important functional sites responsible for the T-cell stimulatory activities but removing the sites responsible for emetic activity, through truncation of SEC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It would efficiently solve the question of SEC2 side-effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the results of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> thiazol tetrazolium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay in vitro, novel truncated SEC2 mutant (NSM) efficiently stimulated T-cell proliferation and inhibited the growth of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells as human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells (Cx-1) and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells (MCF-7) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activities of T cell stimulating and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of NSM were similar to those of SEC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to results of animal experiments, the mutant no longer induced emetic response even if the dose was a 10-fold excess of the amount of SEC2 required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And also, NSM obviously inhibited the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we obtained novel truncated staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 mutant, which could efficiently inhibit the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It will become novel anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> agents with the lowest side-effects and best treatment effects in clinic </plain></SENT>
