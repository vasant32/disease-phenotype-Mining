<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue samples obtained from surgery at Uppsala University Hospital, were frozen fresh and cryosectioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two hapten molecules comprising 1,4,7-triazacyclononanetriacetic acid chelate moiety (NOTA) were labeled with (67)Ga or (68)Ga </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The autoradiography was conducted by incubating the tissue samples with the bispecific antibody TF2, followed by washing and incubation with one of the radiolabeled hapten molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After washing, drying and exposure to <z:chebi fb="27" ids="28659">phosphor</z:chebi> imager plates, the autoradiograms were analyzed and compared to standard histochemistry (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pronounced binding was found in the tissue from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using the bispecific antibody TF2 and either of the haptens [(67/68)Ga]Ga-IMP461 and [(67/68)Ga]Ga-IMP485 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distinct binding was also detected in the epithelium of most samples of neighboring tissue, taken at a minimum of 10 cm from the site of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that pretargeting CEA with the bispecific antibody TF2 followed by the addition of (67/68)Ga-labeled hapten is extremely sensitive for visualizing this marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This methodology is therefore a very specific complement to other histochemical techniques in the diagnosis of biopsies or in samples taken from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of the pretargeting technique in vivo may also be an advance in diagnosing patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, either using (67)Ga and SPECT or (68)Ga and PET </plain></SENT>
