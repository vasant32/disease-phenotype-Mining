<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, our group showed that CD24-based cell sorting can be used to isolate a fraction of murine small intestinal epithelial cells enriched in actively cycling stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, we hypothesized that CD24-based isolation of colonic epithelial cells would generate a fraction enriched in actively cycling colonic epithelial stem cells (CESCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry performed on mouse colonic tissue showed CD24 expression in the bottom half of proximal colon crypts and the crypt base in the distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This pattern of distribution was similar to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in Lgr5-EGFP mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Areas expressing CD24 contained actively proliferating cells as determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30085">ethynyl</z:chebi> deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, with a distinct difference between the proximal colon, where EdU-labeled cells were most frequent in the midcrypt, and the distal colon, where they were primarily at the crypt base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analyses of single epithelial cells, identified by epithelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (EpCAM) positivity, from mouse colon revealed an actively cycling CD24(+) fraction that contained the majority of Lgr5-EGFP(+) putative CESCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcript analysis by quantitative RT-PCR confirmed enrichment of active CESC markers [leucine-rich-repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), ephrin type B receptor 2 (EphB2), and CD166] in the CD24(+)EpCAM(+) fraction but also showed enrichment of quiescent CESC markers [leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobin domains (Lrig), doublecortin and calmodulin kinase-like 1 (DCAMKL-1), and murine telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTert)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CD24-based sorting in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice isolates a colonic epithelial fraction highly enriched in actively cycling and quiescent putative CESCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of CD24 expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic epithelium may have important implications for the use of anti-CD24-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
