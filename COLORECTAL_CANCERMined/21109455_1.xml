<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a population-based case-control study comparing 577 cases of left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 277 cases of right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n = 277) with 958 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary exposure was measured using a food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) were calculated across quintiles of dietary intakes of micronutrients, adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to those in the lowest quartiles of intake, we found a protective role of <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> particularly for right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (Q5 OR = 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-1.02) and protective associations for iron and zinc were observed with left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (Q5 OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.56-1.09 and Q5 OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46-0.92, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increased risk of left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, was observed for vitamin E (Q5 OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.97-1.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was observed for vitamin E and decreased risks were seen for <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi>, iron, and zinc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> according to subsite were observed for <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> and vitamin E </plain></SENT>
