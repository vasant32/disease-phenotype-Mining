<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As screening methods for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are limited by uptake and adherence, further options are sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A blood test might increase both, but none has yet been tested in a screening setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We prospectively assessed the accuracy of circulating methylated SEPT9 DNA (mSEPT9) for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a screening population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Asymptomatic individuals â‰¥50 years old scheduled for screening colonoscopy at 32 US and German clinics voluntarily gave blood plasma samples before colon preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a commercially available assay, three independent blinded laboratories assayed plasma DNA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and a stratified random sample of other subjects in duplicate real time PCRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes measures were standardised for overall sensitivity and specificity estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 7941 men (45%) and women (55%), mean age 60 years, enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results from 53 CRC cases and from 1457 subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> yielded a standardised sensitivity of 48.2% (95% CI 32.4% to 63.6%; crude rate 50.9%); for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stages I-IV, values were 35.0%, 63.0%, 46.0% and 77.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specificity was 91.5% (95% CI 89.7% to 93.1%; crude rate 91.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was low (11.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study using the blood based mSEPT9 test showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> signal in blood can be detected in asymptomatic average risk individuals undergoing screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the utility of the test for population screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> will require improved sensitivity for detection of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:: NCT00855348 </plain></SENT>
