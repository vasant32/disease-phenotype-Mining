<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated these associations using meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library in April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two evaluators independently reviewed and selected articles, based on pre-determined selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 737 articles meeting our initial criteria, 5 case-control studies, which involved 120,091 participants (9,514 cases and 110,577 controls), were included in the final analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> (used vs. never or rarely used) was not significantly associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a fixed-effects model meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 case-control studies (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96 to 1.20; I(2) = 3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, in sensitivity meta-analysis by cumulative duration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use, there was no association between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use of 1 year or longer and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a fixed-effects meta-analysis (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.22; I(2) = 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although hypergastrinemia could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, our study suggests that this does not lead to significant clinical risk for most <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies or randomized controlled trials related to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk are needed to investigate this association </plain></SENT>
