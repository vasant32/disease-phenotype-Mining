<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies describe an association between a high rate of microsatellite instability and a high total lymph node count in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Higher lymph node retrieval may potentially explain the improved survival seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigate whether these associations can be validated in a cohort of American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records from 200 cases of stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> resection specimens were reviewed, and sufficient tissue was available for 168 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of DNA mismatch repair proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry, and microsatellite status, by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean total lymph node count in cases with microsatellite instability versus microsatellite stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (15.9 versus 16.9; P = .664) and the mean number of negative lymph nodes in each respective category (12.2 versus 13.6; P = .522) were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between microsatellite stable cases and cases with microsatellite instability when total lymph node counts (P = .953) or negative lymph node counts (P = .381) were analyzed with respect to percentage of cases above and below the medians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This cohort of stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> does not support a significant relationship between microsatellite status and a higher retrieval of total or negative lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although microsatellite instability is associated with improved overall survival in our cohort (P = .026), the reason for this does not appear to be related to higher numbers of retrieved lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
