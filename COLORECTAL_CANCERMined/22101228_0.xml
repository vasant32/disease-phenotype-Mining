<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consensus guidelines recommend that high-risk groups initiate screening earlier with colonoscopy and more frequently than average risk persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a large proportion of high risk individuals do not receive regular colonoscopic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Family Health Promotion Project (FHPP) is a randomized-controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a telephone-based counseling intervention to increase adherence to risk-appropriate colonoscopy screening in high risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unaffected members of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> families from two national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> family registries were enrolled (n=632) and randomized to receive either a single session telephone counseling intervention using Motivational Interviewing techniques or a minimal mail-out intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint, rate of colonoscopy screening, was assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months post-enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we describe the research design and telephone counseling intervention of the FHPP trial, and report baseline data obtained from the two high risk cohorts recruited into this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results obtained at baseline confirm the need for interventions to promote colonoscopy screening among these high risk individuals, as well as highlighting several key opportunities for intervention, including increasing knowledge about risk-appropriate screening guidelines, and providing both tailored risk information and barriers counseling </plain></SENT>
