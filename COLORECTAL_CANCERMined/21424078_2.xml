<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to evaluate the impact of sentinel lymph node technique in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in lymphatic basin staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 43 consecutive operated cases, in which the identification of sentinel lymph node was performed during surgery (in vivo procedure - <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>) or immediately after the removal of the resection specimen (ex vivo procedure - <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases were matched with 45 control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identified sentinel lymph node was separately examined using multiple sections and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-Eosin staining method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detection rate, accuracy, sensitivity and false negative rate were better for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (86.36%; 84.21%; 66.66%; 23.07%) vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (61.9%; 84.61%; 50%; 18.18%), but there are no arguments for the feasibility of the technique in every day practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies and methods are mandatory in order to improve the staging of the pN status in colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
