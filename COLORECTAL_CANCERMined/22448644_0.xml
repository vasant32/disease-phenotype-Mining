<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to characterize clinicopathological features and identify prognostic factors of MUCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 181 patients with MUC who underwent surgery between 1975 and 2003 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathological features of these patients were compared with those of 4125 non-MUC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify significant prognostic factors in 102 patients with pT3 or pT4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> who underwent curative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with MUCs tended to present with more advanced clinical stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival rate of MUC patients was lower than that of non-MUC patients; however, no prognostic difference was found when patients with the same clinical stages were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed male sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> and infiltrating growth type as independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival rates for MUC patients with â‰¤1, 2 and 3 risk factors identified by multivariate analysis were 95.5%, 52.1% and 0.0%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> represents a distinct clinicopathological entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> and growth patterns might be useful prognostic factors to identify patients with a high risk of recurrence after curative resection of advanced MUCs </plain></SENT>
