<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of molecular biomarkers including TS expression, after pulmonary metastasectomy followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent metastasectomy for pulmonary recurrence from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for TS, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30839">orotate</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), microvessel density (MVD) assessed by CD34 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survival after pulmonary metastasectomy was significantly longer in patients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy than those without adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TS, OPRT, ERCC1, BRCA1 and CD34 expression was significantly associated with better outcome from the use of adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Expression level of TS, OPRT, ERCC1, BRCA1 and MVD in resected colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> may play an important role for predicting outcome after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
