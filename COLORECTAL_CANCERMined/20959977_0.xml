<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 264 patients, at average risk for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (105 men and 159 women; mean age 62 years ± 5 SD), underwent 32 rows CT colonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were alternatively placed into 2 study groups: Group 1 (n = 132) followed TC and Group 2 (n = 132) LFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TC protocol consisted of no fiber diet and Phospho-lax(®) 80 mL in 2 L of water the day before imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LFT protocol consisted of no fiber diet and ingestion with meals of 30 mL of water-soluble iodinated contrast agent (Gastrografin(®)) for 2 days before imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No frank <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> drugs were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were reviewed in a combined fashion, primary 2D followed by 3D endoluminal and dissected views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the examination <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were asked to provide a feedback about tolerance to the each bowel preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first 30 patients of each group were also investigated with optical colonoscopy (OC) used as gold standard to confirm our diagnosis (Group 1* and Group 2*) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LFT reduces discomfort and seems to improve diagnostic accuracy of CTC </plain></SENT>
