<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This outcome is now examined in a routine, population-based, screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three biennial rounds of the UK <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening pilot were completed in Scotland (2000-2007) before the roll out of a national programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> residents (50-69 years) in the three pilot Health Boards were invited for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They received a FOBT test by post to complete at home and return for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive tests were followed up with colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Controls, selected from non-pilot Health Boards, were matched by age, gender, and deprivation and assigned the invitation date of matched invitee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was from invitation date to 31 December 2009 or date of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> if earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 379 655 people in each group (median age 55.6 years, 51.6% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participation was 60.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 961 (0.25%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in invitees, 1056 (0.28%) in controls, rate ratio (RR) 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.99) overall and 0.73 (95% CI 0.65-0.82) for participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Non-participants had increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality compared with controls, RR 1.21 (95% CI 1.06-1.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a 10% relative reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality in a routine screening programme, rising to 27% in participants </plain></SENT>
