<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The increased utilization of smartphones within the clinical environment together with connected applications (apps) provides opportunity for doctors, including coloproctologists, to integrate such technology into clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the reliability of unregulated medical apps has recently been called into question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we review contemporary medical apps specifically themed towards colorectal diseases and assess levels of medical professional involvement in their design and content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The most popular smartphone app stores (iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Nokia, Windows and Samsung) were searched for colorectal disease themed apps, using the disease terms <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemorrhoids</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">anal fissure</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002607'>bowel incontinence</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 68 individual colorectal themed apps were identified, amongst which there were five duplicates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 29% of colorectal apps had had customer satisfaction ratings and 32% had named medical professional involvement in their development or content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The benefits of apps are offset by lack of colorectal specification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is little medical professional involvement in their design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased regulation is required to improve accountability of app content </plain></SENT>
