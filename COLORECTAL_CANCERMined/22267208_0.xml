<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated a detailed penetration/distribution profile of paclitaxel-rhodamine (PTX-rd) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (DOX) in multicellular layer (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) cultures of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells as an in vitro model for avascular regions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> were exposed to drugs and fluorescent images of frozen sections were acquired for determination of drug penetration into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> under various exposure conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTX-rd and DOX showed drastically different profiles of penetration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DOX showed full penetration after 1 h and accumulation over 3 h, whereas PTX-rd showed slow and limited penetration, with accumulation only within the top 20% of layers by 2 h and insignificant penetration even at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drug retention in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> was more dependent on drug concentration, rather than exposure time, i.e., drug distribution increased by 6.3- and 2.5-fold for PTX-rd and DOX, respectively, when exposed to higher concentrations under comparable AUC exposure (1 µM x 24 h vs. 50 µM x 0.5 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-proliferative activity of PTX and DOX in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, as determined by cell cycle analysis, was minimal and may be attributed, at least in part, to their limited distribution in multicellular cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, we demonstrated that penetration and retention of PTX and DOX in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> was not only concentration- and time-dependent, but also schedule-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that slow releasing formulations or a slow infusion regimen may not necessarily be desirable, especially for PTX, due to insufficient penetration and accumulation which may result from a low local concentration at the target site </plain></SENT>
