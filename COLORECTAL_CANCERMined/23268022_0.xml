<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After low anterior resection, mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab therapy was started for resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, he had to forgo liver resection because he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> (IP) after 6 courses of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
