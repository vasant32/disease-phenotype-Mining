<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To provide a quantitative assessment of this association, we summarized the evidence from observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relevant studies were identified in MEDLINE and EMBASE until December 31, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary relative risks (SRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled with a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was assessed using the Cochran's Q and I(2) statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 21 studies (16 case-control studies and five cohort/nested case-control studies) were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SRRs of CRA were 1.36 (95% CI = 1.17-1.58) for every 100 g/day increase in red meat intake, and 1.24 (95% CI = 1.12-1.36) for the highest versus the lowest level of red meat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonlinear dose-response meta-analysis indicated that CRA risk increased approximately linearly with increasing intake of red meat up to ~ 90 g/day, where the curve reached its plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgrouped analyses revealed that the increased risk of CRA with intake of red meat was independent of geographic locations, design and confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SRRs of CRA was 1.28 (95% CI = 1.03-1.60) for per 50 g/day increase in processed meat intake, and 1.17 (95% CI = 1.08-1.26) for the highest versus the lowest level of processed meat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased intake of red and processed meat is associated with significantly increased risk of CRA </plain></SENT>
