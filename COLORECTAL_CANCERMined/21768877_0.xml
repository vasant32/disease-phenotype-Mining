<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activation of ras family genes plays an important role in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequency of K-ras mutations and overexpression of the protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) vary between 14% and 50% and between 29% and 76%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We investigated the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and their relationship with point mutations of K-ras oncogene codons 12/13 and ras p21 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: K-ras codons 12 and 13 point mutations were examined by direct sequence analysis, whereas the ras p21 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistical analysis of immunohistochemical results showed that the expression of ras p21 was correlated with the advanced age of patients (P=0.0001), whereas loss of signal was associated with mucinous histotype (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the K-ras gene were detected in 12 of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations in K-ras gene were found in 12 of 52 tumors (23.07%), and 7 mutations were G→A transitions (58.33% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations), 4 were G→T transversions (33.33%), and only 1 was G→C transversion (8.33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 83.33% of the mutation occurred at codon 12 and 16.67% at codon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, K-ras mutations were associated with the sex of patients (P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic K-ras alterations were rather low in the Tunisian population, but further study is necessary to unravel the molecular background of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
