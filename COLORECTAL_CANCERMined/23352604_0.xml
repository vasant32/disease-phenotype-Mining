<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This randomised, multicenter, non-comparative phase II trial assessed the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus irinotecan (XELIRI) or infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin plus irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as first-line therapy for patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg on day 1 plus XELIRI (irinotecan 200mg/m(2) on day 1 and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1000mg/m(2) bid on days 1-14) every 3weeks or bevacizumab 5mg/kg on day 1 plus FOLFIRI (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> 400mg/m(2) on day 1 plus 2400mg/m(2) as a 46-h infusion, leucovorin 400mg/m(2) on day 1, and irinotecan 180mg/m(2) on day 1) every 2weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients aged â©¾65years received a lower dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (800mg/m(2) twice daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 145 patients were enrolled (bevacizumab-XELIRI, n=72; bevacizumab-FOLFIRI, n=73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 6-month PFS rate was 82% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 71-90%) in the bevacizumab-XELIRI arm and 85% (95% CI 75-92%) in the bevacizumab-FOLFIRI arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both the bevacizumab-XELIRI and bevacizumab-FOLFIRI arms, median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 9 and 23months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent toxicities were grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (bevacizumab-XELIRI 18%; bevacizumab-FOLFIRI 26%) and grade 3 diarrhoea (12% and 5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This randomised non-comparative study demonstrates that bevacizumab-XELIRI and bevacizumab-FOLFIRI are effective regimens for the first-line treatment of patients with mCRC with manageable toxicity profiles </plain></SENT>
