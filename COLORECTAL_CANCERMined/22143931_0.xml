<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and grade -both substantially affecting prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical assessment of p53 and Bcl-2 was retrospectively conducted (using DO-7 and Ca-124 monoclonal antibodies, respectively) in 119 surgically resected colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, and the results were correlated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> positively stained was 70% for p53 and 46% for Bcl-2, whereas co-expression of both markers was observed in 28% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> exhibiting the highest p53 staining (&gt;60% stained cells) were more frequently found in disease stage IV (p=0.03), while Bcl-2 positivity showed a predilection for earlier stage (p=0.02) and better grade (p=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The associations of both markers with stage, along with a reciprocal relationship between p53(+) and Bcl-2(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (p=0.02), stronger for cases with p53 staining &gt;30% (p=0.007), remained significant only for distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distinct correlations of p53 and Bcl-2 with disease progression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> (being influenced by the extent of staining and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site) may be clinically useful in the determination of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
