<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High resolution melting analysis (HRMA) is a mutation scanning method that allows detection of heterozygous sequence changes with high sensitivity, whereas homozygosity for a nucleotide change may not lead to significant curve shape or melting temperature changes compared to homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, HRMA has been mainly applied to the detection of mutations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> disorders, while applications to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> conditions are less common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MUTYH coding sequence and UTRs were analyzed by both HRMA and sequencing on 88 leukocyte genomic DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six samples were also examined by SSCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed both with and without mixing the test samples with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MUTYH sequence variations, including G &gt; C and A &gt; T homozygous changes, can be reliably identified by HRMA when a condition of artificial heterozygosity is created by mixing test and reference DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HRMA had a sensitivity comparable to sequencing and higher than SSCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The availability of a rapid and inexpensive method for the identification of MUTYH sequence variants is relevant for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> susceptibility, since the MAP phenotype is highly variable </plain></SENT>
