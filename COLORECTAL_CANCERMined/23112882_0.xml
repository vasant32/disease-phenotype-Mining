<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate for the combined years 1999 through 2003 was 30% higher than the rate among U.S. whites (USWs) for the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current incidence rates may serve to monitor the impact of screening programs in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the AN population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incidence data are from the Alaska Native <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Registry and the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared AN <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence, survival rates, and stage at diagnosis with rates in USWs for cases diagnosed from 2005 through 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative survival calculations were produced in SEER*Stat by the actuarial method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> age-adjusted incidence rate among AN men and women combined was higher than those in USW men and women (84 vs. 43/100,000; P &lt; .05; AN:USW rate ratio [RR] = 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The greatest differences between rates in AN people and USWs were for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the hepatic flexure (RR = 3.1) and in the transverse (RR = 2.9) and sigmoid (RR = 2.5) regions of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal cancer</z:e> rates among AN people were significantly higher than rates in USWs (21 vs.12/100,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five-year relative survival proportions by stage at diagnosis indicate that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> 5-year relative survival was similar in AN people and USWs for the period 2004 through 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in AN people emphasizes the need for screening programs and interventions to reduce known modifiable risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Research in methods to promote healthy behaviors among AN people is greatly needed </plain></SENT>
