<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in exon 3 (Y113H) and exon 4 (H139R) of the EPHX1 have been associated with enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in relation to the EPHX1 Y113H and H139R polymorphisms and assessed effect modifications of cigarette smoking and the other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interaction between the EPHX1 polymorphisms and selected genetic polymorphisms was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used data from Fukuoka <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Study, a community-based case-control study, including 685 cases and 778 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In-person interviews were conducted to assess lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EPHX1 Y113H and H139R polymorphisms were determined by the TaqMan assay and the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither of the two polymorphisms nor the imputed EPHX1 phenotype was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking and alcohol intake showed no effect modification on the association with the EPHX1 polymorphisms or the imputed EPHX1 phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with the 113Y allele and imputed EPHX1 phenotype were observed among individuals with high body mass index (BMI; ≥25.0 kg/m(2) ), but not among those with low BMI (&lt;25.0 kg/m(2) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk decreased with an increasing number of the 139R allele in the null genotypes of GSTM1/GSTT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that the EPHX1 polymorphisms play an important role in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The observed interactions of the EPHX1 polymorphisms with BMI and the GSTM1/GSTT1 genotypes warrant further investigation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
