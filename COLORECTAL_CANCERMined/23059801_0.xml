<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on national and international studies it has been required to include them into the national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening programme in Germany also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity (detection limit) can be set by the manufacturer in order to achieve an optimal and balanced result between sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted with 639 patients who have undergone both the screening colonoscopy, as well as the immunochemical stool blood test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The test "immoCARE-C" provided by the company CARE diagnostica Laborreagenzien GmbH was used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The test has been evaluated with seven levels of detection limits between 500  ng/mL and 25  ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best sensitivity for detection of advanced lesions was demonstrated by a cut-off of 50 ng/mL and 25  ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity did not fall below 90  % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These positive results lead to considerations to organise a primary access to such tests in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as a kind of filter before offering the screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
