<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ABCSG-8 (Austrian Breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Study Group 8) study is a large phase III clinical trial addressing the sequence strategy containing ANA in comparison with 5 years of TAM in a low- to intermediate-risk group of postmenopausal patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">Endocrine</z:chebi> receptor-positive patients with G1 or G2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After surgery, patients were randomly assigned to 5 years of TAM or 2 years of TAM followed by 3 years of ANA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant chemotherapy and G3 and T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intention-to-treat and censored analyses of on-treatment recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) were performed, and exploratory survival end points and toxicity were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Information from 3,714 patients, including 17,563 woman-years, with a median of 60 months of follow-up was available for this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age was 63.8 years, 75% were node negative, and 75% had T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of ANA after identical 2-year treatment with TAM in both arms did not result in a statistically significant improvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.01; P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exploratory analyses of distant relapse-free survival indicated a 22% improvement (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On-treatment adverse events and serious adverse events were consistent with known toxicity profiles of ANA and TAM treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite a low overall rate of recurrence in a population with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> at limited risk of relapse, the a priori sequence strategy of 2 years of TAM followed by 3 years of ANA led to small outcome and toxicity benefits </plain></SENT>
