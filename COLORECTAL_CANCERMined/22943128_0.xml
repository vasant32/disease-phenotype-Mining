<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They can also affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi> in tea are known to have <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties that can quench free radical species, and pro-oxidant activities that appear to be responsible for the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bioavailability of these natural compounds is an important factor that determines their efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated delivery techniques of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> and TFs have been found to improve their bioavailability to a level that could benefit their effectiveness as chemopreventives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aim: The present study was conducted to compare the effects of TFs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>, when used in the bulk form and in the polymer (poly[lactic-co-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17497">glycolic acid</z:chebi>])-based NP form, in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>- and satraplatin-treated lymphocytes as surrogate cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Materials &amp; methods: NPs were examined for their size distribution, surface <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, entrapment efficiency and release profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes were treated in the Comet assay with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and satraplatin, washed and treated with bulk or NP forms of tea <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenols</z:chebi>, washed and then treated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> to determine single-strand breaks after crosslinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: The results of DNA damage measurements by the Comet assay revealed opposite trends in bulk and NP forms of TFs, as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the compounds in the bulk form produced statistically significant concentration-dependent reductions in DNA damage in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>- or satraplatin-treated lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when used in the NP form both TFs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>, although initially causing a reduction, produced a concentration-dependent statistically significant increase in DNA damage in the lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Discussion: These observations support the notion that TFs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> act as both <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> and pro-oxidants, depending on the form in which they are administered under the conditions of investigation </plain></SENT>
