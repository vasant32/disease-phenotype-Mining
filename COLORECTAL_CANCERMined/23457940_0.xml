<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports showed that micrometastases detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) appeared to have no clinical impact, but that occult disease detected by molecular techniques such as RT-PCR might be associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At present, several factors are proposed as high risks for disease recurrence of stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, including T4 invasiveness, vascular invasion, poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding, wall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and insufficient assessment of dissected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it was reported that 75% of 24,847 stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients retained specific risk factors, and the efficacy of chemotherapy in such patients has not been confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A recent meta-analysis by Weitz et al. has concluded that occult disease was significantly associated with poor prognosis of node-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, irrespective of the detection method, i.e., IHC or RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For efficient selection of high-risk stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, a prospective, large-scale clinical trial is essential using a convenient, simple molecular modality such as the one-step nucleic acid amplification assay </plain></SENT>
