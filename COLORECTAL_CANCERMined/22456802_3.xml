<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a larger proportion of patients are treated with chemotherapy prior to liver resection, the safety of PTC in patients with chemotherapy-associated liver injury remains poorly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to evaluate the influence of PTC on early postoperative outcomes in patients with chemotherapy-associated liver injury undergoing major hepatectomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2000 to October 2010, 53 patients with histologically proven chemotherapy-associated liver injuries [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinusoidal obstruction syndrome</z:e> (SOS; n = 41), steatohepatitis (n = 5), and both SOS and steatohepatitis (n = 7)] who underwent major hepatectomy for CLM were divided into two groups; patients undergoing intermittent TPC (n = 20) and those who did not undergo TPC (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perioperative clinicobiological factors, morbidity including septic complications, and mortality were analyzed and compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraoperative blood transfusions and postoperative liver function were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>Sepsis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biloma</z:e> occurred more often in patients undergoing PTC longer than 30 min than in those undergoing PTC ≤ 30 min (66.7 % versus 17.1 %, p = 0.002, and 33.3 versus 0 %, p = 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that prolonged PTC (&gt;30 min) and the ratio of future liver remnant volume to total liver volume ≤ 43 % were independent factors for predicting postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR): 32.68; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI): 2.86-372.82; p = 0.005--and odds ratio: 9.70; 95 % CI: 1.04-90.86; p = 0.047, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Portal triad clamping can be safely used in patients with chemotherapy-associated liver injury who require major liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prolonged PTC can increase the occurrence of postoperative biliary and septic complications </plain></SENT>
