<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively analyzed 172 patients who underwent potentially curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (TNM I-III) between 2002 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained from medical charts, including age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, TNM stage, mortality, follow-up duration, and preoperative CEA and CA 19-9 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A CEA &gt; or = 5ng/mL was defined as abnormal (CEA+), while the cutoff for the CA19-9 was set at 37U/mL (CA19-9+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized into Groups I-IV according to the preoperative serum CEA and CA 19-9 levels [CEA/ CA 19-9: (-/-), (+/-), (-/+), and (+/+)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up was longest for Group I (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates were higher in Groups V (p&lt;0.001) and II (p&lt;0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On comparing patients according to CEA levels, survival was longer in the CEA-negative group (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On comparison according to CA 19-9 levels, survival was greater in the CA 19-9-negative group (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While CEA (p&lt;0.016) and CA 19-9 (p&lt;0.001) were independent prognostic factors according to the logistic regression analysis, TNM (p=0.002), CEA (p&lt;0.001), and CA 19-9 (p&lt;0.001) were prognostic factors in the ROC curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with elevated levels of both CEA and CA 19-9 have a significantly poorer prognosis than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
