<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cell-targeting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> or proteins are appealing tools in nanomedicine and innovative medicines because they increase the local drug concentration and reduce potential side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is a cell surface marker associated with several severe human pathologies, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, for which intracellular targeting agents are currently missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four different <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that bind CXCR4 were tested for their ability to internalize a green fluorescent protein-based reporter nanoparticle into CXCR4‚Å∫ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, only the 18 mer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> T22, an engineered segment derivative of polyphemusin II from the horseshoe crab, efficiently penetrated target cells via a rapid, receptor-specific endosomal route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This resulted in accumulation of the reporter nanoparticle in a fully fluorescent and stable form in the perinuclear region of the target cells, without toxicity either in cell culture or in an in vivo model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Given the urgent demand for targeting agents in the research, diagnosis, and treatment of CXCR4-linked diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e>, T22 appears to be a promising tag for the intracellular delivery of protein drugs, nanoparticles, and imaging agents </plain></SENT>
