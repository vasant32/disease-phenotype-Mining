<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the aspirin effect has been shown to occur primarily in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy has been either less effective or ineffective in the proximal compared to the distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding low-dose aspirin to a simulated screening with colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A Markov model comparing the strategies of 10-year colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy screening and the combination of either of the two with low-dose aspirin in 100,000 subjects aged 50 years until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proximal and distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention rates with endoscopy or aspirin were extracted from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening and aspirin prevention were simulated to stop at 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cost of aspirin and aspirin-related complications, as well as aspirin-related mortality, was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between the different strategies were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The addition of low-dose aspirin to colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy screening increased the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> prevention rate from 68% and 39% to 81% and 69%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lifetime aspirin-related mortality appeared to be 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of the substantial reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> care, the addition of aspirin to colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy screening was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: US$5413 per life-year saved) and cost saving (US$278 per person), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When the proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention rate with colonoscopy was increased 56% to 73% from the baseline, the addition of aspirin was no longer cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The addition of aspirin to colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy was a cost-effective strategy in 52% and 94% of the scenarios at probabilistic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When assuming a suboptimal efficacy of endoscopy in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the addition of low-dose aspirin may be an effective and cost-effective strategy, mainly because of its high efficacy in preventing proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
