<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, advice from a trusted source may also contribute to autonomous decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined preferences regarding a recommendation from the NHS and information provision in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In face-to-face interviews, a population-based sample of adults across Britain (n=1964; age 50-80 years) indicated their preference between: (1) a strong recommendation to participate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, (2) a recommendation alongside advice to make an individual decision, and (3) no recommendation but advice to make an individual decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other measures included trust in the NHS and preferences for information on benefits and risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most respondents (84%) preferred a recommendation (47% strong recommendation, 37% recommendation plus individual decision-making advice), but the majority also wanted full information on risks (77%) and benefits (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men were more in favour of a recommendation than women (86% vs 81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Trust in the NHS was high overall, but the minority who expressed low trust were less likely to want a recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most British adults want full information on risks and benefits of screening but they also want a recommendation from an authoritative source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An 'expert' view may be an important part of autonomous health decision-making </plain></SENT>
