<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed which nutrition evaluation method [subjective global assessment (SGA); <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> universal screening tool (MUST); nutritional risk index (NRI)] provided the most efficacious combination of high validity, low cost, and ease of use to examine and improve the status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SGA, MUST, and NRI scales were used to analyze the preoperative status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> for 45 CRC patients in a medical center in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in the reliability of the 3 methods were compared using the kappa (κ) coefficient of agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lengths of hospital stays were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test to examine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SGA κ coefficient was higher with the MUST than with the NRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative weight losses were significantly different on the NRI, and the longer the length of the hospital stay, the greater was the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the SGA had a higher validity and lower cost than the NRI, we recommend using the MUST method for a routine nutrition evaluation because it is easier to use and is less expensive than the SGA and the NRI </plain></SENT>
