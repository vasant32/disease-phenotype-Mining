<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Genomewide expression profiling has identified a number of genes differentially expressed in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these genes were linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested whether genes including desmocollins and homeobox genes were distinct on the protein level and correlated the expression with clinicopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue microarrays of 402 R0-resected colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of UICC stage II or III were constructed to evaluate ten biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of desmocollins was evaluated in eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demethylation test was performed by treatment with 5-aza-2Â´-deoxycytide in five <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On protein level, high expression of desmocollin 1 (DSC1) was observed in 41.6%, DSC2 in 58.0%, DSC3 in 61.4%, E-cadherin in 71.4%, CDX2 in 58.0%, PITX1 in 55.0%, CDK4 in 0.2%, TLE1 in 1.3%, Factor H in 42.5%, and MDM2 in 0.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of DSC1-3 was statistically linked to higher grading and DSC2, E-cadherin and CDX2 with shorter survival in high-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that pathological stage and low PITX1 expression were statistically associated with shorter patients survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, seven out of eight cell lines exhibited no expression of DSC1, and four out of seven restored DSC1 expression after demethylation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced expression of PITX1 was independently correlated to shorter patients survival and could serve as a prognostic marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreased expression of DSC1-3 is significantly correlated with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of DSC1 could be explained by DNA hypermethylation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
