<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to determine, in rural settings, the relation between the type and status of insurance coverage and being up-to-date for breast, cervical, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four primary care practices in 2 rural Oregon communities participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical chart reviews that were conducted between October 2008 and August 2009 assessed insurance coverage and up-to-date status for breast, cervical, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria involved having at least 1 health care visit within the past 5 years and being aged â‰¥ 55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients were women aged 55 years to 70 years, employed or retired, and who had private health insurance and an average of 2.5 comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall percentage of eligible women who were up-to-date for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> screening was 30%; approximately 27% of women were up-to-date for clinical breast examination, 37% were up-to-date for mammography, and 19% were up-to-date for both mammography and clinical breast examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 38% of men and 35% of women were up-to-date for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening using any test at appropriate screening intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, having any insurance versus being uninsured was associated with undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For each type of screening, patients who had at least 1 health maintenance visit were significantly more likely to be up-to-date compared with those with no health maintenance visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant interaction was found between having health maintenance visits, having any health insurance, and being up-to-date for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the percentage of patients who were up-to-date for any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> screening, was found to be very low in rural Oregon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with some form of health insurance were more likely to have had a health maintenance visit within the previous 2 years and to be up-to-date for breast, cervical, and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
