<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: ITCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> regional to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were assessed in 312 consecutive patients with pN0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who were followed up clinically and/or endoscopically for at least 6 months after surgery (mean, 67 months; median, 64 months; range, 8 to 102 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> were dissected from gross surgical specimens according to a standardized protocol (with a mean of 17 LNs per patient; range, five to 107 LNs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 5,313 pN0 LNs were collected and assessed by using cytokeratin immunostaining in two serial histology sections from each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>, which amounting to a total of 10,626 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation between ITC status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> was tested by using univariate and multivariate statistics </plain></SENT>
