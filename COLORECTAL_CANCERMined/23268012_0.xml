<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the usefulness of serum anti-p53 antibody (anti-p53) measurement for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>. carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, and anti-p53 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 375 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 115 healthy volunteers(control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the cut-off level of the serum anti-p53 antibody was set to 1.3 U/mL, 114 (30.4%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients tested positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve positive cases(10.4%) were recognized in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median levels of anti-p53 were 0.69 U/mL(0.69- 10,610) and 0.69 U/mL (0.69-19.5) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive rates of CEA level (cut-off value 6.7 ng/mL) and CA19-9 level (cut-off value 37 U/mL) were 40.0% and 18.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers, positive cases with only anti-p53 were observed in 60 patients (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers examined was 61.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was observed between the level of anti-p53 and other markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive rates of anti-p53 in each stage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients were as follows: stage 0 and I, 19.4%; stage II, 27.0%; stage III,36.1%; and stage IV,61.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of anti-p53 was higher than that of CEA and CA19-9 in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a combination of these markers improved the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by approximately 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the measurement of anti-p53 is useful for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
