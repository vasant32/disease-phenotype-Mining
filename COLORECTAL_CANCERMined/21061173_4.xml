<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whether people who inherit a mutation in MUTYH from only one parent (monoallelic mutation) are at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most previous studies and meta-analyses have not found statistically significant associations but, given carriers are relatively rare, may be underpowered to detect small increased risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have conducted a systematic review and meta-regression analysis of previously published case-control studies to estimate the strength of association for monoallelic MUTYH mutation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have compared the carrier frequency in cases with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> to that of controls, as a novel and powerful design, to measure statistical evidence of an association but not the strength of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the genotype-disease association, estimated from a pooled odds ratio comparing cases unselected for family history with controls, was 1.15 (95% CI = 0.98-1.36) and not substantially altered by adjustment for potential sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monoallelic mutation carrier frequency was greater for cases ascertained due to a family history (3.3%; SE 0.9%) than for controls (1.4%; SE 0.3%) (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers are at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> but the average increase is small </plain></SENT>
