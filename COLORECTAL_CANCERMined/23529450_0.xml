<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we examined correlates of screening among Appalachian residents at average-risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a population-based sample, we conducted interviews with and obtained medical records of Appalachian Ohio residents 51-75 years between September 2009 and April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using multivariable logistic regression, we identified correlates of being within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines by medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About half of participants were within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants who were older (OR = 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.07), had higher income ($30,000-$60,000, OR = 1.92, 95 % CI 1.29, 2.86; ≥$60,000, OR = 1.80, 95 % CI 1.19, 2.72), a primary care provider (OR = 4.22, 95 % CI 1.33, 13.39), a recent check-up (OR = 2.37, 95 % CI 1.12, 4.99), had been encouraged to be screened (OR = 1.57, 95 % CI 1.11, 2.22), had been recommended by their doctor to be screened (OR = 6.68, 95 % CI 3.87, 11.52), or asked their doctor to order a screening test (OR = 2.24, 95 % CI 1.36, 3.69) had higher odds of being screened within guidelines in multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest that access to and utilization of healthcare services, social influence, and patient-provider communication were the major factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Researchers and healthcare providers should develop and implement strategies targeting these barriers/facilitators to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates and reduce the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> burden among residents of Appalachia </plain></SENT>
