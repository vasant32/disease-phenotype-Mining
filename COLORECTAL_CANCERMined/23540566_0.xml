<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Background: Recently, it has been found that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients have a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> than the general population, but epidemiological studies examining a potential relationship between the two have produced inconsistent conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we set out to perform a meta-analysis of cohort studies to evaluate the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: Using "<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>," "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>," and associated key words, we performed a systematic review of published cohort studies in multiple databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge databases, OVID, CNKI, CBMD ISC, WANFANG, and CQVIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then applied stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify which studies to include in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STATA version 12.0 software (StataCorp., College Station, TX) was used to conduct statistical analysis, including consolidated statistics calculations, tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and publication bias evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: We obtained a total of 532 potential articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In accordance with our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected 29 articles for the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis of extracted information indicated that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a risk factor for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (relative risk 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses by control populations, regions, gender, follow-up time, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> site also support this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The risk of individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is 1.22 times higher than that of individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The positive association remains consistent for both men and women and for studies carried out in North America, Europe, and Asia, as well as for different follow-up times </plain></SENT>
