<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of DNA variants in LS patients are unclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reports on the pathogenicity of the c.1852_1853AA&gt;GC (p.Lys618Ala) variant of the MLH1 gene are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we provide new evidence indicating that this variant has no significant implications for LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The following approach was used to assess the clinical significance of the p.Lys618Ala variant: frequency in a control population, case-control comparison, co-occurrence of the p.Lys618Ala variant with a pathogenic mutation, co-segregation with the disease and microsatellite instability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> from carriers of the variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We genotyped p.Lys618Ala in 1034 individuals (373 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>] patients, 250 index subjects from families suspected of having LS [revised Bethesda guidelines] and 411 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three well-characterized LS families that fulfilled the Amsterdam II Criteria and consisted of members with the p.Lys618Ala variant were included to assess co-occurrence and co-segregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> DNA samples from 17 patients carrying the p.Lys618Ala variant was screened for microsatellite instability using five <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven individuals were heterozygous for the p.Lys618Ala variant; nine had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (2.41%), seven were suspected of having hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (2.8%) and 11 were controls (2.68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant associations in the case-control and case-case studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The p.Lys618Ala variant was co-existent with pathogenic mutations in two unrelated LS families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one family, the allele distribution of the pathogenic and unclassified variant was in trans, in the other family the pathogenic variant was detected in the MSH6 gene and only the deleterious variant co-segregated with the disease in both families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only two positive cases of microsatellite instability (2/17, 11.8%) were detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> from p.Lys618Ala carriers, indicating that this variant does not play a role in functional inactivation of MLH1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The p.Lys618Ala variant should be considered a neutral variant for LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for the clinical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> probands and their relatives </plain></SENT>
