<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study thus examines the long-term trends of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were collective between patients aged 30 years or older and younger than 85 years from the Taiwan <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registries during 1971-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard descriptive techniques such as age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), aural percent change, and age-period-cohort analyses were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increase of percentage change by each age group in men was higher than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ASMR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> increased 2-fold for men and almost 1.5-fold for women during the periods 1971-1975 and 2006-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For age-period-cohort analysis, the estimated mortality rate increased steadily with age in both sexes, and plateaued at 175.29 per 100,000 people for men and 128.14 per 100,000 for women in the 80- to 84-year-old group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Period effects were weak in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cohort effects were strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Between 30 and 59 years of age, the sex ratio showed that the female <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality rate was higher than that of their male counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the mortality risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in men was higher than that in women when they were between 60 and 84 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current findings showed a consistent increase in mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Changes in the patient sex ratio indicated an important etiological role of sex hormones, especially in women aged 60 years or younger </plain></SENT>
