<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rapidly growing insight into the molecular biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, as well as recent developments in gene sequencing and molecular diagnostics, has led to high expectations for the identification of molecular markers to be used in personalized treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of action and toxicities of targeted therapies differ from those of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Targeted therapy has raised new insight about the possibility of tailoring treatment to an individual's disease, the assessment of drug effectiveness and toxicity, and the economics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper covers the last decade of clinical trials that have explored the toxicity and efficacy of targeted agents in locally advanced and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and how their role may benefit patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future efforts should include prospective studies of these agents in biomarker-defined subpopulations, as well as studies of novel agents that target <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-stromal interaction, and the cell signaling pathways implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
