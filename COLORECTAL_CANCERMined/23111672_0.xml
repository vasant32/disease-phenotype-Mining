<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: A 54-year-old Asian man received his first infusion of cetuximab after pretreatment with ondansetron, <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi>, diphenhydramine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 15 minutes after initiation of the cetuximab infusion, the patient called for help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nurse found the patient sitting up with a blank stare, and the patient began to have a generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The emergency resuscitation team was called and administered lorazepam 2 mg i.v., at which time the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> ceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient required emergent intubation, but no cardiopulmonary resuscitation was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After intubation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the head found no evidence of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient remained stable, was extubated, and was transferred out of the intensive care unit the next day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, the patient returned for follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and head with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Per the radiologist's report, there were no enhancing lesions to suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, no abnormalities to suggest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and no bone abnormalities, and the patient's brain volume was within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits for his age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on the Naranjo et al. probability scale score, the relationship between the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and cetuximab infusion was probable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A 54-year-old Asian man developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity requiring emergent intubation during his initial cetuximab infusion for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
