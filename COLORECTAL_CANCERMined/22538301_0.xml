<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The NHS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme (BCSP) uses faecal occult blood (FOB) testing to select patients aged 60-69 years for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the association between aspirin use and the detection of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in screened patients undergoing colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected prospectively on individuals who underwent colonoscopy following a positive FOB test in the South of Tyne area between February 2007 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the presence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and current aspirin use were evaluated using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 701 individuals underwent colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>414 (59.1%) were male and 358 (51.1%) aged over 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Males had a higher incidence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (relative risk 2.26, 95% CI 1.65-3.10, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current aspirin use was associated with a lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> detection rate (relative risk 0.79, 95% CI 0.50-0.98, p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased age and BMI were not significantly associated with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Amongst individuals undergoing colonoscopy following a positive FOB test in the BCSP, current aspirin use was associated with a lower incidence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may represent the chemopreventative effect of aspirin or increased false positivity of FOB testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed to clarify the contribution of each and could reduce the number of unnecessary colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
