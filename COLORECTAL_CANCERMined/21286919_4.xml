<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our meta-analysis is to evaluate the real effects of C and P in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients treated in randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible studies included prospective, randomized, and controlled trials in which either C or P had been added to standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> therapy or best supportive care and data for KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients only had been calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six thousand three hundred ninety-five patients' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples have been analyzed (total <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> n = 3,254; experimental arm n = 1,608; control arm n = 1,646) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for response rate were calculated, as well as hazard ratios (HRs)for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall RR of response rate is 1.69 (p = 0.003) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall HRs for PFS and survival are 0.65 (p = 0.0006) and 0.84 (p = 0.03), respectively, and both are significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HRs for PFS and survival in C trials are 0.64 and 0.79, respectively, and 0.65 and 0.87, respectively, in P trials, although only the results achieved in P trials are significant (p = 0.0007 and p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both response rate (RR = 10.94) and PFS (HR = 0.51) have increased more in pretreated patients than in first-line trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies to standard anticancer therapy in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> showed an overall significantly increased risk of objective response rate and increased progression-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only the results achieved in P randomized trials are significant, and the strongest results have been achieved in pretreated patients </plain></SENT>
