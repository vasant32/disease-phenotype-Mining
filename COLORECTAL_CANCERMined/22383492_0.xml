<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the complete spectrum of KRAS targets that mediate its tumorigenic effect has not yet been fully delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4), a transforming growth factor-Î² family member that regulates development and tissue homeostasis, as a new target of KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SW480, Hela, and 293 cells, oncogenic KRAS(V12) downregulated BMP4 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels, a BMP4 promoter luciferase construct, and Bmp4 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MEK inhibitor PD98059 but not the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked this downregulation of BMP4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To identify the region of the BMP4 promoter that mediated this regulation by KRAS, serial 5'-deletions of the promoter were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An inhibitory region was identified between -3,285 and -3,258 bp in the Bmp4 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, oncogenic KRAS can downregulate Bmp4 through a transcriptional pathway that depends on ERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings point to a unique link between two pathways that are frequently altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
