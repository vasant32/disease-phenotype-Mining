<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study assessed the association between Type D personality (the conjoint effect of negative affectivity and social inhibition) and quality of life (QoL) and mental health of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors up to 10 years post-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> currently alive individuals diagnosed with endometrial or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1998 and 2007, or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> between 1999 and 2008 as registered in the Eindhoven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry received a questionnaire on Type D personality (DS14), QoL (SF-36 or EORTC-QLQ-C30) and mental health (HADS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 3080 survivors who responded (69%), 572 (19%) had a Type D personality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type D survivors had clinically meaningful lower levels of general health, social functioning, role-function emotional, mental health and vitality compared to non-Type D's (SF-36: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P's&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also reported clinically meaningful worse emotional and social functioning, global health status/QoL, and more <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (EORTC-QLQ-C30: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P's&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was also confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analyses showing that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors with a Type D personality were more likely to experience a decreased QoL on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SF-36 and EORTC-QLQ-C30 scales (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ORs ranging between 1.88 and 5.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of survivors reporting an impaired QoL was higher among Type D (35-64%) than non-Type D's (20-36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, Type D's were more likely to be depressed (44% vs. 13%; P&lt;0.0001) or anxious (51% vs. 14%; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> survivors with a Type D personality are at increased risk of impaired QoL and mental health problems that cannot be explained by socio-demographic or clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
