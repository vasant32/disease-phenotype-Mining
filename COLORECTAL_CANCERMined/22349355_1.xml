<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated associations between cigarette smoking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk stratified by KRAS mutation status, using data and tissue resources from the Iowa Women's Health Study (IWHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The IWHS is a population-based cohort study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence among 41,836 randomly selected Iowa women, ages 55-69 years of age at enrollment (1986) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure data, including cigarette smoking, were obtained by self-report at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (n=1,233) were ascertained by annual linkage with the Iowa <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Archived tissue specimens from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases recorded through 2002 were recently requested for molecular epidemiology investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> KRAS mutation status was determined by direct sequencing of exon 2, with informative results in 507/555 (91%) available <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases (342 mutation negative and 165 mutation positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression models were fit to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between cigarette smoking variables and KRAS-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple smoking variables were associated with increased risk for KRAS mutation-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, including age at initiation (P=0.02), average number of cigarettes per day (P=0.01), cumulative pack-years (P=0.05), and induction period (P=0.04), with the highest point estimate observed for women who smoked â‰¥40 cigarettes per day on average (RR=2.38; 95% CI=1.25-4.51; compared with never smokers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further consideration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subsite suggested that cigarette smoking may be a stronger risk factor for KRAS mutation-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> located in the proximal colon than in the distal colorectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the smoking variables were significantly associated with KRAS mutation-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (overall or stratified by anatomic subsite) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from this prospective study of older women demonstrate differential associations between cigarette smoking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subtypes defined by KRAS mutation status, and are consistent with the hypothesis that smoking adversely affects the serrated pathway of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
