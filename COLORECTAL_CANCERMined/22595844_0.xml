<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation carriers have a high risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> has been diagnosed, in general, subtotal colectomy instead of partial colectomy is recommended because of the substantial risk of metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of more extensive surgery on quality of life and functional outcome is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate quality of life and functional outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> after partial colectomy and subtotal colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a nationwide cross-sectional study in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: Two quality-of-life questionnaires (Short Form-36 and The European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e>-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire Module) and a functional outcome questionnaire (Colorectal Functional Outcome) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> who underwent surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were quality of life and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Questionnaires were sent to 192 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 136 patients returned the questionnaire (response rate, 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, 9 patients with a permanent ileostomy, and 5 patients with an IPAA were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients underwent partial colectomy, and 53 underwent subtotal colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the scales of the Short Form-36 survey showed a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the Colorectal Functional Outcome questionnaire revealed that, after subtotal colectomy, patients have a significantly higher stool frequency (p ≤ 0.01) and a significantly higher score on stool-related aspects (p = 0.06) and social impact (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e>-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire Module presented more problems with defecation after subtotal colectomy (p ≤ 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Certain selection bias cannot be ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although functional outcome is worse after subtotal colectomy than after partial colectomy, generic quality of life does not differ after the 2 types of surgery in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>When discussing the options for surgery with the patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> advantages and disadvantages of both surgical procedures, including quality of life and functional outcome, should be discussed </plain></SENT>
