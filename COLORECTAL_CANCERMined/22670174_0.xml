<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present retrospective study, we tested the hypothesis that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) as a treatment for patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) may reduce intrahepatic micrometastases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence and distribution of intrahepatic micrometastases were determined in specimens resected from 63 patients who underwent hepatectomy for CRLM (21 treated with NAC and 42 without) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the therapeutic efficacy of NAC was evaluated histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intrahepatic micrometastases were defined as microscopic lesions spatially separated from the gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distance from these lesions to the border of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumor</z:mpath> was measured on histological specimens and the density of intrahepatic micrometastases (number of lesions/mm(2)) was determined in regions close to (&lt;1 cm) the gross <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumor</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 patients treated with NAC, 13 were identified as having a partial response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> (RECIST) guidelines; thus, the overall response rate was 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of NAC was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response to NAC according to the RECIST guidelines (p=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 260 intrahepatic micrometastases were detected in 39 patients (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intrahepatic micrometastases were less frequently detected in NAC-treated patients than in untreated patients (5/21 [24%] vs. 34/42 [81%], respectively; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the distance and density of intrahepatic micrometastases between the two groups (p=0.313 and p=0.526, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NAC reduces the incidence of intrahepatic micrometastases in patients with CRLM, but NAC has no significant effect on their distribution when intrahepatic micrometastases are present </plain></SENT>
