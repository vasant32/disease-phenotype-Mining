<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inaccurate size estimation can lead to inappropriate surveillance recommendations of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-sizing on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surveillance recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was conducted in a gastroenterology practice at a US academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and surveillance colonoscopies from 2010 to 2011 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Endoscopic size estimates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> 10 to 25 mm were compared with postfixation histopathologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> measurements for 15 different gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> removed in entirety by snare polypectomy were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Size variation was defined as (endoscopic estimate - histopathologic size)/(histopathologic size) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-sizing was defined as a size variation of &gt;33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean size variation, the percentage of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-sizing, and the percentage of inappropriate surveillance recommendation due to size variation &gt;33% were reported per endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Included for analysis were 4990 procedures from 15 gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of 230 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> from 200 patients met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The average age was 62.6 years (SD 10.1), and 52% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean size variation between the endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size estimation and the histopathologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> was 73.6% (range of mean size variation, 13%-127%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>62.6% (range, 0%-91%) of included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> had clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-sizing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Of included polypectomies, 35.2% (range, 0%-67%) resulted in an inappropriate surveillance recommendation due to clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-sizing even after considering histology and synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This was a single-center study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is marked variation in endoscopists' ability to accurately size <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Some endoscopists rarely <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-size <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and their surveillance recommendations are appropriate in regard to sizing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, other endoscopists inaccurately size <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and this leads to inappropriate surveillance of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In this study, approximately 1 of 3 included polypectomies yielded inappropriate surveillance recommendations because of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-sizing </plain></SENT>
