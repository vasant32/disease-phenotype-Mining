<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BevacizumAb is a humanized monoclonal antibody developed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to evaluate the possibility of using serum sTRAIL and IL8 as markers of treatment efficacy and prognosis in patients with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted in Denizli between November 10, 2009 and September 20, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>25 patients (6 female, 19 male) with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> whose mean age was 58.7 years, were selected and included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received therapy with BevacizumAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Clinic of Denizli State Hospital and were evaluated by clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>sTRAIL and IL8 levels were measured by ELISA in the sera of 25 BevacizumAb treated metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients and 20 healthy age-gender matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurements were taken before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum sTRAIL concentrations in patients before therapy were similar to those of healthy age-gender matched controls, namely 1.23 +/- 0.06 ng/mL and 1.21 +/- 0.04 ng/mL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After BevacizumAb treatment, sTRAIL ratios were increased significantly in 11 of 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>14 patients showed progressive disease with median overall survival of only 8.1 +/- 0.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These 14 patients were the same ones who showed no increase in sTRAIL levels after BevacizumAb treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We explored evidence for a correlation between sTRAIL levels and overall survival rates and observed that elevated sTRAIL levels after the BevacizumAb treatment were significantly associated with increased median overall survival up to 22.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Serum IL8 levels were decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who received BevacizumAb therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In BevacizumAb therapy, serum IL8 levels were decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and thus, changes in such levels were not correlated with disease outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest measurement of changes in sTRAIL following BevacizumAb treatment may have prognostic value in metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
