<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to identify preoperative predictors of survival and lung recurrence for patients undergoing resection of such lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospectively collected database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients who underwent their first colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> pulmonary metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify preoperative predictors of survival and lung recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative factors, pathologic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> stage, additional sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, timing of metastatic occurrence, and premetastasectomy disease-free interval were included in the univariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From January 2000 to December 2010, 229 patients met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 60 years, and 100 patients (43.7%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall median time and 5-year survival rate were 70.1 months and 55.4%, respectively, after the first pulmonary metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 37.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.005 to 1.052; p=0.016), male sex (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.089 to 3.094; p=0.023), and more than three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.024 to 1.282; p=0.018) predicted survival at 5 years in one multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the second, more than three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> present at first metastasectomy (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.071 to 1.321; p=0.001) and the preoperative disease-free interval of less than 3 years (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.973 to 0.997; p=0.013) predicted lung recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Older age, male sex, and more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> predict poorer survival after resection of pulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> present at the first metastasectomy and the preoperative disease-free interval predicted recurrence in the lung </plain></SENT>
