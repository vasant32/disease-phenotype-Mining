<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify characteristics that could predict which nodules truly represented a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in an attempt to optimize therapy and to reduce the number of follow-up chest CT scans performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who presented between 2004 and 2008 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> on staging CT were identified from a dedicated prospective database and the medical records analysed and follow up recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with obvious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were excluded from analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association of location, number and size of the nodules and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were the primary end-points for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine hundred and eight patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the colon</z:e> or rectum were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven (4%) patients were diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> with no obvious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> on staging CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a median follow up of 23 months there were eight (21%) cases where nodules had progressed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Half of the patients with four or more nodules showed progression on serial CT imaging suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> (χ(2), P ≤ 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with four or more indeterminate pulmonary nodules on preoperative staging CT imaging, even in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> elsewhere, are likely to represent pulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients should be followed up with short-term interval CT imaging to enable early detection of progression so that treatment can be tailored appropriately </plain></SENT>
