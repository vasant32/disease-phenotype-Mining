<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We choose to test the effect of associating chemo-radiotherapy at 8 h (the highest level of DNA-<z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>) and 48 h (the lower level of DNA-<z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>) to clarify if irradiation at the maximum DNA-<z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> concentration could improve the synergism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Growth inhibition of the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line HCT116 treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, Lipoplatin™ and Lipoxal™ plus gamma-radiation was determined by a colony formation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The synergism was evaluated using the combination index method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For 8 h and 48 h exposure to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> or Lipoplatin™, followed by irradiation, drug concentrations higher than IC(50) were found to be synergistic, while a lower than IC(50) concentration was antagonistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, exposure to a concentration above IC(50) for 8 h was synergistic, while the exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (at any concentrations) for 48 h was antagonistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lipoxal™ significantly improved synergism compared to its parent drugs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The difference of drug concentrations and the time interval between drug administration and radiotherapy could give different results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
