<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 138 patients with middle and low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> were randomly assigned to either the laparoscopic TME (LTME) group or the open TME (OTME) group between September 2008 and July 2011 at the Department of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> of Shanghai <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center, Fudan University and pathological data, as well as surgical technique were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Short-term clinical and oncological outcome were compared in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed in the outpatient clinic 2 wk after the surgery and then every 3 mo in the first year if no adjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were treated with LTME and 71 patients were treated with OTME (sex ratio 1.3:1 vs 1.29:1, age 58.4 ± 13.6 years vs 59.6 ± 9.4 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resection was considered curative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sphincter-preserving rate was 65.7% (44/67) vs 60.6% (43/71), P = 0.046; mean blood loss was 86.9 ± 37.6 mL vs 119.1 ± 32.7 mL, P = 0.018; postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> was 2.1 ± 0.6 d vs 3.9 ± 1.8 d, P = 0.008; duration of urinary drainage was 4.7 ± 1.8 d vs 6.9 ± 3.4 d, P = 0.016, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conversion rate was 2.99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The complication rate, circumferential margin involvement, distal margins and lymph node yield were similar for both procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No port site recurrence, anastomotic recurrence or mortality was observed during a median follow-up period of 21 mo (range: 9-56 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic TME is safe and feasible, with an oncological adequacy comparable to the open approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies with more patients and longer follow-up are needed to confirm the present results </plain></SENT>
