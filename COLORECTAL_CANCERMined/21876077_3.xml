<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Colonoscopy is thought to be a powerful and cost-effective tool to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) incidence and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Empirical evidence for overall and risk group-specific definition of screening intervals is sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> according to time since negative colonoscopy, overall, and by sex, smoking, and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, in a large population-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 1,945 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 2,399 population controls were recruited in 22 hospitals and through population registers in the Rhine-Neckar region of Germany from 2003 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on history of colonoscopy and important covariates were obtained by personal interviews and from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with people who had never undergone colonoscopy, people with a previous negative colonoscopy had a strongly reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted odds ratios for time windows of 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 19, and 20+ years after negative colonoscopy were 0.14 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.20), 0.12 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.19), 0.26 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.39), 0.28 (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.45), and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.66), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low risks even beyond 10 years after negative colonoscopy were observed for both left- and right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk groups assessed except current smokers, who had a risk similar to that of never smokers with no previous colonoscopy 10 or more years after a negative colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results support suggestions that screening intervals for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening by colonoscopy could be longer than the commonly recommended 10 years in most cases, perhaps even among men and people with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but probably not among current smokers </plain></SENT>
