<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the possible association between meat intake, cigarette smoking and N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) genetic polymorphisms on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were matched for gender and age to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Meat intake and cigarette smoking were assessed using a specific frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and the genotypes of the polymorphism were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five NAT2 alleles were studied (WT, M1, M2, M3 and M4) using specific digestion enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 147 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (76 women and 90 men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>) and 212 controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the two groups was 62 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than half the subjects (59.8% in the case group and 51.9% in the control group) were NAT2 slow acetylators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 1.38 (95% CI: 0.90-2.12) in slow acetylators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the number of women was small (n = 76 in the case group), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk was found to be lower in intermediate (W/Mx) acetylators [odds ratio (OR): 0.55, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.29-1.02] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This difference was not observed in men (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.16-2.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among NAT2 fast acetylators (W/W or W/Mx), meat consumption more than 3 times a week increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.01-4.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cigarette smoking increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among slow acetylators (OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.02-3.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was higher among fast acetylators who reported a higher meat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Slow NAT2 acetylation was associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
