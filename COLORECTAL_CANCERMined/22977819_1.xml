<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since colorectal ESD is still associated with higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate, a longer procedure time, and increased technical difficulty, the indications should be strictly considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Generally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> without deep submucosal invasion or minimal possibility of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, for which en bloc resection using conventional EMR is difficult, are good candidates for colorectal ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ideal knife for colorectal ESD should avoid making <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> but can make a clean cut of optimal depth at one time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ideal current for ESD differs depending on the procedure used, the surgical devices used, the tissue to be dissected, and the operator's preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Application of the optimal indications and improvements in the technical skill and surgical devices are required for easier and safer colorectal ESD </plain></SENT>
