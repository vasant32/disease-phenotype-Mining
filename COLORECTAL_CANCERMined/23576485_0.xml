<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about factors associated with receipt of bevacizumab, or whether bevacizamab is associated with increased toxicity when added to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of patients aged â‰¥65 years, which evaluated the association between geriatric assessment (GA) metrics and chemotherapy toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined differences in characteristics and outcomes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a total of 207 patients, 27 (13%) received bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 180 (87%) received chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Groups were similar in sociodemographic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no baseline differences in GA domains except that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> were less likely to receive bevacizumab (4% vs. 26%, p = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight percent of patients who had bevacizumab had grade 3-5 toxicity compared to only 57% who received chemotherapy alone (p = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving bevacizumab were more likely to develop grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than those who received chemotherapy alone (15% vs. 2%, p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, factors associated with grade 3 or more toxicity included: bevacizumab (OR: 2.86, p = .04), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR: 2.54, p &lt; .01), and baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (OR: 2.58, p = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Heart disease</z:e> was more common in those who did not receive bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Older patients who receive bevacizumab with chemotherapy have a higher odds of developing a grade 3-5 toxicity compared with those who receive chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
