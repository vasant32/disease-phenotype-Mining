<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is still unresolved but has been associated with alterations in epithelial clearance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> and metabolic waste products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to functionally characterize the transport of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotides</z:chebi> in colonic biopsies from patients with and without colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">Cyclic nucleotides</z:chebi> were used as model substrates shared by some OATP- and ABC-transporters, which in part are responsible for clearance of metabolites and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> from the colonic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On colonic biopsies from patients with and without colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, molecular transport was electrophysiologically registered in Ussing-chamber set-ups, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of selected transporters was quantified by rt-PCR, and subcellular location of transporters was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotides</z:chebi>, dibuturyl-cAMP induced the largest short circuit current in both patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The induced short circuit current was significantly lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>-patients (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed altered transport of dibuturyl-cAMP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>-patients could not be directly translated to an observed increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of OATP4A1 and OATP2B1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other examined transporters were expressed to similar extents in both patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OATP1C1, OATP4A1, OATP4C1 seem to be involved in the excretory system of human colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ABCC4 is likely to be involved from an endoplasmic-Golgi complex and basolateral location in goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ABCC5 might be directly involved in the turnover of intracellular cAMP at the basolateral membrane of columnar epithelial cells, while OATP2B1 is indirectly related to the excretory system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is associated with lower transport or sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotides</z:chebi> and increased expression of OATP2B1 and OATP4A1 transporters, known to transport <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) </plain></SENT>
