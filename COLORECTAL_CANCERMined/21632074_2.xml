<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were derived, controlling for a series of covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum adiponectin was negatively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (odds ratio, 0.72; confidence interval, 0.53-0.99) and also with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (P = .05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Established positive associations with red meat consumption and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and negative associations with physical exercise and plant food consumption were confirmed along with a more than 60% higher risk associated with central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
