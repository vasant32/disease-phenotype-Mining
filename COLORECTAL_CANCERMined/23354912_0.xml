<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>G1 to S transition is one of the two main checkpoints used by cells to control the cell cycle progress and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G1/S progression is highly regulated by multiple intracellular signaling transduction cascades including Akt and p53 pathways, which therefore becomes a promising target for the development of novel anticancer therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scutellaria barbata D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Don (SB) is a major component in many Chinese medicine formulas that have long been used in China to clinically treat various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> extract of SB (EESB) is able to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via activation of the mitochondrion-dependent pathway and inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> through suppression of Hedgehog signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate the precise mechanisms of its antitumor activity, in the present study we evaluated the effect of EESB on the proliferation of human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> HT-29 cells and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that EESB could inhibit the proliferation of HT-29 cells through blocking the G1/S cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, EESB treatment profoundly promoted antiproliferative p21 expression, but inhibited the expression of pro-proliferative PCNA, cyclin D1 and CDK4 in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the phosphorylation/activation of Akt was significantly suppressed by EESB treatment, whereas that of p53 was enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EESB could effectively induce G1/S arrest in human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells via modulation of multiple cell cycle-related signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
