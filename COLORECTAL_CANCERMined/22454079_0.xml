<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Faecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) are widely used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood-based inflammatory markers have been suggested as alternative or supplementary non-invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 179 CRC patients, 193 people with advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 225 people free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum CD26 (sCD26), complement C3a anaphylatoxin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) levels in blood were measured by ELISA tests, and an immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT) and a guaiac-based FOBT were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed and the areas under the curves (AUCs) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The blood levels of CRP, sCD26 and TIMP-1 showed statistically significant differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>-free participants, and levels of TIMP-1 were furthermore significantly elevated in advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the four inflammatory markers, AUCs ranged from 0.52 to 0.62 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection and from 0.50 to 0.58 for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> detection, compared with AUCs of 0.90 and 0.68 for the iFOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 97% specificity, blood markers showed much lower sensitivities than FOBTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combining inflammatory markers with the iFOBT increased the AUC for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These blood-based markers do not seem to be an alternative to FOBT-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potential use of these and other blood-based tests in combination with iFOBT might deserve further attention </plain></SENT>
