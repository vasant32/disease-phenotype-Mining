<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most physicians report routinely recommending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening, but many eligible patients are not screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand this finding, we explored the relationship between the content of hypothetical patient-physician <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates in physicians' practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Semistructured interviews, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035822,C0699820" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">role-playing</z:e>, with 24 primary care physicians explored their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening approach with average-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qualitative analysis examined physician-reported components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussion, then compared findings between physicians with high (≥60%, n = 16) and low (≤45%, n = 8) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates (based on HEDIS criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted no statistical tests because of the small sample size and its exploratory aims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High screeners used dramatic language (eg, patient stories) and mentioned risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, disability, or surgery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in screening discussion role-plays more often than low screeners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High screeners frequently offered fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy as equally acceptable screening options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High screeners more commonly described solutions for overcoming <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging providers to use risk-specific messaging about the consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, offering screening option choices, and promoting a problem-solving approach to surmount barriers are potential strategies for increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates </plain></SENT>
