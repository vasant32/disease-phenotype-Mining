<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relevance of these markers for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis was performed to assess the predictive and prognostic impact of KRAS and BRAF gene mutation status in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> with bevacizumab (CG) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> without bevacizumab in the phase III AGITG MAX (Australasian Gastrointestinal Trials Group MAX) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mutation status was determined for 315 (66.9%) of the original 471 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation status was correlated with efficacy outcomes (response rate, progression-free survival [PFS], and overall survival [OS]), and a predictive analyses was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutations in KRAS and BRAF genes were observed in 28.8% and 10.6% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS gene mutation status (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> [WT] v mutated [MT]) had no prognostic impact for PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; CI, 0.69 to 1.14) or OS (HR, 0.97; CI, 0.73 to 1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation status (WT v MT) was not prognostic for PFS (HR, 0.80; CI, 0.54 to 1.18) but was prognostic for OS (HR, 0.49; CI, 0.33 to 0.73; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By using the comparison of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and bevacizumab (CB) and CB plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25357">mitomycin</z:chebi> (CBM), KRAS gene mutation status was not predictive of the effectiveness of bevacizumab for PFS or OS (test for interaction P = .95 and 0.43, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, BRAF gene mutation status was not predictive of the effectiveness of bevacizumab for PFS or OS (test for interaction P = .46 and 0.32, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: KRAS gene mutation status was neither prognostic for OS nor predictive of bevacizumab outcome in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BRAF gene mutation status was prognostic for OS but was not predictive of outcome with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
