<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group I comprised 68 patients who underwent planned surgery between January 2002 and January 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group II comprised a sample of 202 patients who underwent surgery between January 2004 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the majority of the parameters measured: postoperative stay, compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis, compliance with the staging study, mortality, rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean length of stay (±standard deviation) for patients without complications was reduced significantly (9.2 ± 3.6 in group I versus 7.7 ± 1.7 in group II, P = .031) </plain></SENT>
