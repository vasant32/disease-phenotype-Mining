<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The correlation of G1249A ABCC2 polymorphism with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and poor prognosis was evaluated in patients who were treated with fluorouracil/-leucovorin (FL) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 50 paraffinâ€‘embedded tissue samples collected from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were analyzed to identify the polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were in stage II/III and received postoperative FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a control group, an equal number of unrelated healthy subjects were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism was genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method, and results were compared with clinicopathological markers, early relapse and survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the 12 months of follow-up, local and distant recurrences were observed in 15 (30%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and polymorphic genotypes was observed between the patient and control groups and between the patients who experienced recurrence within 1 year and those who did not (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the G1249A polymorphism is not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk and early recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, significant correlation was observed between G1249A polymorphism and the overall survival and disease-free survival of the patients </plain></SENT>
