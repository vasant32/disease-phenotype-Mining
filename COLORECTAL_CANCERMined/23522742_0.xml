<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the classical modes offered (imaging or tapping mode) often damage sample that are too soft or loosely immobilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If imaging and mechanical properties are required, it requests long recording time as two different experiments must be conducted independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we compare the new QIâ„¢ mode against contact imaging mode and force volume mode, and we point out its benefit in the new challenges in biology on six different models: Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Chinese hamster ovary cells and their isolated nuclei, and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
