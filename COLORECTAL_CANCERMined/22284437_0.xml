<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the incidence and trend of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in this subgroup with the non South Asian population over a 20-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients of South Asian origin diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from 1989 to 2008 were identified from the hospital histopathology database and compared with those of non South Asian origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1991 and 2001 census data were used to standardize for differing age and sex distributions in the two study populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median unadjusted incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from 1989 to 2008 was 6.17 per 100,000 per year in South Asians compared with 71.70 per 100,000 per year in non South Asians (77.79% white British) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age and sex adjusted odds ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in South Asians was 0.2 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an equal increased trend in the incidence in both the South Asians and non South Asians over the study period (0.8% per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients &lt; 50 years, the gender difference in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was not significant, but as age increased this rose significantly (males &gt; females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a markedly lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in South Asians compared with non South Asians, maintained over 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence increased by a small and similar amount over the period in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a male preponderance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in both populations over 50 years </plain></SENT>
