<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify novel protein biomarkers for the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Proximal fluids are a rich source of candidate biomarkers as they contain high concentrations of tissue-derived proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FabplCre;Apc(15lox/+) mouse model represents early-stage development of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proximal fluids were collected from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> and subjected to in-depth proteome profiling by tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CHI3L1 human serum protein levels were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 2,172 proteins identified, quantitative comparison revealed 192 proteins that were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) and abundantly (&gt;5-fold) more excreted by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than by controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further selection for biomarkers with highest specificity and sensitivity yielded 52 candidates, including S100A9, MCM4, and four other proteins that have been proposed as candidate biomarkers for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening or surveillance, supporting the validity of our approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For CHI3L1, we verified that protein levels were significantly increased in sera from patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> compared with control individuals, in contrast to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biomarker CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data show that proximal fluid proteome profiling with a mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model is a powerful approach to identify candidate biomarkers for early diagnosis of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, exemplified by increased CHI3L1 protein levels in sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> precursor lesions </plain></SENT>
