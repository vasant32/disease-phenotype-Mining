<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we directly estimated red marrow activity concentration and the self-dose component of absorbed radiation dose to red marrow based on PET/CT of 2 different (124)I-labeled antibodies (cG250 and huA33) and compared the results with plasma activity concentration and plasma-based dose estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of patients injected with (124)I-labeled monoclonal antibodies (11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740457" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">renal cancer</z:e> receiving (124)I-cG250 and 5 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> receiving (124)I- huA33) were imaged by PET or PET/CT on 2 or 3 occasions after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regions of interest were drawn over several lumbar vertebrae, and red marrow activity concentration was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma activity concentration was also quantified using multiple patient blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The red marrow-to-plasma activity concentration ratio (RMPR) was calculated at the times of imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The self-dose component of the absorbed radiation dose to the red marrow was estimated from the images, from the plasma measurements, and using a combination of both sets of measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RMPR was observed to increase with time for both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean (±SD) time-dependent RMPR (RMPR(t)) for the cG250 group increased from 0.13 ± 0.06 immediately after infusion to 0.23 ± 0.09 at approximately 6 d after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the huA33 group, mean RMPR(t) was 0.10 ± 0.04 immediately after infusion, 0.13 ± 0.05 approximately 2 d after infusion, and 0.20 ± 0.09 approximately 7 d after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma-based estimates of red marrow self-dose tended to be greater than image-based values by, on average, 11% and 47% for cG250 and huA33, respectively, but by as much as -73% to 62% for individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The hybrid method combining RMPR(t) and plasma activity concentration provided a closer match to the image-based dose estimates (average discrepancies, -2% and 18% for cG250 and huA33, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the assumption of time-independent proportionality between red marrow and plasma activity concentration may be too simplistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Individualized imaged-based dosimetry is probably required for the optimal therapeutic delivery of radiolabeled antibodies, which does not compromise red marrow and may allow, for some patients, a substantial increase in administered activity and thus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dose </plain></SENT>
