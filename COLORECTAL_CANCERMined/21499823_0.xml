<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: National guidelines endorse colonoscopy as the only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening test which prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and evaluates the entire large bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding patient compliance with a screening program that exclusively uses colonoscopy, particularly in an underserved population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Connecticut Department of Public Health provided funds for the total cost of colonoscopies, patient navigators and education of staff and primary care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With cost and provider barriers removed, we were able to examine patient related factors influencing compliance with colonoscopy in an ethnically diverse sample of underinsured adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine what patient related factors are predictors of compliance with screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross sectional retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Underinsured patients (50-64 years) visiting nine Connecticut community health centers (CHCs) were evaluated for medical eligibility for screening; eligible patients were offered a free colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN MEASURES: Patients were deemed non-compliant if they refused, canceled or did not show for the colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> (Body Mass Index ≥ 30), educational attainment, gender, race, ethnicity, previous screening and social ties were examined as primary risk factors for compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Of 424 uninsured patients (62% female, 21% White, 26% Black, 53% Hispanic), 354 were eligible for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among eligible patients, 263 (74.3%) were compliant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> patients were more likely than non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients to be non-compliant with colonoscopy (adjusted odds ratio = 2.16; 95% Confidence interval = 1.20-3.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A high school education was positively correlated with increased compliance social ties such as having a spouse, significant other, family or friend also increased compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an ethnically diverse, uninsured population, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients and patients with lower educational attainment were less likely to comply with free colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These patients require special attention in colonoscopy-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening efforts </plain></SENT>
