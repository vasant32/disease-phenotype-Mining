<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stool-based DNA testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is becoming a favored alternative to existing DNA screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, current methods of analysis often become more complicated and costly with increased sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high-resolution melting assay (HRMA) is a simple and rapid mutation scanning method with low cost and superb accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we verified the accuracy of HRMA for screening KRAS/TP53 mutations in stool-isolated DNA from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparing to direct DNA sequencing, the accuracy of HRMA was verified by detecting KRAS/TP53 mutations in 2 independent stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In study stage I, both tissue and stool samples from colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In study stage II, stool samples from patients with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in clinical screening settings were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In study stage I, the HRMA identified 14 of 17 target mutations (82.4%) in stools from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, and 4 of 5 (80.0%) target mutations in stools from advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutation detection rate in fecal samples (45.0%; 18/40) and referred tissue samples (55.0%; 22/40) was highly consistent (Îº = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HRMA detected 1% mutant DNA in a background of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In study stage II, the HRMA assay detected 58.8% (20/34) mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, 41.5% (17/41) in advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> samples, and 3.33% (2/60) in age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results from HRMA and DNA sequencing revealed 100% sensitivity and specificity in both tissue and stool samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HRMA is a simple, reliable, and sensitive method for detecting DNA mutations in the stool samples from patients with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
