<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The comparison was carried out on 62 examples of genomic DNA extracted from frozen colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, which underwent manual dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results obtained in two attempts were consistent in 95,2% (N=59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specificity and sensitivity of K-ras mutations detection using "KRAS-7M" set were 100 and 96,4% respectively, and 94,1 and 100% respectievly using PCR/SSCP/ACRS/automatic sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>False positive results were absent when detecting with "KRAS-7M" and accounted for 2 cases (5,9%) when using PCR/SSCP/ ACRS/automatic sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only false negative response (3,6%) was obtained analyzing mutations using "KRAS-7M" </plain></SENT>
