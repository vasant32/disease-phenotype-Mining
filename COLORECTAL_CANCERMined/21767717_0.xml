<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lost productivity represents a considerable portion of the total economic burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), but cost-effectiveness studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention and control have not included these costs and therefore underestimate potential savings from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To use microsimulation modeling study to estimate and project productivity costs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and to model the savings from four approaches to reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality: risk factor reduction, improved screening, improved treatment, and a simultaneous approach where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three strategies are implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A model was developed to project productivity losses from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using the U.S. population with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality projected through the year 2020 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality, morbidity, and productivity savings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With 2005 levels in risk factors, screening, and treatment, 48,748 CRC <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in 2010, amounting to $21 billion of lost productivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using prevention and treatment strategies simultaneously, 3586 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> could have been avoided in 2010, leading to a savings of $1.4 billion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulatively, by 2020, simultaneous strategies that reduce risk factors and increase screening and treatment could result in 101,353 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> avoided and $33.9 billion in savings in reduced productivity loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improved screening rates alone led to nearly $14.7 billion in savings between 2005 and 2020, followed by risk factor reduction ($12.4 billion) and improved treatment ($8.4 billion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The savings in productivity loss from strategies to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality are substantial, providing evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention and control strategies are likely to be cost-saving </plain></SENT>
