<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In everyday practice, the use of colonoscopy for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is less effective in the proximal than the distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A potential explanation for this is that proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> have a more subtle endoscopic appearance, making them more likely to be overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences in endoscopic appearance, ie, diminutive size and nonpolypoid shape, of proximal compared with distal colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional, single-center study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Endoscopists at the Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands who were previously trained in the detection and classification of nonpolypoid colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive patients undergoing elective colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Endoscopic appearance, ie, diminutive size (&lt;6 mm) or nonpolypoid shape (height less than half of the diameter) of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (SPs), with a focus on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with advanced histology, ie, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and SPs with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or large size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 3720 consecutive patients with 2106 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 941 SPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that in both men and women, proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n = 181) were more likely to be diminutive or nonpolypoid than distal ones (76.3% vs 26.2%; odds ratio [OR] 9.24; 95% CI, 4.45-19.2; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, 84.4% were diminutive or nonpolypoid compared with 68.0% of the distal ones (OR 2.66; 95% CI, 2.14-3.29; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Likewise, large/dysplastic SPs in the proximal colon were more often nonpolypoid than distal ones (66.2% vs 27.8%; OR 5.51; 95% CI, 2.79-10.9; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Inclusion of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proximal colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with advanced histology frequently are small or have a nonpolypoid appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings support careful inspection of the proximal colon, if quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention with the use of colonoscopy is to be optimized </plain></SENT>
