<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that HER2 (ErbB2; Her-2/neu) and the related PI3K/Akt signaling pathway substantially affect the malignant phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, fatty acid synthase (FASN), which mediates de-novo fatty acid synthesis, is crucially important in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> process of a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the malignant phenotype regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells via the "HER2-PI3K/Akt-FASN axis" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Caco-2 cells with high expression of HER2 and FASN and high transfection efficiency were selected for functional characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cells were transfected with either HER2-specific RNAi plasmid or negative control RNAi plasmid, followed by Q-RT-PCR and western blot assays to examine expression of HER2, PI3K, Akt, and FASN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and colony-formation assays were used to assess proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Migration was investigated by use of the transwell assay, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle were assayed by use of flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of HER2, PI3K, Akt, and FASN were downregulated when HER2 was silenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proliferation decreased after downregulation of HER2, which was consistent with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Migration of HER2-silenced cells was also impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Loss of HER2 inhibits the activity of the "HER2-PI3K/Akt-FASN axis" of Caco-2 cells, and reduced activity of this axis alters the malignant behavior of Caco-2 cells </plain></SENT>
