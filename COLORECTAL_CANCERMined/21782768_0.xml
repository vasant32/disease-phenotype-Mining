<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study of Medicare data to determine the frequency of anesthesiologist involvement and to identify patient and provider characteristics and cost implications associated with anesthesiologist involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare dataset to identify patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> who received a screening colonoscopy examination from July 2001 through 2006 (n = 16,268) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome variable was anesthesiologist involvement, which was identified by searching Medicare claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to explore the association between patient and provider characteristics and anesthesiologist involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs associated with the use of an anesthesiologist were derived based on a cost assessment by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the screening colonoscopies assessed, 17.2% involved an anesthesiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The screening colonoscopy rate more than doubled during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of anesthesiologist involvement increased from 11.0% of screening colonoscopies in 2001 to 23.4% in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgeons involved an anesthesiologist in 24.2% of colonoscopies, compared with 18.0% of gastroenterologists and 11.3% of primary care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of colonoscopies that involved an anesthesiologist varied among regions, ranging from 1.6% in San Francisco to 57.8% in New Jersey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anesthesiologist involvement increased the cost by approximately 20% per screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the involvement of anesthesiologists has significantly increased the cost of screening colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Studies are needed to assess the effects of anesthesiologists on risks and benefits of colonoscopy, to determine the most safe and cost-effective approaches </plain></SENT>
