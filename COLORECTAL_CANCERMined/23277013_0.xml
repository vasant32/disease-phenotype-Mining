<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to determine the global effect of microsatellite instability on the signaling pathways and network in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We profiled the expression and phosphorylation of 110 proteins in six <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines by using Protein Pathway Array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathways and network constituted by these proteins were identified by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that 25 proteins and phosphoproteins change more than 1.5-fold between MSI and microsatellite stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen major pathways were affected in MSI cells, including p53 and 14-3-3ÃŸ pathways, with p53 and HGF being the most important pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, although the EGFR/K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>/MEK pathway was not affected in MSI cells, collateral pathways such as the p70S6K and p90RSK pathways were activated in MSI cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, suppression of the p53 pathway and activation of the HGF pathway in MSI cells may be critical in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
