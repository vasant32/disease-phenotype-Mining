<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Circulating total cytokeratin 18 (tCK18) and/or caspase cleaved cytokeratin 18 (cCK18) (measured by M65 and M30 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), respectively) are used as pharmacodynamic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) biomarkers of epithelial cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Having validated these ELISAs, we assessed their utility in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied the assays in several settings: 53 controls; 97 patients undergoing surgery and 74 patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> undergoing chemotherapy (55 first line; 56 patients with repeated sampling through chemotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognostic significance was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier life tables and Cox models; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> utility was assessed by analysis of repeated measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median cCK18 and tCK18 levels were elevated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (both P=0.0001), and among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, there were increasing trends from early to advanced stages (both P(trends)=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing tCK18 predicted for reduced survival after surgery with curative intent (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for doubling in concentration 1.77, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.01) and after first-line chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> (adjusted HR per doubling in concentration=1.78, 95% CI: 1.37, 2.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with progressive disease during chemotherapy, repeated sampling revealed profiles with high baselines and progressive upwardly increases after cycle 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for cytokeratin 18 (CK18) as a prognostic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> biomarker in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and supports continued deployment of circulating CK18 in biomarker-enhanced trials </plain></SENT>
