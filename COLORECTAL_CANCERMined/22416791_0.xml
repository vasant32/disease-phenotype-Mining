<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine two delivery methods of lay health educators (promotoras de salud) to increase screening behavior and evaluate costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This community-based group randomized trial assigned Latinas due for breast, cervical, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (n=1006) to promotora-taught <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening/prevention classes delivered individually (IND) or in social support groups (SSG) over 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening behaviors were assessed immediately after and 3 and 15 months after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention costs per study arm were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Screening and maintenance behaviors were not significantly different between SSG and IND for any one type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, but with a study entry requirement that participants were either never screened or due for screening, postintervention screening rates (that is, completing a screening that was due) were notable (39.4% and 45.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cost of achieving any one screening was much higher for IND participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SSG vs. IND delivery did not significantly affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening behaviors, but both interventions produced robust achievement of screenings for previously nonadherent participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group-based promotora-led interventions supporting social involvement are recommended as a more cost-effective approach to achieving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening among Latina women </plain></SENT>
