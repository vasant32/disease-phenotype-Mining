<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The study aimed to explore the gender difference in using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) tests among Chinese aged 50 years or over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2004 Chinese older adults through anonymous telephone survey which covered socio-demographic variables, health status, use of complementary therapy, health-related perceptions and use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The uptake rate of flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS)/colonoscopy was 14% for males and 10% for females, with males significantly more likely to have had the test after adjusting for their differences in socio-demographics, health status, use of complementary therapies, health-related perceptions and recommendation received from health professionals (adjusted OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The uptake of fecal occult blood test was nearly the same (19%) for both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further interaction analyses indicates that the effect of a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> on the uptake of a FS/colonoscopy is significantly weaker in males than in females (the interaction odds ratio = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8, p = 0.011), whereas a male perceived that visiting a doctor is good for health will be more likely to have an uptake of a FS/colonoscopy than a female with such perception (the interaction odds ratio = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-3.8, p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tests was low in this average-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More effort is needed to educate the public about the importance and benefits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of the gender differences in some determinants of FS/colonoscopy uptake, particular attention should be given to develop gender-specific strategies to improve the rate </plain></SENT>
