<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, some researchers normalized DNA methylation arrays data in order to remove the technical artifacts introduced by experimental differences in sample preparation, array processing and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, other researchers analyzed DNA methylation arrays without performing data normalization considering that current normalizations for methylation data may distort real differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genomes may be extensively subject to hypomethylation and the total amount of CpG methylation might differ substantially among samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, using eight datasets by Infinium HumanMethylation27 assay, we systemically analyzed the global distribution of DNA methylation changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control and its effect on data normalization for selecting differentially methylated (DM) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We showed more differentially methylated (DM) genes could be found in the Quantile/Lowess-normalized data than in the non-normalized data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found the DM genes additionally selected in the Quantile/Lowess-normalized data showed significantly consistent methylation states in another independent dataset for the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, indicating these extra DM genes were effective biological signals related to the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggested normalization can increase the power of detecting DM genes in the context of diagnostic markers which were usually characterized by relatively large effect sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides, we evaluated the reproducibility of DM discoveries for a particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type, and we found most of the DM genes additionally detected in one dataset showed the same methylation directions in the other dataset for the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type, indicating that these DM genes were effective biological signals in the other dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we showed that some DM genes detected from different studies for a particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type were significantly reproducible at the functional level </plain></SENT>
