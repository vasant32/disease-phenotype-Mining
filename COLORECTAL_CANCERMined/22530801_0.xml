<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Due to the high morbidity and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), this study aims to determine the joint association of RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and nuclear factor-ÎºB 1 (NFKB1) genes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A well-matched case-control study including 390 controls and 388 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was enrolled in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the REST and NFKB1 genes were genotyped by Illumina SnapShot Chip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for important covariates, the associations of SNPs and joint association of REST and NFKB1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were evaluated by multiple logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects with the rs2228991 AA genotype of the REST gene had a decreased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.19-0.74), compared with the GG genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant associations between three SNPs in the NFKB1 gene, their haplotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a significant combined effect of rs3774959 and rs3774964 in the NFKB1 gene with rs2228991 in the REST gene on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study found that mutation in the REST gene rather than the NFKB1 gene was associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significant REST-NFKB1 joint association was observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
