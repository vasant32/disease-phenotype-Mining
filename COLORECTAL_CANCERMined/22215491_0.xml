<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1984 and 2008, 81 patients (age 54.8 years, 50.6% men) underwent 100 PMs with curative intent in Iceland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, information on demographics, number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, type of surgery, and complications were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was estimated with median follow-up of 45 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the three most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, the proportion of patients who underwent PM was calculated using information from the Icelandic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 100 PMs, there were 62 wedge resections, 34 lobectomies, and 4 pneumonectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common complication was persistent air leakage (&gt;96 hour; 11.1%), and operative mortality was 1.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 kinds of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> operated, three were most common: colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, n = 27), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (n = 21), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>, n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients who underwent PM was 1.0% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 6.5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, and 1.4% for <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>, and their 5-year overall survival was 45.2, 18.6, and 38.5%, respectively (p = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 30.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The surgical outcome and survival of patients who underwent PM in Iceland are comparable to those in the other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although there was no control group and selection bias cannot be eliminated, the survival of PM patients was better than for the nonoperated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, a relatively small proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> underwent metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
