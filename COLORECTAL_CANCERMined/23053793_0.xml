<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown that physical inactivity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are risk factors for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, controversy exists regarding the influence of these factors on survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the impact of recreational physical activity and body mass index (BMI) before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis on disease-specific mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 1,339 women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative study who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> subsequent to study enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI and recreational physical activity were measured before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis at study entry (pre-diagnostic) and after diagnosis at study follow-up interviews (post-diagnostic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used Cox regression to estimate the association between pre- and post-diagnostic exposures and survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among women diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 265 (13 %) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred during a median study follow-up of 11.9 years, of which 171 (65 %) were attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with women reporting no pre-diagnostic recreational physical activity, those reporting activity levels of â‰¥18 MET-h/week had significantly lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.68; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.41-1.13) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (HR = 0.63; 95 % CI: 0.42-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar inverse associations were seen for post-diagnostic recreational physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither pre- nor post-diagnostic BMI were associated with mortality after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recreational physical activity before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis, but not BMI, is associated with more favorable survival </plain></SENT>
