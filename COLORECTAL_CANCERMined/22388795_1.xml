<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Many primary studies have considered the association of polymorphisms of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism and response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conclusions from these studies have been conflicting and few have considered large cohorts of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have completed a systematic review and meta-analyses to summarize some of the findings to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted searches for any studies that had addressed the prognostic value of genotype analysis of thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">Methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (DHFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data on the study designs, and completed meta-analyses to pool congruent data about treatment effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A narrative summary is presented for 39 studies that describe three TYMS genotypes and two MTHFR genotypes associated with response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were synthesized from up to 2402 patients for the most commonly studied markers TYMS 5' UTR repeat polymorphism (rs45445694) and MTHFR 677 C&gt;T (rs1801133) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that the TYMS genotype associated with the lowest protein expression (2R/2R) was significantly associated with improved clinical benefit; the pooled risk ratio was relative risk=1.36 [1.11, 1.65]; P=0.003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the same trend was observed for adverse effects; the pooled risk ratio was 2.04 [1.42, 2.95]; P=0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a small but statistically significant association between treatment effect (both intended effects and adverse events) and a TYMS genotype associated with low protein expression; however, the effect size is small and therefore indicates limited clinical utility </plain></SENT>
