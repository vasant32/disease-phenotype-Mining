<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of compounds based on a 4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-2-phenylaminopyridine scaffold that are potent and selective inhibitors of Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) activity are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These compounds were used as tools to test the importance of TNIK kinase activity in signaling and proliferation in Wnt-activated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of TNIK kinase activity has minimal effects on either Wnt/TCF4/β-catenin-driven transcription or viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that the kinase activity of TNIK may be less important to Wnt signaling than other aspects of TNIK function, such as its putative role in stabilizing the TCF4/β-catenin transcriptional complex </plain></SENT>
