<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we generated CIK cells ex vivo from blood lymphocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and engineered those cells with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with an antibody-defined specificity for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CIK cells thereby gained a new specificity as defined by the CAR and showed increase in activation towards CEA⁺ colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells, but less in presence of CEA⁻ cells, indicated by increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Redirected CIK activation was superior by CAR-mediated CD28-CD3ζ than CD3ζ signaling only </plain></SENT>
