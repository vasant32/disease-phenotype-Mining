<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basis for consideration is what we know about the variant of the disease the patient is suffering from, and about the mechanisms influencing the plasma concentration-time profile, such as activity of metabolizing enzymes and transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, drugs are currently selected regarding molecular properties of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue, eg, expressing receptors such as HER2 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently diagnostic tests are available allowing to detect somatic cell mutations that can be used to guide drug selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and developing resistance by further mutations may limit the success of the therapy determined by molecular diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present status can be described that in drug kinetics we know the influencing factors and we understand the mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, only in a few cases the genetic background is the main determinant of kinetic variability, and environmental and other factors have an additional important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, much more has to be done before we can translate the accumulating knowledge into a benefit for the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only then, we can speak about personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
