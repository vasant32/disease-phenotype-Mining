<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD133 is one of the most commonly used <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stem cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its specificity is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that the AC133 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of CD133, not the CD133 protein, is responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of AC133 expression in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two antibodies against CD133, including AC133 and Ab19898, were compared for their expression characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AC133 was chosen for further immunohistochemical assessment on 176 stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> with at least 12 examined lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cutoff value for positive rate of AC133 expression was determined by ROC curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AC133 was analyzed for correlations with clinicopathological and prognostic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that AC133 was negative in adjacent noncancerous colorectal mucosa while positive in 116 cases (65.9 %) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AC133 expression was significantly correlated with preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level (p = 0.006) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation grade (p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, high AC133 expression was identified as a significant predictor for poor disease-free survival and overall survival at both univariate (p = 0.009, 0.013, respectively) and multivariate levels (p = 0.022, 0.026, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that AC133 is an independent adverse prognostic factor and a potential marker for survival classification in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
