<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> are driven by an activation of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway, which promotes the expression of multiple target genes mediating proliferation inavasion and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upon activation of the Wnt signalling pathway its key player β-catenin translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and binds to members of the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF-1) family namely LEF-1 and TCF4 which are central mediators of transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the expression of β-Catenin, LEF1 and TCF4 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and their prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical analyses of LEF-1, TCF4 and nuclear β-Catenin were done using a tissue microarray with 214 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression patterns were compared with each other and the results were correlated with clinicopathologic variables and overall survival in univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LEF-1 expression was found in 56 (26%) and TCF4 expression in 99 (46%) of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and both were heterogeneously distributed throughout the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing LEF-1, TCF4 and β-catenin expression patterns we found no correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, TCF4 expression turned out to be a negative prognostic factor being associated with shorter overall survival (p = 0.020), whereas LEF-1 expression as well as a LEF-1/TCF4 ratio were positive prognostic factors and correlated with longer overall survival (p = 0.015 respectively p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, LEF-1 and TCF4 expression were confirmed to be independent predictors of longer respectively shorter overall survival, when considered together with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage, gender and age (risk ratio for LEF-1: 2.66; p = 0.027 risk ratio for TCF4: 2.18; p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates different prognostic values of LEF-1 and TCF4 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients indicating different regulation of these transcription mediators during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover both factors may serve as new potential predictive markers in low stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cases in advance </plain></SENT>
