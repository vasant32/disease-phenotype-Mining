<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> after EMR of colorectal lesions is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a critical need for imaging methods to accurately diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> and to guide retreatment in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to estimate and compare the accuracy of virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE) and probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) for detection of residual neoplastic tissue at the site of prior EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, blind, pilot comparison of advanced endoscopic imaging (VCE and pCLE) by using matching histology as reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Three tertiary-care referral hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved 92 participants who underwent follow-up colonoscopies for the evaluation of prior EMR sites within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The EMR scars were assessed during follow-up high-resolution colonoscopy by using VCE (narrow-band imaging/Fujinon Intelligent Color Enhancement [FICE]), and pCLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Confocal videos of EMR scars were interpreted in real time and were also stored and reviewed offline, blinded to histopathology and endoscopic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue confirmation by biopsies or polypectomy/repeat EMR was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for VCE and pCLE alone and in combination against histopathology as the standard reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 129 EMR scars, residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was confirmed by histology in 29 sites (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For VCE, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were 72%, 77%, 49%, 91%, and 77%, respectively, and were 97%, 77%, 55%, 99%, and 81% for pCLE (P = .045 for sensitivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When only EMR scars for which VCE and pCLE agreed on the diagnosis were analyzed (95/129 scars), the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, and NPV of pCLE and VCE were 90%, 100%, 87%, 67%, and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, lack of power, involvement of highly experienced pCLE experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Confocal endomicroscopy significantly increases the sensitivity for detecting residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> after colorectal EMR compared with endoscopy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When confocal endomicroscopy is used in combination with VCE, the accuracy is extremely high, and sensitivity approaches that of histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Together, they may reduce the need for histologic examination and allow a highly accurate on-table decision to treat again or not, thus avoiding unnecessary repeat procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>(Clinical trial registration number: 00874263.) </plain></SENT>
