<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Combined chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin (LV) has been widely used for the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that LV effects are attributable to increased levels of reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, we attempted here to show the in vivo role of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), which stabilizes intracellular reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, in the anticancer activities of oral fluoropyrimidines, UFT or S-1, combined with LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, HCT-15 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells were knocked down for FPGS expression by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell line stably expressing FPGS shRNA (FPGS shRNA HCT-15) was cloned and transferred subcutaneously into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice fed a low-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FPGS shRNA HCT-15 tumors expressed a significantly lower level of FPGS at protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels than parental HCT-15 cells, and the levels of reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> in FPGS shRNA HCT-15 tumors became 57% of those in parent after a single administration of 10 mg/kg of LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, FPGS downregulation did not affect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> or sensitivity to fluoropyrimidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we observed that LV given for 14 days failed to enhance the anticancer effects of UFT and S-1 in FPGS shRNA HCT-15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was in keeping with the results that LV did not increase the ternary complex of TS, FdUMP and reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present results provide in vivo evidence that intratumor FPGS plays an important role in the efficacy of oral fluoropyrimidine plus LV therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
