<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were prospectively to undergo laparoscopic-assisted (n=12) or open (n=21) surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte and lymphocyte counts were used to calculate the G/L ratios in blood samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before the operation and post-operatively on days 1, 3 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, serum inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and macrophage (M)-CSF were assayed as markers of surgical stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 33 patients developed unexpected complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-6 (P&lt;0.0001), G-CSF (P=0.0257), and M-CSF (P&lt;0.0001) were higher on day 1 vs before the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the G/L ratios were higher on days 1-3 vs before the operation (P&lt;0.0001) and then gradually decreased together with the surgical stress levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The G/L ratios and the numbers of granulocytes and lymphocytes in the blood showed no correlation with serum IL-1β or TNF-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the G/L ratios and the numbers of granulocytes in the blood showed significant correlation with IL-6 (Rs=0.710, P&lt;0.0001, Rs=0.653, P&lt;0.0001, respectively), with G-CSF (Rs=0.626, P&lt;0.0001, Rs=0.578, P&lt;0.0001), with M-CSF (Rs=0.470, P&lt;0.0001, Rs=0.372, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the number of lymphocytes showed inverse correlation with IL-6 (Rs=-0.493, P&lt;0.0001), G-CSF (Rs=-0.440, P&lt;0.0001) and M-SCF (Rs=-0.443, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The G/L ratio appears to be a simple and clinically relevant parameter for the assessment of perioperative stress in patients undergoing colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
