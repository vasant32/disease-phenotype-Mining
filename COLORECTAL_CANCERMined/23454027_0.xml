<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It primarily affects middle aged men, and is associated with 4-fold increased mortality as compared to age- and gender-matched population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Progressive biliary and hepatic damage results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> in a significant majority of patients over a 10-15 year period from initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> in 70% patients, and increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> almost 10-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite significant research efforts in this field, the pathogenic mechanisms of PSC are still incompletely understood, although growing evidence supports the role of genetic and immunologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are no proven medical therapies that alter the natural course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, liver transplantation is the only available treatment for patients with advanced PSC, with excellent outcomes in this population </plain></SENT>
