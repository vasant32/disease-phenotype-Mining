<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of true axial computed tomography on the accuracy of staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fifty consecutive datasets were independently assessed by three radiologists, experienced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first read was of standard axial images only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second read was 6 weeks later and true axial images, through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and perpendicular to its long axis, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall accuracy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> staging was 56% for reader 1, 48% for reader 2 and 64% for reader 3 for standard axial CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This improved to 72% (p = 0.012), 66% (p = 0.012) and 80% (p = 0.021) when the true axial images were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For nodal staging, overall accuracy improved from 56% to 70% (p = 0.065) for reader 1, 58% to 76% (p = 0.012) for reader 2 and 60% to 76% (p = 0.021) for reader 3 between reads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The accuracy of CT staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic tumours</z:e> is significantly improved by reviewing images reconstructed in a plane perpendicular to the long axis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The accuracy achieved by this analysis is similar to that of CT colonography but avoids the extra complexity, additional cost and increased complications </plain></SENT>
