<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subcellular localization and functional activation of p53 are influenced by diverse stress signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>p53 in cytoplasm exerts intrinsic 3'→5' exonuclease activity with various <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ssRNAs containing an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>-rich (ARE) element are permissive targets for p53-mediated degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the exonuclease activity in cytoplasm with activated p53 induced by various drug treatments or following γ-irradiation revealed that the expression of p53 exonuclease activity in response to stress signals is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various genotoxic and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxic agents</z:chebi> upregulate p53 yet have different effects on expression of exonuclease activity with ARE <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> but not with DNA substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ribonuclease activity is enhanced in cytoplasmic extracts of HCT116 (p53+/+) cells exposed to γ-irradiation or treated by the non-genotoxic drug AS101 but decreased following treatment by genotoxic (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>) or non-genotoxic (e.g., DFMO) agents, thus indicating that p53 exonuclease activity is dependent on the specific stress and nature of the substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apparently, the disparity in expression of p53 ribonuclease activity after each treatment is attributable to the different post-treatment response and to two posttranscriptional events: the interaction of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding HuR protein with ARE <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> protects the substrate from degradation by p53 and/or decrease in p53 ARE <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> binding capacity due to phosphorylation at Ser392 leads to reduction in p5 ribonuclease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide new insights into p53 exonuclease function and into the mechanisms behind the regulation ARE-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> degradation by p53 under different cellular conditions </plain></SENT>
