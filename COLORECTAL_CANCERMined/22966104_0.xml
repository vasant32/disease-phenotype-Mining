<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE More effective strategies are needed to improve rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, particularly among the poor, racial and ethnic minorities, and individuals with limited English proficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the direct mailing of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) kits to patients overdue for such screening is an effective way to improve screening in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adults aged 50 to 80 years who did not have documentation of being up to date with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening as of December 31, 2009, and who had had at least 2 visits to the community health center in the prior 18 months were randomized to the outreach intervention or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the outreach group were mailed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> fact sheet and FOBT kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the usual care group could be referred for screening during usual clinician visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was completion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (by FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy) 4 months after initiation of the outreach protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were compared using the Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Analyses were based on 104 patients assigned to the outreach intervention and 98 patients assigned to usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 30% of patients in the outreach group completed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening during the study period, compared with 5% of patients in the usual care group (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the screenings were by FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The groups did not differ significantly with respect to the percentage of patients making a clinician visit or the percentage for whom a clinician placed an order for a screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS The mailing of FOBT kits directly to patients was efficacious for promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among a population with high levels of poverty, limited English proficiency, and racial and ethnic diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-visit-based outreach to patients may be an important strategy to address suboptimal rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among populations most at risk for not being screened </plain></SENT>
