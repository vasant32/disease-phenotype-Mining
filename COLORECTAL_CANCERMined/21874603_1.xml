<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to reflect the "risk" in a disease-free population, rates should both exclude prevalent cases from the denominator and second or later diagnosed cases at the same site from the numerator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were evaluated through a correction method using 2005-2007 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data to determine the extent of difference between conventional and corrected incidence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These corrections lowered the incidence rates 4.0-5.8% for female <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, 4.6-7.6% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, 3.0-4.0% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and 2.1-2.5% for lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007121" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bronchus cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corrected incidence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> were 9.9-13.7% higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with either high prevalence and/or high occurrence of multiple primaries at the same site, corrected population-based incidence rates are warranted </plain></SENT>
