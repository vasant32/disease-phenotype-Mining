<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three polymorphisms, which are excision repair cross-complementation 1 (ERCC1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043346" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">xeroderma pigmentosum</z:e> group D (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e>) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), were assessed in 257 postoperative stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with 5-fluorouracial chemotherapy in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the correlations between genetic polymorphisms and patients' clinicopathological features were investigated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who carried <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> AA and ERCC1 TT genotypes demonstrated a significantly greater regional recurrence risk (OR = 5.625, 95% CI, 1.557-20.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inherited variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> and ERCC1 was associated with outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the significant association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms has not been studied previously in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, these findings suggest novel sites of variation, in part explaining the range of treatment responses seen in this disease </plain></SENT>
