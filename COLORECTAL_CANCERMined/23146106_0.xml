<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Presence of CTCs was evaluated in 60 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients before systemic therapy--from which 33 patients were also evaluable for CTC analysis during the first 3 months of treatment--through immunomagnetic enrichment, using the antibodies BM7 and VU1D9 (targeting mucin 1 and EpCAM, respectively), followed by real-time RT-PCR analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated genes KRT19, MUC1, EPCAM, CEACAM5 and BIRC5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were stratified into groups according to CTC detection (CTC negative, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> marker genes were negative; and CTC positive when at least one of the marker genes was positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with CTC positivity at baseline had a significant shorter median progression-free survival (median PFS 181.0 days; 95% CI 146.9-215.1) compared with patients with no CTCs (median PFS 329.0 days; 95% CI 299.6-358.4; Log-rank P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a statistically significant correlation was also founded between CTC detection during treatment and radiographic findings at the 6 month staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This correlation applied to CTC results before therapy (odds ratio (OR), 6.22), 1 to 4 weeks after beginning of treatment (OR, 5.50), 5 to 8 weeks after beginning of treatment (OR, 7.94) 9 to 12 weeks after beginning of treatment (OR, 14.00) and overall CTC fluctuation during the course of treatment (OR, 20.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence of a strong correlation between CTC detection and radiographic disease progression in patients receiving chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that in addition to the current prognostic factors, CTC analysis represent a potential complementary tool for prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients' outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the present test allows for molecular characterization of CTCs, which may be of relevance to the creation of personalized therapies </plain></SENT>
