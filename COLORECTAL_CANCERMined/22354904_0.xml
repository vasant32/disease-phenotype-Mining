<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a case-control study nested within the Multiethnic Cohort, we attempted to replicate associations for five genetic variants associated with IGF system biomarkers, insulin, or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and to examine their association with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a subset of participants, the association between circulating biomarkers and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for genetic variants (1,954 cases/2,587 controls) and serum biomarkers (258 cases/1,701 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Associations with circulating biomarkers were replicated in the Multiethnic Cohort for IGF1 rs35767 and for IGFBP3 rs2854744, rs2854746, and rs3110697 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homozygous carriers of the glucokinase regulator (GCKR) rs780094 variant T-allele were at a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In risk factor-adjusted models, participants with the highest prediagnostic IGF-II levels were at an increased risk [OR (T1 vs. T3), 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09-2.28; P(trend) = 0.011] and participants with the highest prediagnostic IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 levels were at a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34-0.83; P(trend) = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data provide further support for a role of prediagnostic IGF and insulin levels in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Future studies attempting to replicate the association between the GCKR rs780094 variant and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are warranted </plain></SENT>
