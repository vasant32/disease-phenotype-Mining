<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adequacy of lymph node sampling is fundamental to the accuracy of nodal status (N-status) assessment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the minimum sampling number to achieve reliable prognosis and to look for any association between the positive lymph node ratio (LNR) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathological reports of 533 stages I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who underwent curative resection during the period from January 1998 to December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed with regard to the number of lymph nodes obtained for pathological diagnosis (nLN) and number of positive nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median nLN was 10 nodes and the mean number of positive nodes was 1.7 nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the N-status attribution plot, the cut-off point where the converging curves turned parallel was at 12 nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This cut-off was supported by the significant difference in OS between cases with nLN ≥���12 (5-year OS 73.0%) and those with nLN &lt; 12 (5-year OS 62.7%), (P-value &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that both nLN-12 and LNR were independent factors predicting survival probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data emphasize the importance of lymph node harvesting during the surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, LNR is a strong independent factor associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
