<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50629">cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors</z:chebi> has been proven in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Meloxicam is a selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50629">cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor</z:chebi> with pH-dependent solubility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To achieve pH-independent drug release of meloxicam, pH modifying agents (buffering agents) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meloxicam tablets containing <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> were dually coated with ethyl cellulose containing hydrophilic material, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> as an inner coating layer and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37080">acrylate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="34840">methyl methacrylate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25219">methacrylic acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> (Eudragit® FS 30D) as outer coating layer for colon targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Optimized tablet formulations demonstrated good potential to deliver the drug to the colon by successfully exhibiting a lag time of 5 h during in vitro drug release study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An in vivo evaluation study conducted to ascertain pharmacokinetic parameters in rabbits revealed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of drug absorption from the coated tablets (T(lag time) = 4.67 ± 0.58 h) was significantly delayed compared to that from the uncoated tablets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AUC(0→)(t) and AUC(0→∞) for coated tablets were lower than of uncoated tablets, although the difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The roentgenography study revealed that the tablet remained intact, until it reached the colon (5 h), which demonstrates that the system can efficiently deliver the drug to the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that a meloxicam-loaded colon targeted system exhibited promising targeting and hence may be used for prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
