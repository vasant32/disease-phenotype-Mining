<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only very few studies have studied the effect of palliative chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) and no data are present incorporating biological therapies in the treatment of PC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : By means of merging with the regional Eindhoven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients diagnosed with synchronous PC of colorectal origin since the year 2000 treated with palliative chemotherapy in our hospital were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on chemotherapeutic agents used were collected retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of biological therapies on survival was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Fifty consecutive patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapeutic treatment consisted mainly of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 22 patients biological therapies were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 12.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 9.2-15.5] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients receiving chemotherapy in combination with a biological therapy, overall survival was significantly prolonged as compared with those treated without (18.2 months, 95% CI, 9.5-27.0 vs. 10.1 mo, 95% CI, 6.2-14.1, respectively; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of survival of patients receiving biological therapies in first-line treatment was even more pronounced, being 22.4 months (95% CI, 15.0-29.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar effects were observed on progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : Systemic chemotherapy, once regarded as futile in patients suffering from PC, resulted in an overall survival of 12 months in this unselected group of PC-patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Addition of biological therapies in the first line of treatment prolonged overall survival to 22.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although the results of this small study should be interpreted with caution, this promising finding warrants further research </plain></SENT>
