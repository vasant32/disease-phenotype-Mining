<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To generate large-scale evidence on whether the CHEK2 1100delC variant is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility we have conducted a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from the following electronic databases: PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, with the last report up to November 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to assess the strength of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the contrast of carriers versus non-carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis was performed in a fixed/random effect model by using the software Review Manager 4.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of six studies including 4194 cases and 10,010 controls based on the search criteria were involved in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant association of the CHEK2 1100delC variant with unselected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was found (OR=2.11, 95% CI=1.41-3.16, P=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found an association of the CHEK2 1100delC variant with familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR=2.80, 95% CI=1.74-4.51, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the association was not established for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR=1.45, 95% CI=0.49-4.30, P=0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis demonstrates that the CHEK2 1100delC variant may be an important <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-predisposing gene, which increases <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
