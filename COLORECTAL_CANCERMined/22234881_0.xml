<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As GSTs are involved in the detoxification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi>, CNVs may modify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk associated with smoking exposure and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk associated with GSTT1 and GSTM1 CNVs and their interaction with smoking in 1,796 cases and 1,806 age-, sex- and residence-matched controls from a German population-based case-control study (DACHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interaction with MHT was assessed in the subset of 684 postmenopausal female cases and 681 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trimodular genotypes (0/0, 1/0 and 1/1) were determined with relative quantification based on multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk as well as possible effect modifications were evaluated using conditional logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CNVs of GSTT1 and GSTM1 were not significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the 1/1 genotype, odds ratios (ORs) for the 0/1 genotype and the 0/0 genotype were 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-1.04] and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.80-1.18) for GSTT1, and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.78-1.27) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.81-1.31) for GSTM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the non-null genotype, ORs for the null-genotype were 1.04 (95% CI: 0.87-1.23) for GSTT1 and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.91-1.18) for GSTM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant interaction with smoking and MHT use was observed </plain></SENT>
