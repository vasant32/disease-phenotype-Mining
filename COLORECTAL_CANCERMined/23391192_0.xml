<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A better understanding of patients' views on the benefit and burden obtained from palliative chemotherapy would facilitate shared decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated palliative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients' reported outcomes (PROs) for toxicity and investigated the survival threshold for which they would repeat chemotherapy (CTx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who had received a minimum of three months of palliative CTx for advanced colorectal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) or non-colorectal (non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: upper gastrointestinal, lung and head-and-neck) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were assessed by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were questioned about PROs for toxicity, subjective burden from side effects, and were asked for the survival threshold necessary for them to repeat CTx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expected survival (sum of indicated survival threshold and median survival time with best supportive care) was compared to the patients' actual survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: 58; non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: 76) were surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent PRO- grade 3/4 toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> (12.8%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (9.0%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The symptom causing the highest subjective burden was <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and was worse than expected in 29.9% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival threshold for which patients would repeat CTx was significantly longer in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median expected survival was significantly longer than actual median survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: 44.0 months [22.0-65.9] compared with 30.0 months of actual survival [20.9-39.1]; non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: 22.0 months [15.3-28.6] compared with 19.0 months of actual survival [15.1-22.9], p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> deserves more attention when toxicity of treatment and symptoms of disease are explained to patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients' survival expectations from palliative chemotherapy are higher than previously described, exceed the median survival time known from phase III trials, and are significantly longer than their actual survival </plain></SENT>
