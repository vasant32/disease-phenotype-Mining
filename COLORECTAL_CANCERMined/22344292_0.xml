<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Component-wise boosting algorithms have evolved into a popular estimation scheme in biomedical regression settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The iteration number of these algorithms is the most important tuning parameter to optimize their performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, no fully automated strategy for determining the optimal stopping iteration of boosting algorithms has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We propose a fully data-driven sequential stopping rule for boosting algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It combines resampling methods with a modified version of an earlier stopping approach that depends on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e>-based information criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The new "subsampling after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e>" stopping rule is applied to component-wise gradient boosting algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The newly developed sequential stopping rule outperformed earlier approaches if applied to both simulated and real data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, it improved purely <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e>-based methods when used for the microarray-based prediction of the recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> for stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proposed sequential stopping rule for boosting algorithms can help to identify the optimal stopping iteration already during the fitting process of the algorithm, at least for the most common loss functions </plain></SENT>
