<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: miR-18a is one of the most up-regulated miRNAs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) based on miRNA profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the functional significance of miR-18a in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of miR-18a was investigated in 45 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential target genes of miR-18a were predicted by in silico search and confirmed by luciferase activity assay and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA damage was measured by comet assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene function was measured by cell viability, colony formation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The up-regulation of miR-18a was validated and confirmed in 45 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> compared with adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Through in silico search, the 3'UTR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> mutated (ATM) contains a conserved miR-18a binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of ATM was down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (p&lt;0.0001) and inversely correlated with miR-18a expression (r = -0.4562, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of miR-18a in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells significantly reduced the luciferase activity of the construct with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ATM 3'UTR but not that with mutant ATM 3'UTR, inferring a direct interaction of miR-18a with ATM 3'UTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was further confirmed by the down-regulation of ATM protein by miR-18a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As ATM is a key enzyme in DNA damage repair, we evaluated the effect of miR-18a on DNA double-strand breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of miR-18a significantly inhibited the repair of DNA damage induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.001), leading to accumulation of DNA damage, increase in cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and poor clonogenic survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: miR-18a attenuates cellular repair of DNA double-strand breaks by directly suppressing ATM, a key enzyme in DNA damage repair </plain></SENT>
