<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: EphB2 is a transmembrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, and the role of EphB2 protein in tumorogenesis has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the influence of mutation of A9 region in EphB2 gene in the prognosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 473 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A9 region in exon 17 of EphB2 was amplified using specific primer and analyzed using Genescan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EphB2 mutation was detected in 13 of the 473 patients (2.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation of EphB2 showed association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, 12 of 13 mutations were proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EphB2 mutation confers better prognosis in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> group; 100% of patients carrying the mutation survived and were disease free after 72 months (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low frequency of EphB2 gene, we got promising results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It would be very interesting to increase the population size to verify our results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If these findings are confirmed, EphB2 could help discriminate patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with different prognosis and to improve the election of the most suitable treatment in each case </plain></SENT>
