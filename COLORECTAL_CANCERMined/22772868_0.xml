<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathologic outcomes of patients with surgical treatment after endoscopic resection for T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from 275 patients who had undergone curative resection for T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at a single institution between 1991 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the rationale for additional surgical treatment after endoscopic resection performed on 68 of the 275 patients and the association between various clinicopathologic features and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 96.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reasons for additional surgical treatment included an endoscopic specimen with a pathologically positive margin (n = 20), lymphovascular invasion (n = 25), and submucosal invasion depth of ≥ 1,000 μm (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When endoscopists failed to find macroscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> residue during endoscopic resection, no pathologically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual cancer</z:e> was found in the resected specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologic grade was an independent risk factor for lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the absence of lymphovascular invasion, patients with well-differentiated T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> did not have nodal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the outcomes of patients with additional surgical treatment after endoscopic resection for T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were satisfactory, excessive and unnecessary treatments may have been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional surgical treatment after endoscopic resection for T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> might be unnecessary for patients with well-differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and no lymphovascular invasion </plain></SENT>
