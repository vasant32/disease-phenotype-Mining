<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding which detection method can be applied in a reproducible, sensitive, and simple manner in the routine diagnostic setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the detection rates of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in 92 routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens by 2 discrete methods: direct sequencing and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48021">peptide nucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>)-mediated PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection rates for KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations by direct sequencing were 20.7%, 3.3%, and 1.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>-mediated PCR clamping significantly increased the percentages of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations by up to 7.6%, 1.2%, and 5.4%, respectively, compared to the detection rate of regular PCR followed by direct sequencing (p=0.039, p=0.250, and p=0.031, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume of discordant cases was not significantly different from concordant cases (56.2±28.7% vs. 67.6±17.9%, p=0.41), which implies that there is a minor population of mutant alleles in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>-mediated PCR clamping method is highly sensitive and is efficiently applicable to the detection of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
