<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of interest, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> is likely to impose a greater risk on men than on women, which indicates that the association of insulin and the IGF axis with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> may differ by gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, epidemiological evidence for this possible gender difference is limited to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured plasma concentrations of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, IGF-I and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) 1 and 3 in 1520 healthy volunteer examinees who underwent total colonoscopy between February 2004 and February 2005, and cross-sectionally investigated the association of these biomarkers with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> by gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An unconditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> after adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a positive association of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and IGF-I (P (trend)&lt;0.001 and 0.02, respectively) and an inverse association of IGFBP-1 (P (trend)=0.002) with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted ORs of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> for the highest compared with the lowest quartile were also statistically significant for C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (OR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.71-4.01), IGF-I (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.08-2.46) and IGFBP-1 (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.32-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no measurable association was seen in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Corresponding ORs for C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, IGF-I and IGFBP-1 were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.56-1.71), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.44-1.43) and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.60-1.86), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gender difference was statistically significant for C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (P (interaction)=0.03) and marginally significant for IGF-I and IGFBP-1 (P (interaction)=0.14 and 0.12, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that insulin and the IGF axis act differently by gender in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, at least in its early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study further our understanding of the complexities of the gender difference in the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
