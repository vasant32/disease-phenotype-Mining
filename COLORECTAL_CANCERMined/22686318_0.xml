<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types in an area of former coal, iron, and steel industries, which was found to display an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>N-Acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) genotypes were investigated in 108 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cases, 80 rectum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases, and 188 controls (suffering from nonmalignant diseases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, in a pilot study, 28 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were NAT2 phenotyped by the <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possible occupational and nonoccupational risk factors were investigated by a personal interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of rapid NAT2 genotype was 35% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cases, 47% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> cases, and 42% in controls (GSTM1 0/0 genotype: 53, 46, and 47%, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the pilot study the frequency of the rapid NAT2 phenotype was 49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only major professional group with an elevated risk was painters (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> OR 2.48, 95% CI 0.4-15.23; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> OR 5.65, 95% CI 1.06-30.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to early studies, in the present study the slow NAT2 status is overrepresented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is associated with nutrition and physical activity, present findings may be due to excessive physical heavy work and the resulting nutrition in this area </plain></SENT>
