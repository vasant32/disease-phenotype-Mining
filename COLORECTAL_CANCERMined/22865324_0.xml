<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the KRAS gene has been identified as a reliable strong negative predictor for the response to targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and the use of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies such as Cetuximab and Panitumumab is now restricted to patients with no detectable KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 30 and 40 % of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> contain a mutated KRAS oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate concordance between three methods to analyze KRAS mutational status in regard to clinical testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 in one hundred formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples by three different methods: Direct Sequencing and two commercial kits on allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (KRAS StripAssay, Vienna Lab.) and Amplification Refractory Mutation System/Scorpions (ARMS/S; TheraScreen KRAS Mutation kit DxS) based on q-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have found similar frequencies of KRAS mutations by TheraScreen and Strip-Assay (44 and 48 %), with a κ value of 0.90, indicating almost perfect agreement between methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency by direct sequencing was much lower (26 %) and the κ values were 0.67 (compared to TheraScreen) and 0.57 (compared to Strip-Assay) indicating low sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On analyzing KRAS mutation in FFPE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, direct sequencing sensitivity is too low to be used in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Choosing between ARMS/S; TheraScreen KRAS Mutation kit DxS and KRAS StripAssay, Vienna Lab, will depend on laboratory facilities and expertise </plain></SENT>
