<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and 5 volunteers were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hepatic artery proper and the portal vein were imaged simultaneously with dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The examination was repeated with 2 different contrast bolus volumes (1.2 and 2.4 mL), and time-intensity curves were formed from dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound image loops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rise time, peak intensity, and wash-in slope were derived from hepatic artery and portal vein time-intensity curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inter-reader, intra-reader, and inter-scan agreement was assessed by 2 independent readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative (intraclass correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation [CVs]) and qualitative (Landis and Koch classification) analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intra-reader and inter-reader agreement was "almost perfect" for the hepatic artery (CV, 10%-15% and 8%-9%, respectively), portal vein (CV, 5%-8% and 6%-12%), and hepatic artery/portal vein ratio (CV, 8%-14% and 10%-15%) measurements of 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, inter-scan agreement was only "slight" to "moderate" (CV, 25%-27%) and "fair" to "moderate" (CV, 19%-24%) for rise time and peak intensity measurements in the hepatic artery and portal vein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative assessment of altered hepatic hemodynamics with dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound is reproducible provided that measurements in the hepatic artery are normalized by those in the portal vein </plain></SENT>
