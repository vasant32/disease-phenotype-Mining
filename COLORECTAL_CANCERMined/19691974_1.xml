<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish a simple and effective model of primary culture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> fragments and to test whether it allows prediction of chemosensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> fragments (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>) of 94 consecutive and previously untreated patients were obtained, prepared, and cultured in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53537">polyHEMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each fragment cultured, a proliferative index (PI) was calculated after immunostaining at d 0 and after 7 d in culture with media alone or supplemented for 24h with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50276">topoisomerase I inhibitor</z:chebi> metabolite SN-38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation between in vitro response (decrease in PI after exposure to the drug) and in vivo response (RECIST criteria) was studied in a subset of patients who had measurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and were treated with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50276">topoisomerase I inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53537">PolyHEMA</z:chebi> allowed three-dimensional culture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> fragments up to 7 d without fibroblastic invasion and with a slight but significant decrease of PI (59% at d 0 versus 51% after 7 d in culture, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro drug efficacy was tested in 67 fragments, the mean PI after culture with SN-38 dropped to 22% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 12 patients, there was no statistically significant correlation between in vitro and in vivo response (P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Primary culture in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53537">polyHEMA</z:chebi> was easy to perform successfully in 71% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On this model, the antiproliferative effect of SN-38 could be measured and results correlated to clinical data </plain></SENT>
