<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression levels of FOXO1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein, and phosphorylation levels became significantly lower than those of their control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FOXO1 was down-regulated mainly in the cytoplasm, while the nuclear FOXO1 level became relatively high compared to the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the unphosphorylated active form of FOXO1 increased in the cells, cyclin D1/p21/p27 were up-regulated at either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of the cells was also greatly inhibited when miR-223 was over-expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therein, our data suggest that miR-223 regulates FOXO1 expression and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
