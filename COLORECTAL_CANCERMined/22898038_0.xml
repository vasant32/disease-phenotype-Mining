<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relation between progression-free survival (PFS), post-progression survival (PPS) and overall survival (OS) in trials of modern (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>- and irinotecan-based) chemotherapy alone or with targeted therapies for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated surrogacy of PFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A PubMed search identified 34 randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We split the OS, PFS and PPS and evaluated the correlation between OS and either PFS or PPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median PPS and PFS were 10.75 and 8.4 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials, PPS was strongly associated with OS [regression coefficient (R2)=0.8; Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r)=0.88], whereas PFS was moderately associated with OS (R2)=0.43; r=0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In trials with targeted therapies, the correlation of PPS with OS was 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials, correlation between differences in median PFS (ΔPFS) and median OS (ΔOS) is 0.59 (P=0.0007), confirming PFS/OS surrogacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that in recent first-line, phase III, trials, OS becomes more associated with PPS than PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, improvements in PFS are strongly associated with improvements in OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this setting so, PFS may be an appropriate surrogate for OS </plain></SENT>
