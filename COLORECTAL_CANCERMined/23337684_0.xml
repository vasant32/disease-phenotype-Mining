<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is safe, but there have been hesitations to implement the technique in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the reasons for this may be suboptimal learning possibilities since supervised trainees have not been allowed to do the operations to an adequate extent for the technique to spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We routinely plan <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> operations as laparoscopic procedures and most cases are done by supervised trainees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study therefore presents the results of operations performed by trainees compared with results obtained by experienced laparoscopic surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery in 2009 were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgeries performed by laparoscopic inexperienced surgeons were compared with the outcome of surgery performed by laparoscopic experienced surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were also compared with nationwide data extracted from the national database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A university teaching department of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 131 patients underwent colorectal elective surgery in 2009 in the department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 131 operations, 60% were performed by trainees supervised by experienced laparoscopic colorectal surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The trainees performed a total of 70% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonic procedures and 43% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rectal resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between the inexperienced and experienced laparoscopic surgeons with regards to short-term outcome other than increased duration of surgery for colonic resections (198 vs 140 min, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, we found no difference regarding length of stay, conversion to laparotomy, intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or complications, postoperative complications, or 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> can be performed safely by supervised trainees with good short term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a high volume of operations with an educational potential can easily be maintained when going from open to laparoscopic surgery as the standard operative technique for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a university department of surgery </plain></SENT>
