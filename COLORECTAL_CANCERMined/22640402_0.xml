<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Saffron extract, a natural product, has been shown to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the p53-dependency of saffron's mechanism of action in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to examine saffron's anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, we treated two p53 isogenic HCT116 cell lines (HCT <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> and HCT p53-/-) with different doses of the drug and analyzed cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> viability and crystal violet assays were performed in order to determine the effective dose of saffron on both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle progress was examined by Flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was assessed using Annexin-PI-staining and Western Blotting for caspase 3 and PARP cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autophagy was determined by Western Blotting of the light chain 3 (LC3)-II and Beclin 1 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protein content of phospho-H2AX (γH2AX), a sensor of DNA double strand breaks, was also analyzed by Western Blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Saffron extract induced a p53-dependent pattern of cell cycle distribution with a full G2/M stop in HCT116 p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it induced a remarkable delay in S/G2 phase transit with entry into mitosis in HCT116 p53 -/- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic Pre-G1 cell fraction as well as Annexin V staining and caspase 3 cleavage showed a more pronounced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction in HCT116 p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Obviously, the significantly higher DNA-damage, reflected by ɣH2AX protein levels in cells lacking p53, was coped by up-regulation of autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The saffron-induced LC3-II protein level was a remarkable indication of the accumulation of autophagosomes, a response to the cellular stress condition of drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study showing the effect of saffron in HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells with different p53 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Saffron induced DNA-damage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, autophagy has delayed the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HCT116 p53 -/- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Considering the fact that most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> show a functional p53 inactivation, further research is needed to elucidate the long-term effects of saffron in p53 -/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
