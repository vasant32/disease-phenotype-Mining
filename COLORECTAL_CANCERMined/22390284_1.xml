<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate is an important quality indicator for colonoscopy, but recently, serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of the large bowel have been recognized as important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As they are often more difficult to see than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, the detection rate of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> is set to become a more stringent indicator of quality in colonoscopy than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we aim to provide preliminary data on serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopies were stratified by one of six colorectal surgeons, each of whom had performed more than 1000 colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exams were separated by indication and the number of patients with at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or one serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time of withdrawal in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> examinations was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen thousand and three colonoscopies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average completion rate was 96.3 ± 1.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean serrated detection rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examinations was 20.6 ± 4.8% and for screening examinations only was 13.9 ± 5.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Corresponding means for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection were 31.5 ± 6.7% and 20.7 ± 4.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Simple regression of overall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate versus overall serrated detection rate was not significant (R = 0.571, P = 0.237), but was significant for screening exams (R = 0.854, P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a strong relationship between time of withdrawal and serrated detection rate (screening, R = 0.908, P = 0.012; overall, R = 0.956, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taking time to withdraw the colonoscope is essential for maximum detection of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The ability to find <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> does not necessarily correlate with an ability to find serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
