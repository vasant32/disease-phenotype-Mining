<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper examines the influence of sociocultural factors on adherence to fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A survey was conducted among a sample of 400 low-income Hispanics in East Harlem, New York </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fatalism and health literacy were both significantly associated with colonoscopy screening adherence in bivariate models, though fatalism became non-significant and health literacy became less significant in multivariable models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With respect to adherence to colonoscopy or FOBT, both fatalism and health literacy were associated in bivariate models, though only fatalism remained significant in multivariable models (p=.03; OR: .94; 95% CI: .881-.992) </plain></SENT>
