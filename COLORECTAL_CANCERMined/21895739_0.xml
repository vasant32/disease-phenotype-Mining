<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:   Studies have adopted a biomedical framework to measure quality of life and symptom distress following surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that symptoms of pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, may persist for many months following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fewer studies have considered the individual's experiences and perspective of the emotional, social and cultural aspects of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:   A longitudinal study using grounded theory was conducted with 12 individuals, who had received surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semi-structured interviews were conducted at four time points over 1 year following surgery, between 2007 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grounded theory analysis was undertaken using Strauss and Corbin's framework </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS:   Recovery is described in three phases: disrupting the self; repairing the self; restoring the self </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The core category is Restoring a sense of wellness; fostered through awareness and enjoyment of the physical, emotional, spiritual and social aspects of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A sense of wellness exists as a duality with a sense of illness, where both perspectives may co-exist but one usually takes precedence </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   Recovery takes time and energy, particularly when the individual is at home and in relative isolation from health professionals </plain></SENT>
