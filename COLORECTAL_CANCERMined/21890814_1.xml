<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, daily soluble aspirin significantly reduced recurrence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the results of daily intake of low-dose aspirin on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> recurrence at 4-year follow-up are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 272 patients (naive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> aspirin use) with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were randomly assigned to treatment with lysine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13719">acetylsalicylate</z:chebi> 160 mg/day (n=73) or 300 mg/day (n=67) or placebo (n=132) for 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoints were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> burden at year 4, comparing aspirin at either dose with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same endpoints were also assessed at year 1 or 4 (last colonoscopy performed for each patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the final year 4 colonoscopy the analysis included 185 patients (55 receiving aspirin 160 mg/day, 47 aspirin 300 mg/day and 83 placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the proportion of patients with at least one recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> between patients receiving aspirin at either dose and those treated with placebo (42/102 (41%) vs 33/83 (40%); NS) or in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> burden (3.1 ± 5.8 mm vs 3.4 ± 6.2 mm; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, the proportion of patients with at least one advanced recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> did not differ (10/102 [corrected] (10%) in the aspirin group vs 7/83 (8.4%) [corrected] in the placebo group; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Daily low-dose aspirin decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence significantly at 1 year but not at year 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy might be explained by a differential effect of aspirin according to the natural history of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
