<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the extent of radiation induced regression in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> varies widely between individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date no reliable predictive marker of radiation sensitivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, radiation injury initiates a complex molecular network of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways that leads to cell cycle arrest, attempts at re-constituting the damaged DNA and should this fail, then <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review presents the details which suggest the roles of DNA mismatch repair proteins, the lack of which define a distinct subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> with microsatellite instability (MSI), in the DDR pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence routine assessment of the MSI status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> may potentially serve as a predictor of radiotherapy response, thereby improving patient stratification in the administration of this otherwise toxic treatment </plain></SENT>
