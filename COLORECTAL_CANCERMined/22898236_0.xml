<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is a common disease, and incidence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates are higher in medically underserved populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate in Arkansas exceeds the national rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine population characteristics relevant to the design and implementation of a state-sponsored <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening program that is responsive to medically underserved populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Trained interviewers in 2006 conducted a random-digit-dialed telephone survey comprising items selected from the Health Information National Trends Survey to characterize demographic factors, health care variables, and colorectal screening history in a sample (n = 2,021) representative of the Arkansas population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses identified associations among population characteristics and screening status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants who were aged 50 to 64, who did not have health insurance, or who had an annual household income of $15,000 or less were significantly less likely than their counterparts to be in compliance with screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those who reported having a health care provider, having 5 or more health care visits during the past year, and receiving physician advice for colorectal screening were more likely to be in compliance with screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although a larger percentage of white participants were in compliance with screening guidelines, blacks had higher screening rates than whites when we controlled for screening advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survey results informed efforts to decrease disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in Arkansas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Efforts should focus on reimbursing providers and patients for screening costs, encouraging the use of physicians as a point of entry to screening programs, and promoting a balanced approach (ie, multiple options) to screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our methods established a model for developing screening programs for medically underserved populations </plain></SENT>
