<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients submitted to liver resection for CRCLM between January 2000 and October 2007 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clinical risk score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>; range, 0-5) was calculated for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> isolates, and using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies, we assessed the quantitative expression of 12 genes with potential importance in chemotherapy resistance and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, including thymidylate synthase (TS; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>), excision repair cross complementing gene-1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043346" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">xeroderma pigmentosum</z:e> groups A through G (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>), topoisomerase-I (irinotecan), c-met, and hepatocyte growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and disease-specific survival (DSS) after hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred fifty-five patients with good quality <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 32 months for survivors, and the median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven patients (56%) received preoperative chemotherapy, and 124 (80%) received postoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 13 months, and 3-year DSS was 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and 3-year DSS for patients with an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> (3-5) was lower (7 vs 18 months [P &lt; .0001] and 50% vs. 80% [P &lt; .0001], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 genes studied, only increased TS expression was associated with a lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.3; P = .03) and DSS (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.5; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and 3-year DSS for patients with increased TS expression was decreased (9 vs. 15 months [P = .03] and 48% vs. 82% [P = .001], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TS expression had prognostic value that was independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with hepatic CRCLM treated with resection and modern chemotherapy, increased expression of TS improves outcome stratification and appears to be a useful biomarker </plain></SENT>
