<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The detection of circulating nucleosomes (cNUCs) in the peripheral blood may be a diagnostic modality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated changes of modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> tails in blood circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the correlation between the trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me3), which are hallmarks of pericentric heterochromatin, and cNUCs in healthy subjects and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of cNUCs was measured using the Cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Detection ELISA kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">Histone</z:chebi> methylation marks were detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), followed by quantitative PCR with pericentric satellite 2 as the target sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed a high variation in the concentrations of cNUCs, with healthy subjects exhibiting the lowest levels (median 0.194), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients intermediate (median 0.25) and the MM patients the highest levels (median 0.648) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the differences between the groups did not reach statistical significance (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis using the Pearson's correlation test revealed a significant positive correlation between the concentration of cNUCs and H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 in the whole study group (N=57, p&lt;0.001 for both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> marks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A study of the correlation between cNUCs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> marks in the individual study groups demonstrated the correlation between cNUCs and H3K9me3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients to be weak (p=0.046), indicating that circulating H3K9me3 may be modified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> marks were normalized using the values of cNUCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the weak correlation between cNUCs and H3K9me3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, H3K9me3 levels (median 0.047) were lowest in this group compared with the other two groups (0.06 in healthy subjects, 0.2 in MM patients, p = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For H4K20me3, the median values were 0.022 in healthy subjects, 0.052 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and 0.056 in MM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings indicate a marked correlation between cNUCs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> marks </plain></SENT>
