<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (HT29) and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (HepG2) cells were treated with spray-dried extracts of Phyllanthus niruri (SDEPN) either alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> at different concentrations (0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL) for 4 h and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To verify and quantify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells treated with these products as well as identify the cell cycle stage and cell viability, we stained the cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> and assessed them by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells in different cell cycle phases was quantified and data were expressed as histograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between groups were determined using analysis of variance and Bonferroni's test, as indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A value of P &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SDEPN had significantly different cytotoxic effects on HT29 (2.81 ± 0.11 vs 3.51 ± 1.13, P &gt; 0.05) and HepG2 (5.07 ± 0.3 vs 15.9 ± 1.04, P &lt; 0.001) cells when compared to control cells for 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SDEPN also had significantly different cytotoxic effects on HT29 (1.91 ± 0.57 vs 4.53 ± 1.22, P &gt; 0.05) and HepG2 (14.56 ± 1.6 vs 35.67 ± 3.94, P &lt; 0.001) cells when compared to control cells for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines were killed by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent manner compared to control cells (HepG2 cells for 4 h: 10.78 ± 1.58 vs 53.89 ± 1.53, P &lt; 0.001; 24 h: 8.9 ± 1.43 vs 62.78 ± 1.87, P &lt; 0.001 and HT29 cells for 4 h: 9.52 ± 0.913 vs 49.86 ± 2.89, P &lt; 0.001; 24 h: 11.78 ± 1.05 vs 53.34 ± 2.65, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In HT29 cells, pretreatment with SDEPN and subsequent treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> resulted in a greater number of cells being killed (12.78 ± 1.01 vs 93.76 ± 1.6, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HepG2 cells showed significant cell killing with treatment with SDEPN when combined with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> (12.87 ± 2.78 vs 78.8 ± 3.02, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SDEPN is selectively toxic against two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SDEPN in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> induces a synergistic increase in the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of both HT29 and HepG2 cells </plain></SENT>
