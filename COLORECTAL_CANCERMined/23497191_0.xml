<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since specific KRAS mutations confer different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviors</z:hpo>, the prognostic role of prevalent KRAS mutations was retrospectively evaluated in MCRC pts treated with first line FIr-B/FOx, associating BEV to triplet chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> samples were screened for KRAS codon 12, 13 and BRAF V600E mutations by SNaPshot and/or direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCRC pts &lt;75-years-old were consecutively treated with FIr-B/FOx: weekly 12 hour-timed-flat-infusion/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (900 mg/m2 on days 1,2, 8, 9, 15, 16,22, 23), irinotecan plus BEV (160 mg/m2 and 5 mg/kg, respectively, on days 1,15); and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (80 mg/m2, on days 8,22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pts were classified as liver-limited (L-L) and other/multiple metastatic (O/MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared using the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-nine pts were evaluated at a median follow-up of 21.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutant pts: c.35 G &gt; A, 15 (25.4%); c.35 G &gt; T, 7 (11.8%); c.38 G &gt; A, 3 (5%); other, 3 (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, 31 pts (52.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The objective response rate (ORR), PFS and OS were, respectively: c.35 G &gt; A mutant, 71%, 9 months, 14 months; other than c.35 G &gt; A mutants, 61%, 12 months, 39 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OS was significantly worse in c.35 G &gt; A pts compared to KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (P = 0.002), KRAS/BRAF <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (P = 0.03), other MCRC patients (P = 0.002), other than c.35 G &gt; A (P = 0.05), other codon 12 (P = 0.03) mutant pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OS was not significantly different compared to c.35 G &gt; T KRAS mutant (P = 0.142) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KRAS c.35 G &gt; A mutant status may be significantly associated with a worse prognosis of MCRC pts treated with first line FIr-B/FOx intensive regimen compared to KRAS/BRAF <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and other than c.35 G &gt; A mutant pts </plain></SENT>
