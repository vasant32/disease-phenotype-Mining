<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic search was performed, covering the last decade, following the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) for patient and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated after resection in relationship to a margin width &gt;1 cm (R0 &gt; 1 cm) and between 1 mm and 1 cm (R0 &lt; 1 cm) using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-regression was applied for covariate adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven observational studies were identified involving 2823 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 59.1% of patients were R0 &lt; 1 cm and 40.9% were R0 &gt; 1 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis showed that compared with patients with margins R0 &gt; 1 cm, a R0 &lt; 1 cm margin lead to decreased 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS with a RR of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.27), 1.38 (95% CI 1.16-1.65), and 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.91), respectively, but patient survival was obviously affected (P &gt; .05 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with margins of R0 &lt; 1 cm differ from those with R0 &gt; 1 cm for greater proportions of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (RR 1.43; 95% CI 0.25-1.61) and synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> (RR 1.42; 95% CI 0.8-1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meta-regression showed that these two covariates had a significant impact on DFS but not on patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A resection margin width &gt;1 cm is desirable even if patient survival is at best only slightly affected by subcentimeter margin as a consequence of a decreased DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and synchronous bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> represent potential study selection biases that significantly decrease DFS; well-conducted, matched analyses consequently are essential to clarify the issue </plain></SENT>
