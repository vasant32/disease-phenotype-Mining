<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the objective responses obtained by Y microsphere treatment when combined with contemporary chemotherapy in the front-line (first or second line) setting in patients with CRCLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: This study used an in vivo comparison between the right and left liver lobes; systemic chemotherapy was supplied to both liver lobes by virtue of systemic administration, whereas SIRT was administered selectively to the target liver lobe only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment was evaluated by serial fludeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography computed tomography performed at 4 weeks, 2 to 4 months, and 6 to 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard uptake value, anatomic volume, functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume, and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) calculations were obtained at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: A decrease in TLG on fludeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography computed tomography imaging was seen in 19 of the 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean decrease in TLG values in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> receiving chemo-SIRT and chemo-only treatment were 86.26%±18.57% and 31.74%±80.99% (P&lt;0.01), 93.13%±11.81% and 40.80%±73.32% (P=0.01), and 90.55%±19.75% and 54.91%±38.55% (P&lt;0.01) at 4 weeks, 2 to 4 months, 6 to 8 months posttreatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional and anatomic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume changes were in concordance with the TLG changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: The study demonstrated that, under near identical conditions in terms of patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics, the chemo-SIRT combination produced superior objective responses compared with chemo-only treatment in a front-line treatment setting in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
