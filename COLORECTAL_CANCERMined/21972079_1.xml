<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this issue of the journal, Cai and colleagues (beginning on page 1572) and Khalid-de Bakker and colleagues (beginning on page 1563) present new information about the one-time test performance of FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FIT will have a growing appeal to providers and health care systems as resources for clinical preventive services shrink and as incentives to expand colorectal screening rates increase, but there are good reasons to be cautious about the temptation to organize new FIT screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colorectal screening has two potential objectives: To find <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in an earlier, more-treatable stage and to find and remove <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> from forming in the first place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, even advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, do not bleed, tests designed to identify occult blood in the stool are better for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, whereas direct endoscopic visualization of the colorectum is better for prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even if advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> did commonly bleed, low compliance with repeat annual testing will seriously erode the benefit of FIT </plain></SENT>
