<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of two key proteins in the pathway, APC and β-catenin, have been implicated in a range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of Wnt signalling has been associated with the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and consequential up-regulation of β-catenin/TCF gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2003, Lee et al. constructed a computational model of Wnt signalling supported by experimental data from analysis of time-dependent concentration of Wnt signalling proteins in Xenopus egg extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent studies have used the Xenopus quantitative data to infer Wnt pathway dynamics in other systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a basis for understanding Wnt signalling in mammalian cells, a confocal live cell imaging measurement technique is developed to measure the cell and nuclear volumes of MDCK, HEK293T cells and 3 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines and the concentrations of Wnt signalling proteins β-catenin, Axin, APC, GSK3β and E-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These parameters provide the basis for formulating Wnt signalling models for kidney/intestinal epithelial mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are significant differences in concentrations of key proteins between Xenopus extracts and mammalian whole cell lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher concentrations of Axin and lower concentrations of APC are present in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Axin concentrations are greater than APC in kidney epithelial cells, whereas in intestinal epithelial cells the APC concentration is higher than Axin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computational simulations based on Lee's model, with this new data, suggest a need for a recalibration of the model.A quantitative understanding of Wnt signalling in mammalian cells, in particular human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> requires a detailed understanding of the concentrations of key protein complexes over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Simulations of Wnt signalling in mammalian cells can be initiated with the parameters measured in this report </plain></SENT>
