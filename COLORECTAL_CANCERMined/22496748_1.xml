<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of the most important and challenging problems in biomedicine and genomics is how to identify the disease genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed a computational method to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-related genes based on (i) the gene expression profiles, and (ii) the shortest path analysis of functional protein association networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The former has been used to select differentially expressed genes as disease genes for quite a long time, while the latter has been widely used to study the mechanism of diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the existing protein-protein interaction data from STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes), a weighted functional protein association network was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) approach, six genes were identified that can distinguish the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent colonic tissues from their gene expression profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, according to the shortest path approach, we further found an additional 35 genes, of which some have been reported to be relevant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and some are very likely to be relevant to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the genes we identified from both the gene expression profiles and the functional protein association network have more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genes than the genes identified from the gene expression profiles alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides, these genes also had greater functional similarity with the reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> genes than the genes identified from the gene expression profiles alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these indicate that our method as presented in this paper is quite promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The method may become a useful tool, or at least plays a complementary role to the existing method, for identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has not escaped our notice that the method can be applied to identify the genes of other diseases as well </plain></SENT>
