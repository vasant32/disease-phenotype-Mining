<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> registry in Newfoundland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 529 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from Newfoundland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were recruited from 1999 to 2003 and followed up until April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURE: Participants reported their dietary intake using a food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dietary patterns were identified with factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were employed to estimate HR and 95% CI for association of dietary patterns with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes, after controlling for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Disease-free survival (DFS) among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was significantly worsened among patients with a high processed meat dietary pattern (the highest vs the lowest quartile HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No associations were observed with the prudent vegetable or the high-sugar patterns and DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association between the processed meat pattern and DFS was restricted to patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (the highest vs the lowest quartile: HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.40) whereas the relationship between overall survival (OS) and this pattern was observed among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> only (the highest vs the lowest quartile: HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.03 to 4.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Potential effect modification was noted for sex (p value for interaction 0.04, HR 3.85 for women and 1.22 for men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The processed meat dietary pattern prior to diagnosis is associated with higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> recurrence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
