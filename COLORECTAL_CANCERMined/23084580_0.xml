<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite an overall decrease in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> incidence, rates of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> have increased substantially in patients aged less than 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several authors have characterized morphologic features of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in young patients, with variable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, there has been 1 detailed molecular and immunohistochemical study in young patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to expand the data regarding young patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> by a detailed assessment of morphologic features and by assaying expression of p27, COX-2, MLH1, and MSH2, markers with prognostic or therapeutic implications in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We searched our pathology database from 1985 to 2009 and, after exclusion of cases with insufficient data or neoadjuvant therapy, identified a study population of 23 patients aged 40 or younger, 35 patients between 41 and 49 years of age, and a control group of 83 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients aged 50 or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Younger patients had higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (P = .0085), with a trend toward mucinous differentiation and lymphovascular and perineural invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of MSH2 was more prominent in younger patients (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of p27 expression was not associated with age, but was associated with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage (P = .0278), mucinous/signet ring differentiation (P = .0185), loss of either MLH1 or MSH2 (P = .0035), and larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (P = .0019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward lower COX-2 expression in younger patients, with less COX-2 expression relative to previously published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings support some prior reports regarding morphologic features in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in young patients and provide novel data on expression of several markers in this population </plain></SENT>
