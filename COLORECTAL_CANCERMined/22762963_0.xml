<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has improved survival in both the adjuvant and advanced disease settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, improvements have come with substantial increases in expense to the community and potential toxicity to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There has been substantial research to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> that predict treatment response and survival outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This research has identified clinically useful predictive biomarkers to aid clinical decision making, such as the presence or absence of KRAS gene mutations which can determine the benefit of using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibiting antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, less attention has been paid to the identification and impact of predictive patient-derived factors such as age, gender and the presence of comorbid conditions or evidence of a systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this article, the current concepts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and patient-related predictive factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> management are reviewed </plain></SENT>
