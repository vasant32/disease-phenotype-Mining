<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published data on the association between CYP1A1 (MspI and Ile ( 462 ) Val) polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address these issues, we carried out a meta-analysis of available case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Online electronic searches of PubMed were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 17 studies (6,673 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 8,102 control subjects) that examined the association between CYP1A1 (MspI and Ile ( 462 ) Val) polymorphisms and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism, we performed a meta-analysis from 13 studies including 5,468 cases and 6,492 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was no statistically significant association between CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analyses based on ethnicities, no statistically significant associations were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With respect to CYP1A1 Ile ( 462 ) Val polymorphism, a total of 14 studies including 6,654 cases and 7,859 controls were involved in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CYP1A1 Ile ( 462 ) Val polymorphism was associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ethnic subgroup analyses revealed that significant associations were found in Asians and Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that CYP1A1 Ile ( 462 ) Val polymorphism was a low-penetrance susceptibility gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism does not seem capable of modifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
