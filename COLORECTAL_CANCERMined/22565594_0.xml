<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity is a serious consequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, which occurs with some of the most commonly used chemotherapies(1,2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> produces symptoms of numbness and paraesthesia in the limbs and may progress to difficulties with fine motor skills and walking, leading to functional impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to producing troubling symptoms, chemotherapy-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> may limit treatment success leading to dose reduction or early cessation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathic symptoms may persist long-term, leaving permanent nerve damage in patients with an otherwise good prognosis(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As chemotherapy is utilised more often as a preventative measure, and survival rates increase, the importance of long-lasting and significant neurotoxicity will increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There are no established neuroprotective or treatment options and a lack of sensitive assessment methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Appropriate assessment of neurotoxicity will be critical as a prognostic factor and as suitable endpoints for future trials of neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current methods to assess the severity of chemotherapy-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> utilise clinician-based grading scales which have been demonstrated to lack sensitivity to change and inter-observer objectivity(4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conventional nerve conduction studies provide information about compound action potential amplitude and conduction velocity, which are relatively non-specific measures and do not provide insight into ion channel function or resting membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, prior studies have demonstrated that conventional nerve conduction studies are not sensitive to early change in chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity(4-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In comparison, nerve excitability studies utilize threshold tracking techniques which have been developed to enable assessment of ion channels, pumps and exchangers in vivo in large myelinated human axons(7-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nerve excitability techniques have been established as a tool to examine the development and severity of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity(10-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comprising a number of excitability parameters, nerve excitability studies can be used to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity arising immediately following infusion and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, cumulative neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nerve excitability techniques are feasible in the clinical setting, with each test requiring only 5 -10 minutes to complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nerve excitability equipment is readily commercially available, and a portable system has been devised so that patients can be tested in situ in the infusion centre setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, these techniques can be adapted for use in multiple chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In patients treated with the chemotherapy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, primarily utilised for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, nerve excitability techniques provide a method to identify patients at-risk for neurotoxicity prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nerve excitability studies have revealed the development of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e> in motor and sensory axons(10-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Importantly, patients who demonstrated changes in excitability in early treatment were subsequently more likely to develop moderate to severe neurotoxicity(11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, across treatment, striking longitudinal changes were identified only in sensory axons which were able to predict clinical neurological outcome in 80% of patients(10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These changes demonstrated a different pattern to those seen acutely following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> infusion, and most likely reflect the development of significant axonal damage and membrane potential change in sensory nerves which develops longitudinally during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> treatment(10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Significant abnormalities developed during early treatment, prior to any reduction in conventional measures of nerve function, suggesting that excitability parameters may provide a sensitive biomarker </plain></SENT>
