<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the therapeutic potential of TL-118, a new anti-angiogenic drug combination, for CRLM treatment, in a mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The therapeutic potential of TL-118 was evaluated and compared with B20-4.1.1 (B20; anti-VEGF antibody) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> in CRLM-bearing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour progression</z:e> and the vascular changes were monitored by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, mice survival, cell proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and vessel density were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study demonstrated an unequivocal advantage to TL-118 therapy by significantly prolonging survival (threefold) and reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> perfusion and vessel density (ninefold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanism for TL-118-treatment success was associated with hepatic perfusion attenuation resulting from reduced nitric-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) serum levels as elucidated by using hemodynamic response imaging (HRI, a functional MRI combined with <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, systemic hepatic perfusion reduction during the initial treatment phase by adding NO inhibitor has proven to be essential for reaching maximal therapeutic effects for both TL-118 and B20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TL-118 harbours a potential clinical benefit to CLRM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the reduction of hepatic perfusion at early stages of anti-angiogenic therapies by adding NO inhibitor is crucial for achieving maximal anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> effects </plain></SENT>
