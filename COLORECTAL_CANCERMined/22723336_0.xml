<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the exigencies of a personalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> program, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from patients with advanced chemorefractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were analyzed for specific aberrations (KRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA mutations, PTEN and pMET expression) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During 2010 and 2011, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> molecular analysis was conducted in 254 patients: KRAS mutations (80 of 254, 31.5%), BRAF mutations (24 of 196, 12.2%), PIK3CA mutations (15 of 114, 13.2%), KRAS and PIK3CA mutations (9 of 114, 7.9%), low PTEN expression (97 of 183, 53.0%), and high pMET expression (38 of 64, 59.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 68 patients received 82 different MTAs: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitor (if PIK3CA mutation, n = 10; or low PTEN, n = 32), PI3K pathway inhibitor plus MEK inhibitor (if KRAS mutation, n = 10; or BRAF mutation, n = 1), second-generation anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibodies (if <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS, n = 11), anti-hepatocyte growth factor monoclonal antibody (if high pMET, n = 10), mTOR inhibitor plus anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor monoclonal antibody (if low PTEN, n = 5), and BRAF inhibitor (if BRAF mutation, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time-to-treatment failure on MTA was 7.9 versus 16.3 weeks for their prior systemic antitumor therapy (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial response was seen in 1 patient [1.2%, PI3K inhibitor with PIK3CA mutation] and stable disease &gt;16 weeks in 10 cases (12.2%) </plain></SENT>
