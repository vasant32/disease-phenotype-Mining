<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening practices in that population and the factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Evaluate 1) the proportion of patients with HIV who had any type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening and 2) whether having a primary care physician (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) or seeking care in an integrated care practice is associated with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cross-sectional chart abstraction study of patients with HIV enrolled in the Philadelphia Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: MMP participants age 50 and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN MEASURES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening defined as having a documented colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema, or fecal occult blood test after the age of 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Out of 123 chart abstractions performed, 115 had a complete clinical record from MMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the population was male (71.3%), Black/Hispanic (73.8%) and between the age of 50 and 59 (71.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>45.2% of patients did not have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall proportion of patients who received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was 46.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Having a documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> was the only factor strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rates of screening were 66.7% among those with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> versus 28.5% among those without a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> (χ(2) p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for race, socioeconomic status, substance and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e>, the odds of getting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in those with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> was 4.59 (95% CI 2.01-10.48, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The type of practice where patients were enrolled into care was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> significantly increases the likelihood of receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in patients with HIV </plain></SENT>
