<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has been shown to increase the detection of early-stage disease and reduce mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current HEDIS measures for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening include fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this analysis was to quantify the use of CT colonography (CTC) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and demonstrate the potential impact of including CTC as a HEDIS-acceptable screening modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographic and health care utilization data from the Military Health System Population Health Portal for January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2010, for individuals aged 50 to 75, were analyzed to determine the degree of overall utilization of CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening compliance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> per HEDIS was also estimated, and the incremental impact of adding HEDIS-eligible patients who had undergone CTC as their only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test was then evaluated for two similarly sized, regional Navy medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites (10 Army, 4 Navy, 3 Air Force), 17,187 CTC studies were performed, with increasing utilization during the 6-year study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the two Navy medical centers, screening compliance ranged from 33.8% to 67.9% without CTC and from 33.8% to 84.0% with CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTC is actively being used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening across military treatment facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of CTC as a HEDIS-compliant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test has the potential to significantly increase health care system compliance for National Committee for Quality Assurance <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening measures </plain></SENT>
