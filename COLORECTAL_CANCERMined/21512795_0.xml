<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the quality of life of the patients operated for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> 5 years after the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using detailed questionnaires, we investigated 220 patients of both sexes (mean age 66.5 years) 5 years (or more) after a curative operation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CRC">cancer of the large bowel</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The short form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire took into consideration several aspects concerning work activity, physical activity, psychological attitude, alimentation, familial relationships, and other relevant components of lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we compared the perception of the so-called SF-36 score between our patients and a comparison group in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both univariate and multivariate analysis were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The obtained results revealed that familial and social relations were equally unchanged or tended to improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sexual activity declined in only 61(31.3%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rather surprisingly (because of the average age at diagnosis), work activity remained unchanged in about half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the SF-36 questionnaire, the main differences from the general Italian population were seen in bodily pain (especially in the few individuals in whom a permanent stoma was necessary), social functioning and general physical health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion the results seem to suggest that the majority of patients who survive for more than 5 years after an operation for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> return to an almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The awareness among individuals about their disease, the improvements in surgical techniques and medical treatments are among the factors responsible for these positive results </plain></SENT>
