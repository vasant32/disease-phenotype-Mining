<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 431 participants were surveyed individually at the Shinchon Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea, to determine their PA levels before diagnosis, during treatment and after completion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percentage of survivors meeting American College of Sports Medicine guideline significantly reduced from 27 % before diagnosis to 10 % during treatment due to reduced strenuous intensity PA (28.8 ± 106.2 vs 11.8 ± 95.9 min, p = 0.042), while total PA and mild intensity PA did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total (187.2 ± 257.7 vs. 282.6 ± 282.0 min, p &lt; 0.001) and mild (99.1 ± 191.5 vs. 175.1 ± 231.2 min, p &lt; 0.001) intensity PA significantly increased after the completion of treatments compared with their PA level before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further analyses showed that age (more vs. equal or less than 60 years) and chemotherapy (chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy) significantly influenced the level of physical activity (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survivors who were older or received chemotherapy increased their total PA and mild intensity PA after the completion of treatment more than those who did not receive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The level and the pattern of physical activity by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors differed across <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> trajectories, which were significantly influenced by age and adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
