<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 39 patients resistant to both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and irinotecan were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of irinotecan 180/m(2) every 14 days, weekly cetuximab standard dose and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Partial response was observed in 8 patients (20%), stable disease in 24 (61%) and progressive disease in 7 (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> was 6/22 (27%) and in mutated KRAS it was 2/15 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression was 8 months (6.4-9.4) and median overall survival 12 months (10.1-13.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, grade 3-4 adverse events were observed in 24 patients (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This regimen is active and moderately well tolerated in heavily pretreated advanced colorectal patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, caution is advisable when interpreting these results, because they run against the findings of two large phase III trials </plain></SENT>
