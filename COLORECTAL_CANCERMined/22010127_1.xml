<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the experiences of men after treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, identify barriers to accessing services, and suggest improvements to providing information in primary and secondary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Semistructured, qualitative interview study with purposive sampling and thematic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 28 patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: West Midlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most men treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> as a consequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, however, want the same response from health professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> is profoundly stressful for most men, affecting self image, behaviour, and relationships, some do not regard it as a health priority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many of the men were uninformed about <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> and were unprepared for it, and the majority neither helped themselves nor asked for help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Almost none were receiving adequate, effective, and affordable care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evidence of ageism was strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unlike patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are not routinely offered information and treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Greater coordination of care and consistent strategies are needed to tackle the unmet needs of this widely diverse patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Currently, clinicians are inadvertently neglecting, misleading, and offending such patients; better training could improve this situation, as might the reorganisation of services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to determine whether trained clinical nurse specialists in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> units could coordinate ongoing care </plain></SENT>
