<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies provided strong support for the view that ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) plays a central role in cell-cycle progression and also in pathological processes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that USP22 levels are elevated in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with associated increase in the expression of several cell-cycle-related genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the precise mechanism for these functions of USP22 at molecular level has not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently, we investigated the role of USP22 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that USP22 expression was statistically significantly correlated positively with that of BMI-1, c-Myc and both, pAkt (Ser473), and pAkt (Thr308), in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> tissues from 43 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of USP22 expression in HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells by siRNA resulted in the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RNAi-knockdown of USP22 in HCT16 cells also led to the repression of BMI-1 and was accompanied by the up-regulation of p16INK4a and p14ARF, with a consequent decrease in E2F1 and p53 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, down-regulation of c-Myc-targeted cyclin D2 was also noticed in cells treated with USP22-siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results showed that USP22 deletion also caused down-regulation of Akt/GSK3Î² activity, which can also contribute to the reduction of cyclin D2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our current results suggest that USP22 may act as an oncogene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as it positively regulates cell cycle via both BMI-1-mediated INK4a/ARF pathway and Akt signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
