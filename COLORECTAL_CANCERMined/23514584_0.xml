<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with chemotherapy refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and KRAS mutations have no effective treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the efficacy of temsirolimus in chemotherapy refractory mCRC with KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we wanted to investigate if resistance to temsirolimus could be reversed by the addition of irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we analyzed pre-treatment blood samples for KRAS mutations to investigate the association between quantitative measures of KRAS mutated alleles and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Material and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients received weekly temsirolimus 25 mg until progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter patients were treated with combination therapy comprising biweekly irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) and weekly temsirolimus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A polymerase chain reaction method was used to quantify the KRAS mutated alleles in plasma (pKRAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight percent achieved stable disease on monotherapy and 63% on combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four and eight patients had a minimal response, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 160 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression was 45 and 84 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The concordance between KRAS status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and plasma was 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reduction had low levels of pKRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patients with high pKRAS had a 77% risk of early progression on monotherapy compared to 43% in patients with lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Multivariate survival analysis confirmed that pKRAS was a strong prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Temsirolimus has limited efficacy in chemotherapy resistant KRAS mutant disease, but plasma KRAS quantification is a strong predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
