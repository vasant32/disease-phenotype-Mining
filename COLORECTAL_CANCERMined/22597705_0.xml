<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: SETTING: PARTICIPANTS: We developed a set of indicators to assess the implementation in daily practice of recommendation produced by a regional network (Istituto Toscano Tumori) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This set was tested in a retrospective study in the resident population of the Tuscany Region; the regional health system is organized on 12 local health authorities which refer to three macro areas (Area Vasta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included incident colorectal, lung and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cases listed in 2004 for the Tuscan <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, a population-based registry which collected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cases diagnosed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents in Tuscany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electronic data from registry database were used to determine the compliance with each indicator for patients in 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To validate the results, an ad hoc clinical survey including the same geographical area for the year 2006 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of patients who fulfilled each of the indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study showed the feasibility of the evaluation of the quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry population-based data and major computerized information systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The estimation of the selected indicators confirmed a good homogeneity among areas, and globally revealed a good intraregional performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Further work is needed to develop specific quality measures, particularly about structural data and to continually revise indicators of quality of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Data from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry, however, can be useful to evaluate quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
