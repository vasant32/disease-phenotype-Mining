<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The associations between dietary fat intakes and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have been examined in many epidemiological studies, but the results have remained inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to examine the associations of total fat and fatty acid intakes with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Guangzhou, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was carried out between July 2010 and May 2012 in Guangzhou, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and eighty-nine consecutively recruited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases were frequency matched to 976 controls by age (5-year interval) and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information by face-to-face interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total fat intake was not related to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with an OR (95% CI) of 0.95 (0.68-1.32) comparing the highest with the lowest quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intakes of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and n-6 polyunsaturated fat were also not associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a significant inverse association was found between total n-3 polyunsaturated fat, α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25048,27432">linolenic acid</z:chebi>, and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fat consumption and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The adjusted ORs of the highest versus the lowest quartile were 0.45 (95% CI=0.32-0.64, Ptrend&lt;0.01) for total n-3 polyunsaturated fat, 0.54 (95% CI=0.38-0.76, Ptrend&lt;0.01) for α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25048,27432">linolenic acid</z:chebi>, and 0.58 (95% CI=0.41-0.82, Ptrend&lt;0.01) for long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggested that total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and n-6 polyunsaturated fat intakes were not related to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, increased consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fat might reduce the risk </plain></SENT>
