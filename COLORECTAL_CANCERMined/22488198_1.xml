<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the specific direct role of ERβ in CAC has not yet been tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effects of ERβ deficiency in the azoxymethane (AOM)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS)-induced CAC model using ER�� knockout (βERKO) mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mice were injected with AOM followed by 1 week of DSS treatment, and sacrificed on weeks 9 or 16. βERKO mice developed more severe clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> compared to WT mice, as evidenced by significantly higher disease activity index after DSS treatment, weight to length ratio of the colons, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> score and grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ERβ-deficient colons presented greater number and size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> at weeks 9 and 16, respectively, and were characterized by a significant increase in interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha and interferon-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, higher protein expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa B, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, β-catenin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, mucin-1 and significantly lower caveolin-1 and mucin-2 protein levels were shown in βERKO mice compared to WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a possible anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic mechanism of action of ERβ in CAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate for the first time that ERβ provides protection in the AOM/DSS-induced CAC model in mice, suggesting a preventive and/or therapeutic potential for the use of ERβ-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in IBD </plain></SENT>
