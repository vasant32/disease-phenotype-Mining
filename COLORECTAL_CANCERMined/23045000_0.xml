<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence increases with advancing age, doubling every 7 years in patients aged â‰¥50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The medical and societal burdens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> will probably worsen over the coming decades as the number of older individuals (&gt;70) continues to grow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No evidence-based guidelines are available for this age group, as older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are generally excluded from randomized clinical trials and the fit ones who are recruited are not representative of the general elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When feasible, surgery is the most successful treatment option for eradicating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e>, as well as any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operative risk under elective conditions is not markedly different in older than in younger patients; however, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting is to be avoided as it is associated with high operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Well-selected older patients can tolerate chemotherapy, but benefits need to be balanced against potentially limited life expectancy and reduced quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of combination chemotherapy is an area of much controversy, but this treatment should not necessarily be withheld because of the age of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Careful monitoring of toxicities and early intervention is essential in older patients undergoing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
