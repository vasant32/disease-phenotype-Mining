<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been limited data regarding screening colonoscopy in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were therefore to determine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates in Thai people, to evaluate the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detected during screening colonoscopy and to determine the endoscopic findings of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> which might have some impact on endoscopists to perform polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective electronic chart review of asymptomatic Thai adults who underwent screening colonoscopy in our endoscopic center from June 2007 to October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,594 cases were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients had an average age of 58.3 ± 10.5 years (range 27-82) and 55.5% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases (83.8%) were handled by staff who were endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 488 patients (30.6%) were reported to have <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left-sided colon was the most common site (45.1%), followed by right-sided colon (36.5%) and the rectum (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were removed in 97.5% of cases and 88.5 % of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were sent for histopathology (data lost 11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and sixty three cases had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath>, accounting for 16.5 % ADR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in 43 cases (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>Hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> were mainly located distal to the splenic flexure of the colon whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were found throughout the large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ten cases (0.6%) were found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Four advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and two malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were reported in lesions ≤ 5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate, advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detection rate in the screening colonoscopy of Thai adults were 30.9%, 16.5%, 2.6% and 0.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignant transformation</z:e> was detected regardless of the size and location of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore, new technology would play an important role indistinguishing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
