<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various commercial assays to analyze KRAS mutational status are currently certified for in vitro diagnostic use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the differences in the operational characteristics of the different assays have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since different assays could be different in specificity, sensitivity and precision, studies to clarify the best option for an adequate determination of KRAS mutation status are necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Until a gold standard for testing KRAS mutation status is established, the treating physician must interpret the results of any given assay keeping this limitation in mind </plain></SENT>
