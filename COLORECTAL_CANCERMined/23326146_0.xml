<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To quantitatively assess the relationship between energy intake and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancers</z:e> in a meta-analysis of cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the bibliographies of retrieved articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were included if they reported relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% CIs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancers</z:e> with respect to total energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When RRs were not available in the published article, they were computed from the exposure distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted independently by two investigators and discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third investigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed fixed-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions to compute the summary RR for highest versus lowest category of energy intake and for per unit energy intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancer</z:e> incidence by giving each study-specific RR a weight that was proportional to its precision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen studies consisting of 13 independent cohorts met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The studies included 995,577 participants and 5620 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancer</z:e> with an average follow-up of 11.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant inverse association was observed between energy intake and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancers</z:e> for the highest compared to the lowest caloric intake category was 0.90 (95% CI 0.81-0.98, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RR for an increment of 239 kcal/d energy intake was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99, P &lt; 0.05) in the fixed model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses, we noted that energy intake was associated with a reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-0.99, P &lt; 0.05) and an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.31, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There appeared to be no association with esophageal (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86-1.07, P &gt; 0.05) or pancreatic (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49-1.09, P &gt; 0.05) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Associations were also similar in studies from North America and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The RR was 1.02 (95% CI 0.79-1.25, P &gt; 0.05) when considering the six studies conducted in North America and 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.98, P &lt; 0.05) for the five studies from Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that high energy intake may reduce the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancer</z:e> incidence and has a preventive effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
