<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the outcome of laparoscopic resection for clinical T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with that of an open approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-three consecutive patients undergoing surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with suspected involvement of another organ (T4) by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection were matched with 19 patients who underwent an open approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> available clinicopathologic variables possibly associated with the outcome were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients (8.3%) who underwent the laparoscopic procedure were converted to the open technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the open group displayed more advanced pathologic T category (P = .008) and underwent more combined operation than patients in the laparoscopic group (P = .017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The R0 resection rate was 75% in the laparoscopic group and 52.6% in the open group (P = .135) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the laparoscopic group displayed a tendency for lower estimated blood loss (P = .083), sooner bowel movement (P=.075), and shorter length of hospital stay (P = .089) than patients in the open group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in postoperative complications were observed between the laparoscopic and open groups (20.8% versus 36.8%, P = .246) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 27 months, the 3-year disease-free survival rate in the laparoscopic group was found to be not significantly different from that in the open group (76.7% versus 58.8%; P=.303) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colorectal resection for T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is feasible and has perioperative and short-term oncologic outcomes similar to those of an open approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, further studies with long-term follow-up are needed to resolve these issues </plain></SENT>
