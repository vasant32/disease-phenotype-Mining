<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The objective of the current prospective, multicenter, international study was to trace the incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (OXLIPN) and to determine its clinical pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors also specifically tested whether patients who had more symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> OXLIPN eventually would develop a more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, cumulative form of OXLIPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventy patients (mean ± standard deviation age, 63.7 ± 8.7 years) who were scheduled to receive either combined leucovorin, 5-fluoruracil, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX) or combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were monitored prospectively at baseline and were followed in 4 European sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of hyperexcitability symptoms secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> OXLIPN was assessed by using a descriptive questionnaire (yes/no question) at each clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor and neurosensory criteria according to version 3 of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria were applied to clinically grade the severity of OXLIPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> OXLIPN was present in 146 of 170 patients (85.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of these patients manifested cold-induced perioral (95.2%) or pharyngolaryngeal (91.8%) dysesthesias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> OXLIPN that required prolongation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> infusion from 2 hours to 4 to 6 hours occurred in 32 of 146 patients (21.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> OXLIPN symptoms was correlated significantly (Spearman rho correlation coefficient [r]) with both the development (r = 0.602; P &lt; .001) and the degree of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, cumulative form (r = 0.702; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the vast majority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy will manifest symptoms of a transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> syndrome soon after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who have a more complex combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phenomena related to axonal hyperexcitability are those who eventually develop more severe OXLIPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may be advisable to test agents against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> OXLIPN to verify their effects on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> form </plain></SENT>
