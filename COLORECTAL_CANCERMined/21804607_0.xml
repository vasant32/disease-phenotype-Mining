<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>Melanoma</z:hpo> 2 (AIM2) is a member of the HIN-200 family of hematopoietic, IFN-inducible, nuclear proteins, associated with both, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> defense and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, AIM2 was found to act as a DNA sensor in innate immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we and others have previously demonstrated a high frequency of AIM2-alterations in microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate AIM2 function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, we here addressed AIM2-responsive target genes by microarray based gene expression profiling of 22 244 human genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 111 transcripts were significantly upregulated, whereas 80 transcripts turned out to be significantly downregulated in HCT116 cells, constitutively expressing AIM2, compared with AIM2-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the upregulated genes that were validated by quantitative PCR and western blotting we recognized several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs: IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI6, IRF7, ISG15, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, TLR3 and CIITA), as well as genes involved in intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and matrix remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of ISGs correlated with expression of AIM2 in 10 different IFN-γ treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-mediated knock-down of AIM2 resulted in reduced expression of HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB and CIITA in IFN-γ-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IFN-γ independent induction of HLA-DR genes and their encoded proteins was also demonstrated upon <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50845">doxycyclin</z:chebi>-regulated transient induction of AIM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Luciferase reporter assays revealed induction of the HLA-DR promoter upon AIM2 transfection in different cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>STAT-signaling was not involved in IFN-γ independent induction of ISGs, arguing against participation of cytokines released in an autostimulating manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that AIM2 mediates both IFN-γ dependent and independent induction of several ISGs, including genes encoding the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens HLA-DR-α and -β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests a novel role of the IFN/AIM2/ISG cascade likewise in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
