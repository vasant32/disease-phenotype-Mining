<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case-matched study aimed to compare long-term outcomes after surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using different approaches (VATS vs. thoracotomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1997 and 2008, 143 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who had received their first pulmonary metastasectomy were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three patients underwent a surgical procedure that utilized a thoracotomy approach (Group 1), and 90 patients underwent a surgical procedure that used a VATS-based approach (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After being matched for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> number, diameter (measured by computed tomography), and surgical procedure (wedge resection or lobectomy), 35 pairs of patients were finally enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study endpoints included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no hospital mortality in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the mean follow-up period of 50 months, 47.1% patients developed a recurrence (52% at the pulmonary level and 48% at systemic level), and 52.9% of the patients were alive at the time of analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between Groups 1 and 2 in terms of overall recurrences (54 vs. 40%, p = 0.23), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pulmonary recurrences (25.7 vs. 22.9%, p = 0.78), and same side lung recurrences (14.3 vs. 20%, p = 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival (OS) after lung resection was 43 and 51% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our case-matched study showed that survival outcome of pulmonary metastasectomy using VATS is not inferior to that of open thoracotomy in selected cases </plain></SENT>
