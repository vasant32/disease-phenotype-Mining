<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of charts from patients having undergone a second liver resection due to CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A control group was identified by selecting the first liver resection due to CLM occurring after a second resection due to CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients were hereby included in both the primary resection group (PRG) and the second resection group (SRG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The groups were compared statistically with regard to demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> and hepatic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences between the groups were noted in terms of perioperative events, although there was a trend towards PRG resections involving more liver segments than SRG resections (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of postoperative surgical complications was 17.4% in the PRG and 4% in the SRG (p = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The admission time was 10.6 days in the PRG and 8.4 days in the SRG (p = 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>30-day mortality was 4% in the PRG and 0% in the SRG (p = 0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The five-year survival was 36% in the PRG and 42% in the SRG (p = 0.17) CONCLUSION: This study shows that a second hepatic resection due to recurrent CLM is safe and feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It also shows that patients undergoing a second liver resection due to CLM have five-year survival rates comparable to those of patients who have only undergone one hepatic resection due to CLM </plain></SENT>
