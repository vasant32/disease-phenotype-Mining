<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate both short- and long-term outcomes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study is a retrospective cohort study of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: This study as conducted at an academic tertiary hospital in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We investigated 1127 consecutive patients with stages 0 to III primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent curative resection in our department from January 2001 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on estimated glomerular filtration rate, patients were classified into stages 0 to 2 (including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function, 882 patients, 78.2%), stages 3 to 4 (226 patients, 20.1%), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>stage 5 chronic kidney disease</z:hpo> (19 patients, 1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinicopathological data, perioperative course, frequencies of postoperative complications, adjuvant chemotherapy, and recurrence-free and overall survivals after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were compared among the 3 different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> stage groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> stage 5 frequently experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and cardiovascular comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were also hypoalbuminemic and anemic and more likely to receive blood transfusions, although estimated blood loss was smaller during surgery than in the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perioperative cardiovascular complications were more frequent in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> stages 3 to 4 and 5 groups (5.3%) than those in the stages 0 to 2 group (0.8%, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the frequencies of other complications were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the frequency of adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence-free survival among different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> stages; in contrast, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> stage 5 group showed a poorer overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: : The study is limited by its retrospective nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From these data, we conclude that surgical resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> can be performed with acceptable outcomes </plain></SENT>
