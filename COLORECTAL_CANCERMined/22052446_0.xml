<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is based on this group's younger age for the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine the yield of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in average-risk black Americans including those &lt;age 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also aimed to identify whether there was a higher prevalence of proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in black Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY: This was a cross-sectional, retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> colonoscopy examinations from 2007 through 2010 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete examinations with a good/excellent preparation in average-risk black patients 45-49 were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with signs, symptoms, or family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Defined two control groups: average-risk black and white patients ages 50-59 who completed a colonoscopy during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient's height, weight, and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> medications and aspirin were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients currently using tobacco at least weekly were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1,230 patients with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> for a prevalence of 40.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We included 304 black Americans 45-49 years, 669 black Americans 50-59 years, and 257 whites 50-59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no association between race/age group and the presence of at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In regression modeling, both male sex and active smoking were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Male sex and active smoking are risk factors for prevalent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> is similar in black Americans 45-49 compared to older black and white patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We did not find that the recognized proximal distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in black Americans parallels a similar distribution in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in this group </plain></SENT>
