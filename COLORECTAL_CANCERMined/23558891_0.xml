<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and activity of bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI in this setting.Methods:Patients aged 18-75 years, PS 0-1, with resectable liver-confined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They received bevacizumab 5 mg kg(-1) followed by irinotecan 180 mg m(-)(2), leucovorin 200 mg m(-)(2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> 400 mg m(-)(2) bolus and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> 2400 mg m(-)(2) 46-h infusion, biweekly, for 7 cycles </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single-stage, single-arm phase 2 study design was applied with 1-year progression-free rate as the primary end point, and 39 patients required.Results:From October 2007 to December 2009, 39 patients were enrolled in a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Objective response rate was 66.7% (95% exact CI: 49.8-80.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 37 patients (94.9%) underwent surgery, with a R0 rate of 84.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a pathological complete remission (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of 37 patients, 16 (43.2%) had at least one surgical complication (most frequently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biloma</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1 year of follow-up, 24 patients were alive and free from disease progression (61.6%, 95% CI: 44.6-76.6) </plain></SENT>
