<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stage and age at diagnosis are important prognostic factors for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion cured by stage and age is unknown in England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This population-based study includes 29,563 adult patients who were diagnosed and registered with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during 1997-2004 and followed till 2007 in North West England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple imputation was used to provide more reliable estimates of stage at diagnosis, when these data were missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cure mixture models were used to estimate the proportion 'cured' and the median survival of the uncured by age and stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For both colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> the proportion of patients cured and median survival time of the uncured decreased with advancing stage and increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients aged under 65 years had the highest proportion cured and longest median survival of the uncured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients is dependent on stage and age at diagnosis with younger patients or those with less advanced disease having a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further efforts are required, in order to reduce the proportion of patients presenting with stage III and IV disease and ultimately increase the chance of cure </plain></SENT>
