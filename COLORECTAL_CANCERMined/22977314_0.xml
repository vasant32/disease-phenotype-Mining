<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients' experience of colonic endoscopic procedures is scarcely reported, even though it is considered a major factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pain due to air inflation or stretching the colon with an endoscope is not rare during examination and may be the main obstacle to cooperation and participation in a screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose a four-stage study for developing a tool dedicated to pain monitoring during colonoscopy, as follows: (1) comparison of patient, nurse, and endoscopist questionnaire responses about patient pain and technical details of the procedure using the PAINAD tool during colonoscopy; (2) observation of the correlation between patients' facial expressions and other parameters (using the short PAINAD); (3) development of a device for continuous monitoring of the patient's facial expression during the procedure; (4) assessment of the usability of such a tool and its contribution to the outcomes of colonoscopy procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early intervention by the staff performing the procedure, in reaction to alerts encoded by this tool, may prevent adverse events during the procedure </plain></SENT>
