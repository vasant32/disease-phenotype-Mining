<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This unselected prospective case series reports on the proportion of patients having a completed laparoscopic colorectal resection in two units where laparoscopic colorectal practice is well established and readily available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients undergoing elective and emergency colorectal resection during a 6-month period were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathology and the surgical approach (laparoscopic or open) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contraindications to laparoscopic resection were also documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The need and rationale for conversion to an open approach were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 205 consecutive patients (160 elective and 45 emergency procedures) underwent colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> [117 (57%) patients] and benign pathology [88 (43%) patients] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic resection was attempted in 127/205 (62%) patients and 31/127 (24%) of these were converted to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main reasons for not attempting laparoscopic resection were locally advanced disease and emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The commonest reasons for conversion were advanced disease and to allow completion of rectal dissection and/or cross-stapling of the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite a special interest in laparoscopic colorectal surgery of the two colorectal units who provided the data for this study, fewer than half (96/205; 47%) of the patients in this consecutive unselected series who were undergoing major colorectal resection had the procedure completed laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
