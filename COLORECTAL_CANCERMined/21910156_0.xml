<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SMAD7 regulates <z:hpo ids='HP_0004386'>gastrointestinal inflammation</z:hpo> by inhibiting transforming growth factor-Î² (TGFB), which can act as both a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor and a promoter of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regular use of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitors, such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>), reduces the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because COX2 overexpression reduces the growth suppressing effects of TGFB, we hypothesized that survival may depend on both SMAD7 genotype and prediagnostic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postmenopausal women, ages 50-74, diagnosed with incident invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 1997 to 2002 were identified using the Seattle-Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information on prediagnostic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and other risk factors was ascertained by interview, and women were followed-up for survival through December 31, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven hundred and twenty-seven cases were genotyped for two GWAS hits in SMAD7 with minor allele frequency &gt; 30%, one with minor allele associated with decreased risk (rs4939827) and one with minor allele associated with increased risk (rs4464148) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and forty-two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred, 160 attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those without distant disease at diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific survival differed by genotype only for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> users: each minor allele of rs4939827 was associated with worse survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-5.37] and each minor allele of rs4464148 was associated with better survival (HR = 0.41, CI 0.18-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SMAD7 variants known to be important for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were associated with disease-specific survival among prediagnostic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
