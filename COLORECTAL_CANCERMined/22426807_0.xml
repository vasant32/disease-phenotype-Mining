<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, interferon (IFN)-γ production was significantly increased in naïve splenocytes after they were coincubated with MC38-IL4 and CpG-ODN </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific cytolysis was detected when splenocytes of MC38-IL4 + CpG-ODN-treated mice were stimulated by γ-irradiated MC38-IL4 cells and CpG-ODN twice weekly in vitro and used as effector cells in a <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi>-release assay (32.2 ± 3.5% for MC38 cells vs. 3.2 ± 1.1% for YAC-1 cells; at an effector to target ratio of 40) </plain></SENT>
