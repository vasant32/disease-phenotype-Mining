<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>144 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection specimens were staged prospectively using both TNM 5 and TNM 7 criteria during routine reporting by specialist gastrointestinal pathologists within a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pN stage remained the same under both systems apart from the required subclassification of pN1 and pN2 under TNM 7 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in frequency of pN stage migration between this study and our audit suggests that the application of TNM 7 to the assessment of discontinuous/satellite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> foci is subject to significant inter-observer variability </plain></SENT>
