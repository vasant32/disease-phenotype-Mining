<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to examine the consequences of a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell lines deficient and proficient in the DNA mismatch repair system (MMR) to advance our understanding on the relationship between MMR and heat shock proteins (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines HCT116 (parent cells), HCT116 + ch2 (MMR-deficient), and HCT116 + ch3 (MMR-proficient) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were incubated at 41°C and 42°C for 1 h and then at 37°C for 4 and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of Hsp27 and Hsp72 was evaluated by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hsp27, Hsp72, hMLH1 and hMSH2 levels were assessed by western blotting in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The alkaline comet assay was used to evaluate the DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> significantly increased the protein expression levels of Hsp27 and Hsp72 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines, which was higher in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HCT116 + ch3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also observed that heat induced translocation of hMLH1 and hMSH2 proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in HCT116 + ch3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The comet assay revealed that HCT116 parent cells were more resistant to heat-induced DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the MMR-proficient and deficient cell lines repaired the DNA damage at the same rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> induced the nuclear accumulation of Hsp27 and Hsp72 and affected the subcellular localisation of hMLH1 and hMSH2 in HCT116 + ch3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the MMR system is not a direct determining factor for the different heat shock response in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
