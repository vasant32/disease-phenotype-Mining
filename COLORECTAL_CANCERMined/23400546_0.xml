<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of these RTKs, c-ros oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1), has been identified as a driver mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>, because its inhibition by crizotinib, an anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK)/met proto-oncogene hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET)/ROS1 inhibitor, led to significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage in ROS1-rearranged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, only human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy in combination with chemotherapy has been successful in significantly prolonging the survival of patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (GC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is a need for the discovery of additional novel targets in GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anti-ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to screen 495 GC samples and was followed by simultaneous ROS1 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses in IHC-positive samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fusion partners in ROS1-rearranged GC were determined by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 495 samples, HER2 amplification was identified with FISH, and MET expression was identified by IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples were ROS1 IHC-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of 23 patients were ROS1 FISH positive, HER2 FISH negative, and negative for MET overexpression; and 2 of those 3 patients harbored a solute carrier family 34 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37583,37586">sodium phosphate</z:chebi>), member 2 (SLC34A2)-ROS1 fusion transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No fusion partner was identified in the third patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both patients who had SLC34A2-ROS1 transcripts had poorly differentiated histology with recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 2 years of curative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ROS1 IHC-positive status was not identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, an SLC34A2-ROS1 rearrangement was identified in GC, and the results provide a rationale for investigating the clinical efficacy of ROS1 inhibitors in this unique molecular subset of GC </plain></SENT>
