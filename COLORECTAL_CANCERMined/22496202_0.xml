<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Of the numerous complications associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> is a deleterious and persistent patient complaint commonly attributed to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the occurrence of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> before the initiation of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifty-two patients underwent extensive quantitative sensory testing (QST) before receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in multiple functions of primary afferent fibers were assessed and compared with a group of healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skin temperature, sensorimotor function, sharpness detection, and thermal detection were measured, as was touch detection, using both conventional (von Frey monofilaments) and novel (Bumps detection test) methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had subclinical deficits, especially in sensorimotor function, detection of thermal stimuli, and touch detection that were present before the initiation of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The measured impairment in touch sensation was especially pronounced when using the Bumps detection test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in this study exhibited deficits in sensory function before undergoing chemotherapy treatment, implicating the disease itself as a contributing factor in chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The widespread nature of the observed deficits further indicated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is affecting multiple primary afferent subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specific to the finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010830'>impaired touch sensation</z:hpo>, results from this study highlight the use of newly used methodology, the Bumps detection test, as a sensitive and useful tool in the early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
