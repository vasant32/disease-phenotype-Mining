<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total number of 100 samples were examined, 50 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples (cases) and 50 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (controls), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were stained with Alcian blue method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Acid mucin increased, in different levels, in 30 (60%) of the cases compared to only six (12%) of controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, complete absence of acid mucin was detected among 10 (20%) of cases compared to none among controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is associated with secretion of increased amounts of acid mucin in most cases, and that should be considered as a valuable histological finding </plain></SENT>
