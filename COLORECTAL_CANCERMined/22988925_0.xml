<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and the influence of early diagnosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage in a tertiary care hospital in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 364 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who had never participated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial symptoms, diagnosis and treatment delay were determined using a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing diagnostic status were analyzed using univariate analysis and logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 307 patients were enrolled, in which 128 were with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 179 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of diagnosis delay was significant longer than that of treatment delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was likely to be treated at an advanced stage with a short interval between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon cancer</z:hpo> patients with a history of biliary tract or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gallbladder stones</z:e>, aged ≥ 50 years and with abdominal mass or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> as the initial symptom were diagnosed and treated much earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, women and non-smokers were diagnosed and treated quickly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors correlated with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, including bloody stool as the initial symptom (OR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.08-6.25, P = 0.034) and a history of appendectomy (OR = 4.00, 95% CI 1.15-14.29, P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The factors contributing to early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection were identified but their clinical value is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis by symptoms suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> needs to be improved and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening should be vigorously promoted </plain></SENT>
