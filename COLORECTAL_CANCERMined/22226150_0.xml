<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study presents changes that take place in galanin (GAL)-containing components of the enteric <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main goal of our study was to investigate the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the GAL-ergic neurons and nerve fibers in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-affected part of the colon and to compare results to the unchanged part of the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on tissue samples collected from 15 patients (9 women and 6 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The material was collected during surgery, i.e., resection of the anterior sigmoid colon and anterior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> of the rectum, from patients in good general condition, without any other significant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and ELISA were used to study, respectively, the distribution of neurons and nerve fibers containing GAL and concentration of this neuropeptide in the human large intestine during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Morphological examinations have revealed that a statistically significantly higher percentage of GAL+ neurons (46%) was observed in the pathologically changed myenteric plexuses as compared to the unchanged part of the intestine (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in the density of GAL+ nerve fibers in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biochemical examinations performed with the ELISA revealed that the average GAL content in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues was 9.38 ng/g versus 12.27 ng/g in the morphologically unchanged tissues (the difference was statistically significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the continuous presence of GAL-ergic innervation in the immediate vicinity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> invasion, which may be attributed to increased contraction of the affected part of intestine </plain></SENT>
