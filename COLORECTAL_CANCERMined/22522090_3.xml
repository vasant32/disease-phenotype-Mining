<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in a nationwide cohort of 47,374 Danish patients with IBD over a 30-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined relative risk (RR) values using Poisson regression-derived incidence rate ratios of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 1 year after IBD diagnosis, adjusted for age, sex, and calendar time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among patients with IBD vs individuals without IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 178 million person-years of follow-up evaluation, 268 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 70 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among patients with UC was comparable with that of the general population (RR, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patients diagnosed with UC in childhood or as adolescents, those with long duration of disease, and those with concomitant primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> were at increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with UC, the overall RR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> decreased from 1.34 (95% CI, 1.13-1.58) in 1979-1988 to 0.57 (95% CI, 0.41-0.80) in 1999-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with CD, the overall RR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.67-1.07), which did not change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of UC or CD no longer seems to increase patients' risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, although subgroups of patients with UC remain at increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decreasing risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 1979 to 2008 might result from improved therapies for patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
