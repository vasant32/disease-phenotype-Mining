<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted among people (n = 1,193) invited to participate in at least two successive rounds of a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening program in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona, Spain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified according to their adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening guidelines (non-adherent, irregular adherent and totally adherent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Independent variables were sociodemographic variables, self-perceived health, attitudes and beliefs regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and preventive activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binary and politomous logistic regression models were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the individuals invited to participate in the screening program, 14.4% were adherent to screening recommendations and 18.4% were occasionally adherent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found in beliefs and attitudes regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and its early detection among adherent and non-adherent individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sharing the decision to participate in screening with a family member increased adherence by nine- and tweve-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A positive perception of the screening process was a facilitator to adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes and beliefs regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and its early detection, as well as familial support, are associated with initial participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening but do not affect the persistence of preventive behavior over time </plain></SENT>
