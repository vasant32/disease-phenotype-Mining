<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of KRAS and BRAF mutation analysis could be used in the selection of patients for anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens were obtained during routine surgery of patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were established by standard procedures and confirmed histopathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After DNA extraction, KRAS mutations were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and BRAF mutations were analyzed using real-time PCR by fluorescence melting curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that KRAS gene mutations were detected in 35.6% samples and the most frequent mutation was Gly12Val </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BRAF gene mutation Val600Glu was detected in 8.5% samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between the KRAS mutation and Dukes' stage (p=0.034), with the lowest frequency in Dukes'A, and between the KRAS mutation and histological grade (p=0.044), with no KRAS mutation found in poor differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first data about KRAS and BRAF mutational status in the sample of Croatian population with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> shows that the incidence of KRAS and BRAF mutations is within generally valid limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are to be continued in order to determine whether these mutations contribute to progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
