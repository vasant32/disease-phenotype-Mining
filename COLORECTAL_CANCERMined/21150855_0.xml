<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish and compare differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery patients receiving either total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and remifentanil or inhalational anesthesia (INHAL) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and fentanyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After randomization, we included fifty consecutive patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TIVA patients received total intravenous anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and remifentanil, while INHAL patients received inhalation anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> in O2/air and fentanyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of IL-8, IL-17, MPO, ICAM-1, V-CAM and L-selectin were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood loss, body temperature and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were measured in patients both before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both groups, levels of IL-8, MPO, ICAM-1 and L-selectin decreased 60 min after the start of surgery (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01, respectively) and 30 min post-surgery (P&lt;0.05 for both groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the INHAL group, V-CAM levels were significantly lower 60 min after the start of surgery (P&lt;0.01) and 30 min post-surgery (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 24 h post-surgery, V-CAM levels were significantly higher in both groups (P&lt;0.01), while IL-17 levels significantly increased only in the INHAL group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were also observed in the INHAL group compared to that in the TIVA group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TIVA with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and remifentanil and INHAL with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and fentanyl induced similar <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found that IL-17 cytokine levels were higher in patients anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and fentanyl </plain></SENT>
