<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Combination chemotherapy for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> often is superior in clinical efficacy to monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the schedule-dependent effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> derivatives (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines, and to explore factors affecting it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-derived cell lines, DLD-1 and HCT116, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three treatment schedules were tested, and growth inhibitory effects were evaluated with a WST-1 assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined effects were assessed with isobolograms and a combination index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cellular accumulation and DNA-binding of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> were measured with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure to 5-FU followed by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> produced synergistic effects in DLD-1 cells, and the amount of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> bound to DNA was substantially increased as compared with that for other schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5-FU and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> also tended to be synergistic when 5-FU was given first, but no significant change in the cellular kinetics of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in HCT116 cells, the combined effects of 5-FU and <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> derivatives were comparable among the three schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exposure to 5-FU followed by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> had a synergistic effect in DLD-1 cells, suggesting that the amount of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> bound to DNA contributes to this result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, the effect was dependent on the type of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> derivative and cell </plain></SENT>
