<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17823">Calcitriol</z:chebi> and its precursor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">calcidiol</z:chebi> (25(OH)D(3)) are degraded by the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This enzyme is overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, however, the mechanisms of this overexpression remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CYP24A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level differs among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines and range from almost undetectable to high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since DNA methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation regulate CYP24A1 gene expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, we investigated whether epigenetic mechanisms could explain the differences in basal expression of CYP24A1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methyltransferase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (DAC) treatment resulted in an over 50-fold induction of CYP24A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in Coga1A and HT-29 cells but in no response in Caco2/AQ and Coga13 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding is supported by a strong increase in CYP24A1 activity after DAC treatment in Coga1A (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17823">calcitriol</z:chebi> and DAC had synergistic effects on CYP24A1 gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the CYP24A1 promoter was not methylated in Coga1A and HT-29 (&lt;5%), while in Caco2/AQ it was 62% methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that DNA demethylation must activate genes upstream of CYP24A1 rather than act on the gene itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, transcriptional regulators of CYP24A1 such as <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> X receptor (RXR), specificity protein 1 (SP1), or mediator complex subunit 1 (MED1) were not upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, CYP24A1 gene expression is inducible by methyltransferase and some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors in a cell line-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This effect does not correlate with the methylation state of the promoter and therefore must affect genes upstream of CYP24A1 </plain></SENT>
