<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This work aimed to investigate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-associated humoral immune response to four pilus proteins of this bacterium by newly developed ELISAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pilus proteins are interesting diagnostic targets as they are the building blocks of pilin-like structures that mediate <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> virulence and are readily exposed to the host immune system upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of serum antibodies against these pilus proteins was evaluated in Dutch and American populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These analyses showed that an immune response to these antigens was specific for clinical S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, but that increased serum antibody titers to multiple pilus proteins in single individuals were rarely observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a multiplex approach based on antibody titers against any of these four antigens resulted in assay sensitivities between 16% and 43% for the detection of early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together these findings underscore the potential of a multi-antigen approach to complement diagnosis of S. gallolyticus subsp </plain></SENT>
