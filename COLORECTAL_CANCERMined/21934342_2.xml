<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Survivin and livin are novel members of the inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein family, which have rarely been studied in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to examine their expression and association with clinicopathological factors and prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and evaluate the possibility of their use as biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the expression of survivin and livin in 61 CRC samples using immunohistochemical staining (Envision) and correlated it with the survival of these patients using log-rank test and correlation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 61 cases, 60.7 and 54.1% were positive for expression of survivin (p &lt; 0.05) and livin (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No expression of survivin and livin was detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation (r = -0.9916) between the increased survivin and livin levels and overall survival was observed in univariate survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of both proteins was not correlated with age, gender, degrees of differentiation, and TNM stage (p &lt; 0.05) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High expression of both survivin and livin may influence the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding opens new perspectives for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis because survivin and livin can both be used as biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
