<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>miRNAs are a class of endogenous non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, which can regulate downstream target genes through binding to the 3'UTR of those genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have indicated that abnormal expression of miRNAs is implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant expression of miR-31 has been found in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that miR-31 is upregulated in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissues and cell lines, and that repression of miR-31 inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell proliferation and colony formation in soft <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate the mechanism underlying the role of miR-31 in promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, we used online miRNA target prediction databases and found that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor RhoTBT1 may be a target of miR-31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imunohistochemistry assay revealed that RhoBTB1 was significantly decreased in HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, ectopic expression of miR-31 reduced RhoBTB1 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line HT29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that suppression of RhoBTB1 may be responsible for colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, which was inhibited directly by miR-31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and soft <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> colony-formation assays showed that knockdown of RhoBTB1 by RNAi induced cell proliferation, and colony formation in soft <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi>, which mimicked the function of miR-31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This further suggested that suppression of RhoBTB1 was responsible for colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found that miR-31 acts as an oncogene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and identified RhoBTB1 as a new target of miR-31 further study demonstrated that miR-31 contributed to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> at least partly by targeting RhoBTB1 </plain></SENT>
