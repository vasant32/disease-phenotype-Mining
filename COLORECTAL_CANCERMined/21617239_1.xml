<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, clinical data for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and irinotecan (XELIRI) with bevacizumab are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 139 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> to assess the efficacy and safety of first-line bevacizumab in combination with XELIRI or FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate and radical resection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences in efficacy were observed between patients administered XELIRI or FOLFIRI with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ORR, median OS and PFS and recorded adverse events (AEs) were comparable to those previously reported, with no new or unexpected AEs observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab is similarly efficacious and well tolerated when administered with XELIRI or FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
