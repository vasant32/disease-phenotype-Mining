<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, previous studies have provided evidence of improved outcomes from access to timely and appropriate health services along the disease trajectory in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, the CIHR/CCNS Team in Access to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Services in Nova Scotia (Team ACCESS) was created to build <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) research capacity in Nova Scotia (NS) and to study access to and quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> services along the entire continuum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this paper are to: 1) provide a detailed description of the methodologies employed across the various studies being conducted by Team ACCESS; 2) demonstrate how administrative health data can be used to evaluate access and quality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> services; and 3) provide an example of an interdisciplinary team approach to addressing health service delivery issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in NS between 2001 and 2005 were identified through the Nova Scotia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (NSCR) and staged using the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using administrative databases that were linked at the patient level, Team ACCESS created a retrospective longitudinal cohort with comprehensive demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data were used to examine access to and quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> services in NS, as well as factors affecting access to and quality of care, at various transition points along the continuum of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Team ACCESS has also implemented integrated knowledge translation strategies targeting policy- and decision- makers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The development of Team ACCESS represents a unique approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that the skills, tools, and knowledge generated from our work will also advance the study of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> disease sites in NS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the increasing prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and with national and provincial funding agencies promoting collaborative research through increased funding for research team development, the work carried out by Team ACCESS is important in the Canadian context and exemplifies how a team approach is essential to comprehensively addressing issues surrounding not only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, but other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases in Canada </plain></SENT>
