<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Single-center prospective cohort study before and after reinforcement of an ERAS protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made both between and across periods using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical data (114 variables) were prospectively recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Ersta Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Nine hundred fifty-three consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>: 464 patients treated in 2002 to 2004 and 489 in 2005 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The association between improved adherence to the ERAS protocol and the incidence of postoperative symptoms, complications, and length of stay following major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following an overall increase in preoperative and perioperative adherence to the ERAS protocol from 43.3% in 2002 to 2004 to 70.6% in 2005 to 2007, both postoperative complications (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.98) and symptoms (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.70) declined significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restriction of intravenous fluid and use of a preoperative carbohydrate drink were major independent predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Across periods, the proportion of adverse postoperative outcomes (30-day morbidity, symptoms, and readmissions) was significantly reduced with increasing adherence to the ERAS protocol (&gt;70%, &gt;80%, and &gt;90%) compared with low ERAS adherence (&lt;50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Improved adherence to the standardized multimodal ERAS protocol is significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes following major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery, indicating a dose-response relationship </plain></SENT>
