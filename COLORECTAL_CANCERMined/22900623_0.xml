<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors reported findings from a pilot feasibility study of a novel telephone-based intimacy enhancement protocol that addresses the intimacy and sexual concerns of couples facing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of a flexible coping model, the intervention was designed to help couples make cognitive and behavioral shifts in their intimate relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were 18 individuals (9 dyads) who completed the intervention and measures of feasibility (frequency, ease of use, helpfulness of skills, ratings of rapport), program evaluations, and measures of sexual and relationship functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most participants reported that the intervention was "quite a bit" or "extremely" helpful and that they had used the skills taught within the past week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The skills most commonly practiced and perceived as most helpful tended to be behavioral (e.g., trying a new sexual activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors found the largest effect sizes (â‰¥.60) for sexual distress, sexual function (female), and sexual communication </plain></SENT>
