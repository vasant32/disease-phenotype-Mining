<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The trial was designed to test whether calcium plus <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation in a population in which the use of these supplements was widespread would reduce hip fracture, and secondarily, total fracture and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: This study further examines the health benefits and risks of calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation using WHI data, with emphasis on fractures, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: WHI calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> randomized clinical trial (CT) data through the end of the intervention period were further analyzed with emphasis on treatment effects in relation to duration of supplementation, and these data were contrasted and combined with corresponding data from the WHI prospective observational study (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among women not taking personal calcium or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplements at baseline, the hazard ratio [HR] for hip fracture occurrence in the CT following 5 or more years of calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation versus placebo was 0.62 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.38-1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In combined analyses of CT and OS data, the corresponding HR was 0.65 (95 % CI, 0.44-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Supplementation effects were not apparent on the risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, or total mortality, while evidence for a reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk and total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> risk among calcium plus <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> users was only suggestive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Though based primarily on a subset analysis, long-term use of calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> appears to confer a reduction that may be substantial in the risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other health benefits and risks of supplementation at doses considered, including an elevation in urinary tract stone formation, appear to be modest and approximately balanced </plain></SENT>
