<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the population coverage and diagnostic yield of offering an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (FIT) to non-responders to a flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) invitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cohort study conducted in a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this programme, eligible men and women aged 58 (Turin; 43 748 subjects) or 60 (Verona; 19 970 subjects) are invited, with a personal letter signed by their general practitioner, to undergo an FS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bowel preparation is limited to a single enema self-administered at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects in whom one distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> &gt;5 mm (≥10 mm in Turin) or at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (one advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or more than two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in Turin) is detected at FS are referred for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>People who do not respond to the invitation to undergo an FS are invited to have an FIT (OC-Sensor; Eiken, Tokyo, Japan; single sample, cut-off 100 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Attendance rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> yield were analysed in four consecutive birth cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall participation rate for the FS invitation was 39.3% in Verona and 29.9% in Turin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the eligible non-responders to the FS invitation, 19.3% (95% CI 18.9% to 19.7%) underwent an FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result, the proportion of people undergoing screening by FS or FIT was 55.2% in Verona and 39.3% in Turin, with no gender differences in either centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FIT detected 8.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 20.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> diagnosed at screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A strategy involving the sequential offer of FS and FIT is a feasible and efficient approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FIT in people not attending for FS increases screening uptake and detection of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
