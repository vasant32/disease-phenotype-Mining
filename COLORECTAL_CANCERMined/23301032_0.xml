<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we aimed to develop specific blood-based miRNA assay for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: TaqMan-based miRNA profiling was performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, adjacent non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, corresponding plasma from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, and plasma from matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> putative markers identified were verified in a training set of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selected markers were validated in a case-control cohort of 170 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, 100 controls, and 95 other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and then blindly validated in an independent set of 70 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients and 50 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Profiling results showed 8 miRNAs were concordantly up-regulated and 1 miRNA was concordantly down-regulated in both plasma and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 up-regulated miRNAs, only 3 were significantly elevated (p&lt;0.0001) before surgery and reduced after surgery in the training set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results from the validation cohort showed that a combination of miR-145 and miR-451 was the best biomarker (p&lt;0.0001) in discriminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> from healthy controls and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the blind validation, these plasma markers yielded Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve area of 0.931 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was 88% and the negative predictive value was 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altered levels of these miRNAs in plasma have been detected not only in advanced stages but also early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value for <z:mp ids='MP_0009508'>ductal carcinoma in situ</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCIS</z:e>) cases was 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that these circulating miRNAs could be a potential specific biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
