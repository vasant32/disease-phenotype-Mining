<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of oncolytic adenoviruses on the cell cycle remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity assays were performed to determine cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) alone or in combination with the oncolytic adenovirus KH901 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dynamic changes in the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins including p-AKT, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase 3 were investigated after treatment with 5-FU with or without KH901 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of S-phase cells were observed after treatment with KH901 and 5-FU than with 5-FU alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p-AKT, Bcl-2, and Bax expression was increased upon treatment with KH901, whereas the expression of caspase-3 was not induced upon treatment with KH901 with or without 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KH901 exhibited significant potential as an oncolytic adenovirus and increased cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in combination with 5-FU in LoVo cells, as compared to 5-FU alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, KH901 stimulates LoVo cells to enter the S-phase by activation of p-AKT, which could partly explain its synergistic effect with 5-FU on LoVo cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
