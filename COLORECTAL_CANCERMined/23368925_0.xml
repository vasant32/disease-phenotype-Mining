<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although OL has shown powerful anticancer activity the underlying action mechanism remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the effects of OL on hydroxityrosol (HT)-29 human <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells in comparison to hydroxytyrosol, its hydrolysis product, and to elucidate the underlying anticancer molecular mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was determined using SRB assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were assessed by flow cytometry and changes in MAPK cascade protein expression, HIF-1α, p53, PPARγ, and NFKβ signaling pathways by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although OL showed less potency than HT, in terms of cell growth inhibition, induced significant changes in cell cycle analysis and caused a significant increase in the apoptotic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both compounds produced a remarkable decrease in HIF-1α protein and an upregulation of p53 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant changes in IkB-α and MAPK cascade protein expressions were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HT produced a significant upregulation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) expression whereas OL failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PPARγ upregulation may be one of the principal mechanisms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage by HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our novel findings demonstrate that OL limits the growth and induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HT-29 cells via p53 pathway activation adapting the HIF-1α response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
