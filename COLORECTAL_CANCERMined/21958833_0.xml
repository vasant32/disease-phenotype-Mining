<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The targeted <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> was solitary in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patient 1, cryoablation was performed with a single cryoprobe, which was removed without freezing the cryoprobe tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patient 2, cryoablation was performed with two cryoprobes, both of which were removed after freezing of the cryoprobe tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The seeding nodule appeared 5 and 7 months after cryoablation on the follow-up computed tomographic scan, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the seeding nodules were solitary and existed primarily in the subcutaneous to chest muscle layer, and could be completely resected under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
