<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is believed that up to 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> and many post-colonoscopy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> arise from serrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-colonoscopy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> have been found to have a molecular signature similar to SSAs, including CpG island methylation, BRAF mutations, and microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel pit pattern, Type II-O, has been demonstrated to have a high specificity for SSAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the sensitivity is too low to utilize a Type II-O pit pattern to determine which serrated lesion is neoplastic and needs resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is significant endoscopist-related variability in the detection of serrated lesions of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Efforts to improve the detection of serrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are warranted </plain></SENT>
