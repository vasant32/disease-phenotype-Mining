<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the combined role of clinical, pathological and molecular parameters to identify those stage II patients who better benefit from adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 120 stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 60 patients received adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy after surgery and the other 60 did not receive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses were performed to evaluate the expressions of Thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), TP53 (p53), β-catenin (CTNNB1) and CD8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For TYMS, its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels were also investigated by real time qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The entire case study was characterized by the presence of a defect in the MMR (mismatch repair) system, the presence of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP or CIMP-High) and for the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the histo-pathological level, the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion, lymphovascular invasion, invasion of large veins, host lymphocytic response and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> border configuration were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene was a poor prognostic factor for disease free and overall survival (DFS; hazard ratio [HR], 2.57; 95% CI: 1.03 -6.37; p = 0.04 and OS; HR, 3.68; 95% CI: 1.43-9.47; p &lt; 0.01 respectively), independently of 5-FU treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant therapy significantly improved survival in patients with high TYMS levels (p = 0.04), while patients with low TYMS had a better outcome if treated by surgery alone (DFS; HR, 6.07; 95% CI, 0.82 to 44.89; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with a defect in the MMR system (dMMR), 5-FU therapy was associated to reduced survival (DFS; HR, 37.98; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1381.31; p = 0.04), while it was beneficial for CIMP-High associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (DFS; HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.13; p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients' characterization according to MMR status, CIMP phenotype and TYMS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression may provide a more tailored approach for adjuvant therapy in stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
