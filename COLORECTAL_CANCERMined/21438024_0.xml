<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in DNA methylation contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify gene promoters aberrantly methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> tissue in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed on two pooled DNA samples: from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and cancerous tissue obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was fractionated according to methylation degree with the use of affinity column containing <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-CpG binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To identify novel hypermethylated gene promoters, methylated DNA from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and from cancerous tissues were analyzed with the use of promoter microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified nine novel genes hypermethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of their promoter methylation was assessed in the larger group of patients (n = 77): KCNK12 (methylated in 41% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients), GPR101 (40%), CDH2 (45%), BARX1 (56%), CNTFR (22%), SYT6 (64%), SMO (21%), EPHA5 (43%), and GSPT2 (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of gene expression level analysis suggest the role of promoter methylation in downregulation of six out of nine genes examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not find correlation between gene methylation and age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade or stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> methylation of GPR101 correlated with longer time to progression (P = 0.0042; HR = 2.5468; 95% CI 1.5391-10.0708) </plain></SENT>
