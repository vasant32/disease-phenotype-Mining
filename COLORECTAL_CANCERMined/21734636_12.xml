<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality are among the Healthy People 2020 objectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening data are reported using information from 2002-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Annual percentage changes (APCs) in incidence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates from 2003 to 2007 were calculated by state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2002 to 2010, the percentage of persons aged 50-75 years who were adequately screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> increased from 52.3% to 65.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2007, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence ranged from 34.3 per 100,000 population in Utah to 56.9 in North Dakota; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates ranged from 12.3 per 100,000 in Utah to 21.1 in the District of Columbia (DC) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality have declined in recent years throughout the United States, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening has increased </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To ensure these gains continue, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening should be accessible and used as recommended by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eligible persons in the United States </plain></SENT>
