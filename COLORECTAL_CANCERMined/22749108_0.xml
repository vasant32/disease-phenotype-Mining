<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accuracy for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is as high as conventional colonoscopy (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> is size dependent, with large lesions (â‰¥10mm) accurately detected and small lesions (6-9mm) identified with moderate to good sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies show good sensitivity for the identification of nonpolypoid (flat) lesions as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current CTC indications include the evaluation of patients who had undergone a previous incomplete CC or those who are unfit for CC (elderly and frail individuals, patients with underlying severe clinical conditions, or with contraindication to sedation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CTC can also be efficiently used in the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> (excluding patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e>, where the exam should be postponed), before laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (to have an accurate localization of the lesion), in the evaluation of colonic involvement in the case of deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241880" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pelvic endometriosis</z:e> (replacing <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CTC is also a safe procedure in patients with colostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, CTC should be considered an opportunistic screening test (not available for population, or mass screening) to be offered to asymptomatic average-risk individuals, of both genders, starting at age 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use in individuals with positive family history should be discussed with the patient first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Absolute contraindication is to propose CTC for surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (in particular, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of CTC in the follow-up after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is achieving interesting evidences despite the fact that literature data are still relatively weak in terms of numerosity of the studied populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients who underwent previous polypectomy CTC cannot be recommended as first test because debate is still open </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is desirable that in the future CTC would be the first-line and only diagnostic test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic diseases</z:e>, leaving to CC only a therapeutic role </plain></SENT>
