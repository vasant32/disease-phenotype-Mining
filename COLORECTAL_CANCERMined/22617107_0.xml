<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore pursued the development of improved <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> transduction domains (MTDs) and tested their ability to deliver therapeutically active p18(INK4c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MTD103 was identified from a screen of 1,500 signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>; tested for the ability to promote protein uptake by cells and tissues; and analyzed with regard to the mechanism of protein uptake and the delivery of biologically active p18(INK4c) into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic potential of cell-permeable MTD103p18(INK4c) (CP-p18(INK4c)) was tested in the HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MTD103p18(INK4c) appeared to traverse plasma membranes directly, was transferred from cell-to-cell and was therapeutically effective against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> xenografts, inhibiting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> by 86-98% after 5 weeks (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic responses to CP-p18(INK4c) were accompanied by high levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to enhancing systemic delivery of CP-p18(INK4c) to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> xenografts, the MTD103 sequence delayed protein clearance from the blood, liver and spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> intracellular transduction technology (MITT), enabled by MTDs, may provide novel protein therapies against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and other diseases </plain></SENT>
