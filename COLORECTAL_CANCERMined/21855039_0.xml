<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The median survival for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) has progressively increased over the past decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the introduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU)-based chemotherapy, followed by hepatic resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, and more recently the adoption of newer chemotherapeutic regimens associated with targeted therapy, the gains are getting more substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the recognition of the potential for long-term survival after surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, long-term survival data to determine the potential curative role of chemotherapy alone is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 2751 patients who presented with mCRC at The MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center from 1990 through 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients alive at 5 years who achieved complete response with chemotherapy and were not submitted to any surgical or interventional procedures directed to the metastatic sites were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with mCRC during this period was 10.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these long-term survivors, 2.2% achieved a sustained complete response after chemotherapy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 with fluoropyrimidines and 2 with irinotecan) as the only treatment modality and were without evidence of disease until the last follow-up visit (median of 10.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This number corresponds to 0.24% (6 of 2541) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with mCRC included in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cure with chemotherapy alone is possible for a very small number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improved therapies are increasing complete response rates, but the impact of modern chemotherapy on durable complete responses will require additional follow up </plain></SENT>
