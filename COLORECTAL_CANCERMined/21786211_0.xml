<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The dosage regimen was as follows: <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 was given by 24-h <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 on day 1, followed by 24-h intravenous infusion of 5-FU on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This regimen was repeated every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 was escalated in five steps from 50 to 75, 100, 125, or 150 mg/m(2) (levels 1-5), whereas the dose of 5-FU was fixed at 800 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were recruited for this study, and 25 of the 26 patients were eligible for the assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DLTs of 24-h <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11/5-FU therapy included grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in 1 patient treated at level 1, and grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 1 patient and grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 1 patient at level 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In level 5, in 3 cases the next administration could not be done for 22 days or more as a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the level 5 was made a MTD and the level 4 was made a RD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main side effects of grade 3 or higher, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> occurred, were mild and tolerable in severity overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 24.0% (6PR/25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that 24-h <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11/5-FU therapy is feasible and effective for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
