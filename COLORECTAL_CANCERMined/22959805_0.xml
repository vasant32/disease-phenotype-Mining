<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSN functionalized with HA (MSN-HA) were more efficient than MSN without the targeting moiety when <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was performed at low fluence (14 Jcm(-2)) and low dosage of MSN (20 Î¼gmL(-1)) on HCT 116 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, known to over-express the CD44 receptor </plain></SENT>
