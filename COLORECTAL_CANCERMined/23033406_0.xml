<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the PAUC is defined as the area under the ROC curve within a restricted interval of false positive rates, it enables practitioners to quantify sensitivity rates within pre-specified specificity ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This issue is of considerable importance for the development of medical screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although many authors have highlighted the importance of PAUC, there exist only few methods that use the PAUC as an objective function for finding optimal combinations of biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we introduce a boosting method for deriving marker combinations that is explicitly based on the PAUC criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed method can be applied in high-dimensional settings where the number of biomarkers exceeds the number of observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the proposed method incorporates a recently proposed variable selection technique (stability selection) that results in sparse prediction rules incorporating only those biomarkers that make relevant contributions to predicting the outcome of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using both simulated data and real data, we demonstrate that our method performs well with respect to both variable selection and prediction accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, if the focus is on a limited range of specificity values, the new method results in better predictions than other established techniques for disease classification </plain></SENT>
