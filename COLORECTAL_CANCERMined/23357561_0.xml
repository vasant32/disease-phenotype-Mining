<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>National policy-making organizations recognize and support a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening strategies among average-risk adults aged 50 and older based on strong evidence showing that screening decreases mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and can also reduce the incidence of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to test a multi-level stepped intervention to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a group-randomized trial design where the units of assignment were clinics and the units of observation were eligible patients receiving care at those clinics, with stratified random assignment of clinics to study conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary analysis was planned as a mixed-model logistic regression to account for the expected positive intraclass correlation associated with clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our recruitment experience reflected the difficulties of conducting research in the real world where changes in economic conditions, staff turnover/layoff, inadequate medical records, and poor acceptance of research can significantly impact study plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It demonstrated the problems that can emerge when procedures used in the study depart from those used in the pilot work to generate parameter estimates for power analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also demonstrated the importance of allowing for attrition at the group and patient levels so that if recruitment <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> short, it is possible to maintain adequate power with only a slight increase in the detectable difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This experience should assist others planning group-randomized trials, whether in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening or in other areas </plain></SENT>
