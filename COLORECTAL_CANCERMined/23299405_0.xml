<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a case-control study including 2060 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> patients and 3336 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-free controls, we evaluated 21 functional genetic variants to construct a tobacco-carcinogen-metabolizing genetic risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data regarding cigarette smoking were obtained through telephone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking was associated with an elevated risk of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association with smoking was stronger in participants with a high carcinogen-metabolizing risk score than those with a low risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smoking 30 or more cigarettes per day was associated with a 1.7-fold elevated risk of any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (95% confidence interval = 1.3-2.2) among those with a low genetic risk score and 2.9-fold elevated risk (95% confidence interval = 1.8-4.8) among those with a high genetic risk score (P interaction = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of interaction was observed in analyses conducted separately for those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> only (P interaction = 0.039) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> only (P interaction = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interaction between carcinogen-metabolizing genetic risk and cigarette smoking was found in relation to high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (P interaction = 0.010) but not low-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (P interaction = 0.791) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No apparent interaction was found for duration of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study shows that the association between cigarette smoking and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> risk is modified by tobacco-carcinogen-metabolizing polymorphisms, providing support for a causal role of cigarette smoking in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
