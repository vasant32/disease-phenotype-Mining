<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The objective was to determine the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> capacity and morbidity and mortality rates after major hepatectomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in patients having undergone bevacizumab-based chemotherapy (bev+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2011, 41 patients underwent major hepatectomy within 3 months of bevacizumab and were matched with 41 patients operated on following systemic chemotherapy without bevacizumab (bev-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The matching criteria were the following: number of courses of chemotherapy, chemotherapy-free interval, age, and type of hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After measurements of remnant liver volume (RLV) preoperatively and at 1 month (RLV1M), volumetric gain was calculated as absolute (RLV1M-RLV) or relative regeneration [(RLV1M-RLV/RLV)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-day morbidity was rated according to the Clavien-Dindo classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 21 right, 9 extended right, and 11 left hepatectomies in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Groups were comparable in terms of matching criteria, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and RLV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mortalities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no intergroup differences in overall morbidity (56% in bev+ vs 34.1%; P = 0.075) or postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A severe complication occurred in 5 bev+ (4 eviscerations) and 4 bev- (bile leakages) (P = 0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay was similar in both groups as were the degrees of absolute and relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> (143% in bev+ vs 114%; P = 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Liver regeneration</z:e> was not influenced by the type of hepatectomy, the number of courses of chemotherapy, or age more than 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a methodologically robust trial in the largest cohort reported up to date, bevacizumab did not impair <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> after major hepatectomy-even in elderly patients or those with high exposure to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
