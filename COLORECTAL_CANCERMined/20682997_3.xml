<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RUNX3 promoter hypermethylation is associated with many types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the RUNX3 promotor is one of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-specific promotors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CIMP is a distinct phenotype associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the suitability of the quantitative analysis of RUNX3 promoter hypermethylation as a novel serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we investigated the relationship between RUNX3 promoter methylation and MSI in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A RUNX3 real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RTQ-MSP) technique we developed was used to analyze the CpG sites in the RUNX3 promoter of 119 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and 344 sera from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSI analysis of 119 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was performed with five microsatellite markers (BAT25, BAT26, D5S346, D2S123, and D17S250) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> exhibited significantly higher RUNX3 methylation than their paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues (p=0.0438) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the clinicopathological parameters revealed that a proximal location (p=0.0054), lymphatic invasion (p&lt;0.0001), and an advanced pathological stage (p=0.0018) were associated with significantly higher RUNX3 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the relationship between RUNX3 methylation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> MSI revealed 11 out of 13 tumors with high-frequency MSI (85%) were positive for RUNX3 hypermethylation, significantly more than the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with low-frequency MSI or which were microsatellite stable (34%, p=0.0070) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In preoperative sera from 344 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, significantly higher RUNX3 methylation was associated with lymphatic invasion (p=0.0487) and an advanced pathological stage (p=0.0466) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-operative follow-up data revealed that recurrence cases exhibited significantly higher preoperative serum RUNX3 methylation than non-recurrence cases (p=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Concomitant analysis of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the preoperative sera showed that 17.7% (61/344) were CEA-negative but RUNX3 methylation-positive, which means assessing both serum RUNX3 methylation and CEA should improve diagnosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RTQ-MSP-based quantification of serum RUNX3 methylation is useful for the detection and monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
