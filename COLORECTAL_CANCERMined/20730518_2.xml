<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that high soluble Hsp70 (sHsp70) level was a significant predictor of mortality during an almost 3-year-long follow-up period in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This association was the strongest in the group of &lt;70-year-old female patients as well as in those who were in a less advanced stage of the disease at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to these observations, measurement of the serum level of sHsp70 is a useful, stage-independent prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially in patients without distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since many literature data indicated that measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins (APPs) may also be suitable for predicting the mortality of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, it seemed reasonable to study whether the effect of sHsp70 and other APPs are related or independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to answer this question, we measured the concentrations of CRP as well as of other complement-related APPs (C1 inhibitor, C3, and C9) along with that of the MASP-2 complement component in the sera of 175 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and known levels of sHsp70, which have been used in our previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High (above median) levels of CRP, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), and sHsp70 were found to be independently associated with poor patient survival, whereas no such association was observed with the other proteins tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis, the additive effect of high sHsp70, CRP, and C1-INH levels on the survival of patients exceeded that of high sHsp70 alone, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.83 (1.13-70.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some subgroups of patients, such as in females [HR 4.80 (1.07-21.60)] or in â‰¤70-year-old patients [HR 11.53 (2.78-47.70)], even greater differences were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the clinical mortality-prediction value of combined measurements of sHsp70, CRP, and C1-INH with inexpensive methods can be very high, especially in specific subgroups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
