<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gap junctional intercellular communication is often lost in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> due to aberrant localization or downregulation of connexins, and connexins are therefore suggested to act as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes in various tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern and DNA promoter methylation status of connexins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of six (GJA1, GJA9, GJB1, GJB2, GJC1 and GJD3) connexin genes was detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GJC1 expression was reduced in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> analyzed connexins were hypermethylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, although at various frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GJA4, GJB6 and GJD2 were hypermethylated in 60% (29/48), 25% (12/48) and 96% (46/48) of primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the methylation status was not associated with gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GJC1 has two alternative promoters, which were methylated in 42% (32/76) and 38% (25/65) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, and in none of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of GJC1 was significantly lower in methylated compared with unmethylated samples (p &lt; 0.01) and was restored in cell lines treated with the demethylating drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'deoxycytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, DNA hypermethylation of the promoter region of GJC1, encoding connexin45, is an important mechanism in silencing gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
