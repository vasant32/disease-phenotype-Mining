<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional and correlational </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> and surgical outpatient clinics of a medical center in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE: 124 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who had completed active treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected using a set of structured questionnaires to explore type D personality, biophysical and psychological factors, and QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their associations were verified with Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's rho correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant factors associated with QOL were identified with generalized estimating equations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Type D personality and QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Patients with type D personality experienced higher physical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> than those with non-type D personality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Social inhibition remained an important factor leading to impairment in the mental component of QOL after controlling for other associated factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Negative affectivity was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> intensity and interference of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> with life activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Personality trait was found to be an important factor associated with QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The trait of social inhibition was a significant factor influencing mental aspects of QOL, whereas negative affectivity was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Assessing patients' personality, including negative affectivity and social inhibition, could help nurses to develop supportive groups or social networks for these patients and thereby improve QOL for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
