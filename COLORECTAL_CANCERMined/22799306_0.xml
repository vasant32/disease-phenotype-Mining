<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies concerning the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in Asian populations generated conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was therefore performed to allow a more reliable estimate of any link </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Relevant studies concerning the association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were included into this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The quality of the studies was assessed according to a predefined scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined for this gene-disease association using fixed or random effect models according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between included studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Finally, 21 studies with a total of 6692 cases and 8266 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses showed that there was an obvious association of the MTHFR 677T allele with decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 0.91, 95%CI=0.85-0.98, P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses by country further identified this association, with dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> as the main source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The MTHFR 677T allele is associated with a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Asian populations, and there is effect modification by population plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
