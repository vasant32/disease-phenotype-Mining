<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The number of people surviving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has doubled in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While much of the literature suggests that most people return to near pre-diagnosis status following surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, this literature has largely focused on physical side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have either been small scale or taken a narrow focus on recovery after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is a need for a comprehensive, long-term study exploring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of health and wellbeing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to establish the natural history of health and wellbeing in people who have been treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>People have different dispositions, supports and resources, likely resulting in individual differences in restoration of health and wellbeing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protocol described in this paper is of a study which will identify who is most at risk of problems, assess how quickly people return to a state of subjective health and wellbeing, and will measure factors which influence the course of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study following 1000 people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> over a period of two years, recruiting from 30 NHS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment centres across the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires will be administered prior to surgery, and 3, 9, 15 and 24 months after surgery, with the potential to return to this cohort to explore on-going issues related to recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Outcomes will help inform health care providers about what helps or hinders rapid and effective recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and identify areas for intervention development to aid this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Once established the cohort can be followed up for longer periods and be approached to participate in related projects as appropriate and subject to funding </plain></SENT>
