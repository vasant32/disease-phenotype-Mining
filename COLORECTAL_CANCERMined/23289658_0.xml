<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, to inform effective interventions and policies to increase screening rates and thus ameliorate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> disparities, this study's purpose was to examine barriers and facilitators to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among low-income, rural eastern North Carolina residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted 4 focus group discussions in October and November 2011, among a convenience sample of eastern North Carolina residents (n = 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The focus group discussion guide included open-ended questions about barriers and facilitators to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discussions were audio recorded and then transcribed verbatim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A codebook <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> codes and operational definitions was developed by 2 research team members, who then iteratively and independently double-coded <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nvivo (version 9, QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) was used to manage data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Themes were extracted based upon depth and frequency of mention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Major barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening included the high cost of tests and follow-up care, fear of the test itself (colonoscopy), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233705" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of cancer</z:e> diagnosis, and fear of burdening family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Violation (among men) and embarrassment (among women) were also barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Facilitators included doctor's recommendation, symptoms, support from family and friends, and the desire to live a long and healthy life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intervention ideas included free tests with information and resources for follow-up care as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Understanding barriers and facilitators to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening can assist clinicians and public health practitioners in designing effective interventions to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> disparities </plain></SENT>
