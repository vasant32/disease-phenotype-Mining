<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify novel genetic markers predictive of clinical benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor-directed antibody therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six consecutive patients who received cetuximab or panitumumab, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy and with available <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> tissue was tested by pyrosequencing for mutations at known hot spots in the KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT1, and PTEN genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTEN promoter methylation status was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients had 4 weeks of therapy and were considered for clinical correlates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, KRAS gene mutations were associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS, preservation of PTEN expression and PIK3CA <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> status was associated with improved OS (median OS, 80.4 vs. 32.5 weeks; hazard ratio, 0.33; P = .0008) and a trend toward improved PFS (median PFS, 24.8 vs. 15.2 weeks; hazard ratio, 0.51; P = .06), compared with PTEN-negative or PIK3CA-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PTEN methylation was more common in the metastatic samples than in the primary samples (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous presence of methylation and mutation in the PTEN gene was associated with IHC negativity (P = .026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In addition to KRAS mutation, loss of PTEN expression (by IHC) and PIK3CA mutation is likely to be predictive of a lack of benefit to anti-EGFR therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PTEN promoter methylation and mutation status was predictive of PTEN expression and may be used as an alternative means of predicting response to EGFR-targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
