<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background:Recent therapeutic developments demand for an update of information on natural history, risk factors and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) of colorectal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, prospective registry data should provide information about incidence, predictors and outcome.Methods:From a prospectively expanded single-institutional database with 2406 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), clinical, histological and survival data were analysed for independent risk factors and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings were then stratified to the era of treatment without chemotherapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi>-only and contemporary systemic chemotherapy, respectively.Results:Overall, 256 (10.6%) patients were diagnosed with PC thereof 141 (5.85%) with metachronous PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for the development of metachronous PC were age &lt;62 years, N2-status, T4-status, location of the primary in the left colon or appendix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the era of contemporary systemic chemotherapy, prognosis for PC improved only not-significantly (median survival of 17.9 months vs 7.03 months, P=0.054).Conclusion:Despite improvement in the overall outcome with prolonged median survival for the complete patient cohort with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, those patients with PC have not experienced the same benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the era of contemporary systemic chemotherapy, progress in treatment resulted in only limited survival benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, continuous efforts for further therapeutic advancements should be undertaken in these patients diagnosed with PC.British Journal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> advance online publication, 19 March 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.82 www.bjcancer.com </plain></SENT>
