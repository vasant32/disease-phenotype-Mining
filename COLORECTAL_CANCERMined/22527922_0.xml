<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> may be underdiagnosed as high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISM</z:e> is not identified in the preoperative biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features that are associated with missing the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISM</z:e> in biopsy specimens of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred and sixteen patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 2007 and December 2008 with well-preserved preoperative biopsy specimens were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and eleven patients had an isolated lesion, and five had two lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were reevaluated by two senior pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic features, biopsy pathology and surgical pathology results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISM</z:e> was identified in 216 cases (67.3 %) by biopsy-based pathological examination, and missed in 105 (32.7 %) cases, 72 of which were diagnosed as HGIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis indicated that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with smaller biopsy specimens (P = 0.042), mucinous or signet-ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (P = 0.003), higher WHO <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (P = 0.001) and positive lymph nodes (P = 0.011), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISM</z:e> was more likely to be missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward an increased diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISM</z:e> with the increase in the number of biopsy specimens (P = 0.105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate logistic regression analysis, smaller biopsy specimens (OR, 1.810; 95 % CI, 1.081-3.032; P = 0.024) and higher WHO <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (OR, 2.073; 95 % CI, 1.046-4.107; P = 0.037) were the only factors associated with failure to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large number of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are at risk of being underdiagnosed as HGIN by biopsy-based pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The smaller the biopsy size, the less likely it is that the muscularis mucosae is included in the specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Also, in the more advanced or aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISM</z:e> is more likely to be missed on biopsy, which may be due to the destruction of the muscularis mucosae by more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262472" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">aggressive cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
