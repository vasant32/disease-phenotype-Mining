<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening behaviors are often overreported and may lead to biased estimates of prevalence and of subgroup differences in screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the tendency to give socially desirable responses was associated with concordance between self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening behaviors and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary care patients (n = 857) age 50 to 74 years completed a mail, face-to-face, or telephone survey that assessed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and social desirability measured by a short version of the Marlowe-Crowne scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used medical records to verify self-reports of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Social desirability scores were lower for whites versus African Americans, college graduates, and patients reporting no prior screening tests; they were higher for telephone versus mail or face-to-face survey respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariable logistic regression analysis, social desirability scores were not associated with concordance for FOBT (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.94-1.13), sigmoidoscopy (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.86-1.04), or colonoscopy (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.88-1.11); however, lower social desirability scores were associated with increased concordance for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.77-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses, no associations were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Social desirability as measured by the Marlowe-Crowne scale was not associated with accuracy of self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tests in our sample, suggesting that other explanations for overreporting need to be explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: By understanding sources of response bias, we can improve the accuracy of self-report measures </plain></SENT>
