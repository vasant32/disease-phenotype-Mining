<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize autophagy in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human intestinal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the expression of LC3-II and BECN1 as well as SQSTM1 as markers of autophagy activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human intestinal epithelial crypt (HIEC) cell experimental model, we found that autophagy was much more active in undifferentiated cells than in differentiated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult colonic mucosa, BECN1 was found in the proliferative epithelial cells of the lower part of the gland while SQSTM1 was predominantly found in the differentiated cells of the upper part of the gland and surface epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the weak punctate pattern of SQSTM1 expression in the lower gland colocalized with BECN1-labeled autophagosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of SQSTM1 as an active autophagy marker was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> specimens at the protein and transcript levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results show that autophagy is active in the colonic gland and is associated with the intestinal proliferative/undifferentiated and progenitor cell populations </plain></SENT>
