<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab was approved in 2004 as a first-line treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in combination with chemotherapy and provided proof of principle for antiangiogenic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is no biomarker that can help to select patients who may benefit from bevacizumab in order to improve cost-effectiveness and therapeutic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare gene expression profiles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients treated with bevacizumab who responded to the treatment with those that did not respond, in an effort to identify potential predictive biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens of patients treated with bevacizumab was subjected to gene expression analysis with quantitative RT-PCR arrays profiling 84 genes implicated in the angiogenic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were validated at the protein level using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified a gene, EPHB4, whose expression was significantly increased in nonresponders (p = 0.048, Mann-Whitney test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, high EPHB4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> levels were associated with decreased median overall survival (16 months vs 48, Log-rank p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was not observed in a control group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients treated only with chemotherapy, suggesting that EPHB4 constitutes a potential predictive biomarker and not a mere prognostic one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data support the notion of a potential synergy between EPHB4-EFNB2 and VEGF-VEGFR pathways, making patients with high EPHB4 expression more resistant to VEGF blocking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, determination of EPHB4 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples could be useful for the prediction of response to bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
