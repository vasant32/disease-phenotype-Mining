<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) based shotgun proteomics approach, we identified 1140 unique proteins, out of which 147 were found to be significantly altered in the metastatic cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ingenuity pathway analysis with those significantly altered proteins, revealed cellular organization and assembly as the top-ranked altered biological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differential expression pattern of 6 candidate proteins were validated by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these, the low expression level of β-catenin combined with the up-regulation of CacyBP (Calcyclin binding Protein), a β-catenin degrading protein, in the metastatic cell provided a rational guide for the downstream functional assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative expression pattern of these two proteins was further validated in three other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells by Western blot and quantitative immunofluorescence studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of CacyBP in three different primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines showed significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> characteristics as well as cellular β-catenin level as confirmed by our experiments, indicating the possible involvement of CacyBP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In short, this study demonstrates successful application of a quantitative proteomics approach to identify novel key players for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, which may serve as biomarkers and/or drug targets to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
