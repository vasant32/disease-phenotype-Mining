<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the effects of TAGLN on the characteristics of LoVo cells were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expressions of TAGLN in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues, adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, and LoVo cells were detected by the Western blot method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-TAGLN was established and transfected into LoVo cells with the help of Lipofectamine™ 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the TAGLN siRNA was transfected into LoVo cells in another group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours later, the expressions of TAGLN in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were assayed by Western blot, and the cell viability was analyzed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle and cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were examined by flow cytometry, and the cell invasive ability was analyzed by Transwell invasion experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of TALGN on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) was detected by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that the expressions of TALGN in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues and LoVo cells were significantly decreased compared with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the overexpression or RNAi experiments, the plasmid pcDNA3.1-TAGLN significantly enhanced TALGN expression (p &lt; 0.01), and TAGLN siRNA significantly decreased TAGLN expression (p &lt; 0.01) in LoVo cells 48 h after transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay indicated that the cell viability of LoVo cells in the pcDNA3.1-TAGLN transfection group was significantly lower than that in the untransfected control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the overexpression of TAGLN significantly lowered the cell proliferation index (p &lt; 0.05) and improved cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (p &lt; 0.01) in LoVo cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In Transwell invasive experiments, the cell number, which had migrated through the chamber membrane, significantly decreased in the pcDNA3.1-TAGLN transfection group (p &lt; 0.05) and significantly increased in the TAGLN knockdown group (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the untransfected control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the expression of MMP9 was notably inhibited in the pcDNA3.1-TAGLN transfection group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The expressions of TAGLN were inhibited in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> LoVo cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The study also demonstrated that TAGLN could attenuate the proliferation and invasive ability of LoVo cells and enhance LoVo cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of MMP9 was also inhibited by TAGLN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these results could bring us a new perspective for biological therapy in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
