<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) could be one possible explanation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining this issue.METHODS:We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic (through July 2012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible studies were cross-sectional surveys, cohort studies, or case-control studies reporting the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For cross-sectional surveys and cohort studies, we recorded number of subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> status, and for case-control studies, number of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> status were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study quality was assessed according to published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were pooled using a random effects model, and the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> was summarized using an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).RESULTS:The search strategy identified 2,282 citations, of which 28 were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eight cross-sectional surveys, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> as the primary indication for colonoscopy was associated with a lower prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR=0.56; 95% CI 0.36-0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward a reduction in odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> in three cohort studies (OR=0.80; 95% CI 0.61-1.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was significantly higher than in controls without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 17 case-control studies (OR=1.68; 95% CI 1.29-2.18), but with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and possible publication bias.CONCLUSIONS:Prospective cross-sectional surveys and cohort studies demonstrate no increase in prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients or individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
