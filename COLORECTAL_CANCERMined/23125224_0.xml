<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that genes regulating the cell cycle influence the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> as cell cycle-related genes respond to DNA damage by arresting the cell cycle to provide time for repair and induce transcription of genes that facilitate repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of 1456 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 128 cell cycle-related genes and 31 DNA repair-related genes in 485 non-Hispanic white participants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> to determine whether there are SNPs associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed on an Illumina GoldenGate platform, and data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression analysis and classification and regression tree (CART) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten SNPs were independently significant in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model after correcting for multiple comparisons (P &lt; 5 Ã— 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, risk modeling using CART analysis defined combinations of genotypes for these SNPs with which subjects could be classified into low-risk, moderate-risk and high-risk groups that had median ages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 63, 50 and 42 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-associated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the high-risk group was more than four times the risk in the low-risk group (hazard ratio = 4.67, 95% CI = 3.16-6.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The additional genetic markers identified may help in refining risk groups for more tailored screening and follow-up of non-Hispanic white patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
