<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated uptake rates and outcomes of faecal immunochemical test (FIT) and Guaiac test (gFOBT) kits as part of a two-step <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 3-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program for a defined population of construction workers was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those satisfying the inclusion criteria were provided with gFOBT or FIT kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals testing positive were invited for a colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 909 faecal testing kits were distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age range was 53-60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compliance rate was higher for FIT (58.3%) as compared to gFOBT (46.7%) (p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FIT detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 37.5 and 25%, respectively, whereas; gFOBT detected 23.5 and 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopies were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 53 and 25% tested positive by gFOBT and FIT, respectively (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FIT was more cost-effective when compared with gFOBT with higher return rate, sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A comparative study of faecal occult blood kits in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program in a healthy cohort of construction workers </plain></SENT>
