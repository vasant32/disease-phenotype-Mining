<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To find out if the hepatic transit time (HTT) shortening, which was already proven in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> by other modalities, can also be detected with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Patient group consisted of 20 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the control group of 21 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline and post contrast images were acquired before and after administration of Gd-BOPTA, using a T1-weighted bolus test sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arrival times (AT) of the contrast agent for the aorta, the hepatic artery, the portal vein and one hepatic vein were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on arrival time measurements HTT were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> analyses showed significantly shorter HTT in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> compared with healthy volunteers (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no false positives using a threshold of 10.4 s for arterial to venous HTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For aortal to venous and portal to venous HTT a threshold of 12.5 s and 4 s was calculated, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation between HTT and involved liver segments, overall volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> or subject age was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that HTT measurements using contrast enhanced MRI with Gd-BOPTA can detect hemodynamic changes due to metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
