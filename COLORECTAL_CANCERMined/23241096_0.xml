<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date the Danish version of the questionnaire has not been validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Danish version of EORTC QLQ-CR38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EORTC QLQ-CR38 was administered to 190 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in two Danish hospitals, one month after their operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire's structure, reliability, convergent, divergent and known-groups validity was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 164 (86.3%) patients were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Danish version of EORTC QLQ-CR38 showed satisfactory psychometric properties for the scales: body image, sexual functioning, male <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problems</z:e> and defecations problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Suboptimal psychometric performances were found for the scales: micturition problems, symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the psychometric properties of the scale chemotherapy side effects was limited by the low number of patients receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was not possible to assess the psychometric properties of the scale female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problems</z:e> and the single item sexual enjoyment due to a high number of missing values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The homogeneity of the study population made the evaluation of known-group validity difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the validity of the Danish version of EORTC QLQ-CR38 is acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the results support the appropriateness of the updated version, the EORTC QLQ-CR29 </plain></SENT>
