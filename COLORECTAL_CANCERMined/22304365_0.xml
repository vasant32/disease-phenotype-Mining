<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The detection of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells (CTC) is becoming a promising alternative to current detection techniques, as it focuses on one of the players of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> and it should provide with more specific and sensitive detection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe an improved method of detection of CTC from mCRC patients by combining immune-enrichment, optimal purification of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from very low cell numbers, and the selection of accurate PCR probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, we obtained a logistic model that combines GAPDH and VIL1 normalized to CD45 rendering powerful results in the detection of CTC from mCRC patients (AUROC value 0.8599) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated the utility of this model at the clinical setting, as a reliable prognosis tool to determine progression-free survival in mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, we developed a strategy that ameliorates the specificity and sensitivity in the detection of CTC, resulting in a robust and promising logistic model for the clinical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
