<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may be treated with a curative intent by cytoreductive surgery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of perioperative systemic chemotherapy for this particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty patients with PC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were consecutively treated by 131 procedures combining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> with HIPEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response to neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy was assessed on data from previous explorative surgery and/or radiological imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety patients (75%) were treated with neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy in whom 32 (36%) were considered to have responded, 19 (21%) had stable disease, and 19 (21%) developed diseases progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response could not be evaluated in 20 patients (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, the use of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy had a significant positive prognostic influence (P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the completeness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and the use of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy were the only significant prognostic factors (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.049, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response to neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy had no significant prognostic impact with median survival of 31.4 months in patients showing disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> without extraperitoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, failure of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy should not constitute an absolute contraindication to a curative procedure combining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and HIPEC </plain></SENT>
