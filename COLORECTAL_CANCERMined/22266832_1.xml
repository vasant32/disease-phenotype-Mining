<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: MDM2 was originally identified as an oncoprotein that binds to p53 and inhibits p53-mediated transactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scientists have described functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the MDM2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They showed that the genotype of SNP 309 induces an increase in the level of MDM2 protein, which causes attenuation of the p53 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to investigate whether this polymorphism was related to risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and whether there were relationships between SNP 309 and protein expression or clinicopathological variables in Tunisian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the effect of this polymorphism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> pathogenesis, we genotyped 167 patients and 167 blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rates of MDM2 genotypes were 6.6% for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (T/T) and 93.4% for the SNP 309 polymorphic genotype (T/G and G/G) in patients and 38.3 and 61.7% in controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the frequencies of genotypes between patients and controls (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not find any relationship between genotypes and clinicopathological features of patients, except in the case of the nonmucinous histological subtype (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that patients with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype (T/T) had significantly more favorable clinical outcome than did patients with the SNP 309 genotype (T/G, G/G) (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found an association between positive expression of p53 and polymorphic genotypes of MDM2 (T/G, G/G) (P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between tumoral immunostaning and MDM2 polymorphism (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the MDM2 polymorphism is significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk and may provide useful prognostic information for Tunisian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
