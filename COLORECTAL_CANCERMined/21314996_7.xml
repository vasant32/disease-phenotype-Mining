<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ten chromosomal loci have been shown to predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A plausible biological mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility associated with genetic variation has so far only been proposed for three loci, each pointing to variants that affect gene expression through distant regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to gain insight into the molecular basis of seven low-penetrance <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> loci tagged by rs4779584 at 15q13, rs10795668 at 10p14, rs3802842 at 11q23, rs4444235 at 14q22, rs9929218 at 16q22, rs10411210 at 19q13, and rs961253 at 20p12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Possible somatic gain of the risk allele or loss of the protective allele was studied by analyzing allelic imbalance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue samples of heterozygous patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional variants were searched from in silico predicted enhancer elements locating inside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-associating linkage-disequilibrium regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No allelic imbalance targeting the SNPs was observed at any of the seven loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 12 SNPs that were predicted to disrupt potential transcription factor binding sequences were genotyped in the same population-based case-control series as the seven tagging SNPs originally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None showed association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the allelic imbalance analysis suggest that the seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk variants are not somatically selected for in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The bioinformatic approach was unable to pinpoint <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-causing variants at any of the seven loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While it is possible that many of the predisposition loci for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are involved in control of gene expression by targeting transcription factor binding sites, also other possibilities, such as regulatory <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, should be considered </plain></SENT>
