<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> cells from patients have been used as a model for assessment of drug response for individual patients, this study aims to evaluate the reliability of such a model in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in predicting the response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues through comparison of their expression profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Establishment of primary cultures from tissues obtained surgically from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients allowed us to study the gene expression differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues as well as primary cultures derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tissues comparison highlights the molecular characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, while the comparison between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> cells versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues allowed us to identify alterations associated with the establishment of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genes-drug association analyses allowed us to fine-tune our expectations while using primary culture as a model for drug assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparison between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cultures and original tissues through functional analyses showed the deregulations caused by culture establishment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Investigating the impact of such changes in genes-drug associations to identify the potential alterations in drug response, we found that primary cultures may have increased susceptibility toward paclitaxel, but reduced susceptibility toward analogues of fluorouracil compared with original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> cells toward different drugs is not linearly associated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results highlight the importance to account for the discrepancy in responses between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> cells and original counterparts in order to provide clinicians with important insights to improve selection of drugs for individual patients based on in vitro assays </plain></SENT>
