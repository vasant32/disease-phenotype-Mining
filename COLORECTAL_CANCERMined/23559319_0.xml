<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of such patients remains controversial without any evidence based organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic sequences are discussed including chemotherapy, colorectal surgery, liver resection and even radio-chemotherapy for some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case of resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, preoperative chemotherapy offers the advantage of earlier treatment of micro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> as well as evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responsiveness, which can help shape future therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this setting, different surgical strategies can be chosen (classical staged procedures with colorectal surgery followed by liver surgery, simultaneous resections or liver first approach) depending on the importance of the primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The literature remains limited, but the results of these strategies seem identical in term of postoperative morbidity and long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staged procedures are preferred in case of major liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> on the low or mid rectum will necessitate preoperative long course chemoradiotherapy and a more complex multidisciplinary organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients with extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, non-resectability must be assessed by experienced surgeon and radiologist before treatment and during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group of patients, improved chemotherapy regimen associated with targeted therapies and new surgical strategies (portal vein embolization, ablation, staged hepatectomiesâ€¦) have improved resection rate (15 to 30-40%) and long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment organization for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Resection of the primary to manage symptoms such as obstruction, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is advocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients with asymptomatic primary a non-surgical approach permits to begin rapidly chemotherapy and obtain a better control of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, initial resection of the primary may avoid complications and the need for urgent surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both of these strategies are practiced without definitive evidence supporting one treatment option over the other </plain></SENT>
