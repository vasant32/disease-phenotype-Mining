<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of studies on survivin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) have focused on protein expression and less is known about the expression of survivin splicing variants or survivin gene polymorphisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of the five known isoforms of survivin as well as survivin protein were assessed in matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic colorectal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the 9386 C/T and -31 G/C polymorphisms were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR was used to assess <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in fresh/frozen tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein levels were immunohistochemically evaluated on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals were genotyped using real time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 survivin splice variants as well as survivin protein was elevated in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specific splice variant expression differentially correlated with clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both snps correlated with splice variant levels or their ratios in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> while the -31 G/C snp may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development and improved overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results support a role of survivin in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> while the -31 G/C snp may constitute a marker of survival </plain></SENT>
