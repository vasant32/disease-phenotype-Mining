<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we performed a prospective multicenter study for verification of our previous findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were diagnosed with ECRC by endoscopy, and with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> from the biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven institutions affiliated with the Japanese Society for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer of the Colon</z:e> and Rectum participated in this collaborative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 112 patients with ECRC were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For nonpedunculated ECRCs, presence of DR was significantly correlated with SM depth </plain></SENT>
