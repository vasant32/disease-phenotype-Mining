<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the effects of Tcf-4 knockdown with β-catenin knockdown on cell proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and chemosensitivity in SW480 and HCT116 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells using adenoviral vector-mediated short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that, compared to β-catenin knockdown, Tcf-4 knockdown more effectively inhibited colony formation, induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and increased 5-FU and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-mediated cytotoxicity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further investigated the mechanisms involved in the different efficacies observed with β-catenin and Tcf-4 knockdown in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FOXO4 is a member of the subfamily of mammalian FOXO forkhead transcription factors and plays a major role in controlling cellular proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that the protein level of FOXO4 did not change after treatment with both β-catenin and Tcf-4 shRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, β-catenin shRNA was found to increase the accumulation of phosphorylated FOXO4 S193 and decrease the expression of FOXO target genes p27Kip1 and MnSOD, whereas Tcf-4 shRNA showed the opposite effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, compared to β-catenin knockdown, Tcf-4 knockdown shows better efficacy for inhibiting proliferation and inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, which may be related to increased FOXO4 transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Tcf-4 is an attractive potential therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
