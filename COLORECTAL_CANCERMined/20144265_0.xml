<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colon and rectal specimens were obtained from 26 patients with recurrent colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined COX-2 expression in human recurrent colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues using immunohistochemistry and quantative real-time PCR (qPCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> a strong cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining of COX-2 was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate to strong immunosignals were detected in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a strong specific staining of COX-2 in vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>COX-2 immunoreactivity was also detected in stromal cells such as mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The real-time PCR analyses demonstrated marked overexpression of the COX-2 gene in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mucosa in concert with the immunohistochemistry data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We investigated COX-2 expression at the level of its protein as well as its <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> in a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations give additional information about the possibility that COX-2 could be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519689" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor promotion</z:e> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
