<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, dysregulation of Wnt signalling contributes to the pathogenesis of many human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, in particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Core members of the Wnt signalling pathway are quite well defined, although it has become apparent that a much broader network of interacting proteins regulates Wnt signalling activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this paper is first to identify novel members of the Wnt regulatory network; and second, to identify sub-networks of the larger Wnt signalling network that are active in different biological contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We address these two questions using complementary computational approaches and show how these approaches may identify potentially novel Wnt signalling proteins as well as defining Wnt sub-networks active in different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
