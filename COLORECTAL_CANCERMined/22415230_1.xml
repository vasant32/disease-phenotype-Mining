<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laboratory studies suggest a possible role of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> but epidemiological evidence is inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We tested <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> hypothesis in the Nurses' Health Study, in which 85â€‰924 women free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in 1980 were followed until June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate multivariable relative risks (MV RRs, 95% confidence intervals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the age-adjusted model, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was significantly inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk; the RRs from lowest to highest decile of total <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake were 1.0 (ref), 0.93, 0.81, 0.72, 0.74, 0.77, 0.72, 0.75, 0.80, and 0.67 (P(trend)&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in the MV model adjusted for known dietary and non-dietary risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the association was significantly attenuated; the MV RRs were 1.0 (ref), 0.96, 0.85, 0.78, 0.82, 0.86, 0.84, 0.91, 1.02, and 0.93 (P(trend)=0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intakes were significantly inversely associated with concentrations of plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in age-adjusted model (P(trend)=0.002) but not in multivariate-adjusted model (P(trend)=0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results did not differ by subsite or modified by calcium intakes or body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These prospective results do not support an independent association of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk or plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels in women </plain></SENT>
