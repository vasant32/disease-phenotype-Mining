<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: In this study we explored the prognostic impact of synchronous bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy in female patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergoing radical surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: From 1991 to 2000, 267 female patients with stage II or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e>, who had undergone curative resection, were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 224 patients, the ovaries were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other 43 patients underwent synchronous bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses (Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression, respectively) were used to evaluate the effect of prophylactic oophorectomy and other clinical factors on the prognosis of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and adjuvant chemotherapy were the only two significant clinical factors that affected the 5-year overall survival of patients (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the 5-year overall survival between patients who had, or had not, undergone prophylactic oophorectomy (75%vs 73%, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis by adjuvant chemotherapy, the 5-year overall survival in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was similar between nonoophorectomy and oophorectomy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients without adjuvant chemotherapy, the oophorectomy group was shown to have a significantly better 5-year overall survival than the nonoophorectomy group (76%vs 51%, P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prophylactic oophorectomy may improve the overall survival of female patients with locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> without adjuvant chemotherapy, but its survival benefit vanished in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of prophylactic oophorectomy may be substituted by adjuvant chemotherapy, which makes prophylactic oophorectomy unnecessary during surgery for locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
