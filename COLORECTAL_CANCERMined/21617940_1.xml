<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A potentially functional polymorphism (designated as p73 G4C14-to-A4T14) has been identified in a region in exon 2 of the p73 gene, which may theoretically form a stem-loop structure and thereby affect p73 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several investigations have reported the correlation between p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the results are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further assess the association between p73 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, we performed meta-analysis of the data sets obtained from 26 individual studies involving 8,148 cancer patients and 8,150 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk was determined by crude odd ratios (OR) with 95% CI (confidential interval) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant association of p73 polymorphism with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk of smoking was detected by stratified analysis by smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, our data suggest that the p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 may be a risk factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> especially in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
