<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> spend most of their time in the community, but the role of primary care in their management and follow-up is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients' experiences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740697" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychosocial problems</z:e> and their management in primary and specialist care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal qualitative study of participants recruited from three hospitals in the west of Scotland and interviewed in their own homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In-depth interviews with 24 participants with a new diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and then follow-up interviews 12 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants' needs following a diagnosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> included physical, psychological, and social issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GPs played a key role in diagnosis, after which they were less involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants valued GPs making unsolicited contact and offering support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants described being well supported by clinical nurse specialists who are expert in the illness, and who provide continuity of care and psychological support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A year after diagnosis, when there was less contact with GPs and clinical nurse specialists, participants still faced challenges associated with the ongoing impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While some patients enjoyed straightforward recoveries from surgery, others experienced longer-term implications from their disease and treatment, particularly bowel-function issues, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
