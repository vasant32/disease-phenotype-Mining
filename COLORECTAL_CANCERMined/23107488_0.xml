<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this multicentre study was to assess the interobserver agreement in the visualization of the surface and margins of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and in distinguishing neoplastic from non-neoplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight expert endoscopists examined 400 mixed previously recorded images of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> taken with different Pentax i-Scan settings in order to give an evaluation of the surface of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> and regular colonic mucosa, the pit-pattern and the nature of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 400 mixed images of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> with a diameter &gt;5mm and &lt;10mm were stored for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was a K agreement of 0.370 (p&lt;0.001) and 0.306 (p&lt;0.001) regarding pit-pattern and margins, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The K agreement for the difference between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions was of 0.446 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed good interobserver agreement in the evaluation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions and poor agreement in the evaluation of pit-pattern and margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adequate training is required in order to interpret images acquired with the i-Scan technique </plain></SENT>
