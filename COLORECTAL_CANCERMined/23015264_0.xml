<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics associated with two cycles of hepatic embolization using DEBIRI followed by intravenous administration of irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pigs were embolized with DEBIRI (100-300 Î¼m, 100 mg dose, n = 6) and blood samples taken over 24 h to determine plasma levels of irinotecan and SN-38 metabolite and for haematology and biochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h an IV infusion of 250 mg/m(2) of irinotecan was administered and the plasma levels taken again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This cycle was repeated 3 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single animal was subjected to a more aggressive regimen of embolization with 200 mg bead dose and IV of 350 mg/m(2) for two cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks and the remaining four (n = 3 standard dose, n = 1 high dose) animals at 12 weeks and detailed histopathology performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals tolerated the treatments well, with only minor changes in haematological and biochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no overlap in drug plasma levels observed from the bead and IV treatments when given 24 h apart and no difference between the pharmacokinetic profiles of the two cycles separated by 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan plasma AUC values were similar in both the embolization and IV arms of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>C(max) values obtained during the IV arms of the study are approximately double that of the embolization arms whilst T(max) times are shorter in the IV arms, supporting extended release of drug from the beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bioavailability for bead-based delivery was double that for IV administration, which was attributed to reduced clearance of the drug when delivered by this route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No additive toxicity was observed as a consequence of the combined treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The combination of irinotecan delivery via drug eluting bead and IV was well-tolerated with no significant clinical effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest the bioavailability from bead-based delivery of drug is double that of IV infusion, attributable to reduced drug clearance for the former </plain></SENT>
