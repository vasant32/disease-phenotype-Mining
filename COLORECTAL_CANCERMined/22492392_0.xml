<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In dual-time-point PET/CT, early delayed scanning (D-1) just after the completion of whole body scanning (E) is easy to perform without additional radiation exposure and repositioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the clinical value of D-1 compared with conventional delayed scanning (D-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients with known or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The E scan at 1-h post-injection was followed by D-1 at 85 ± 7 min post-injection and D-2 at 124 ± 7 min post-injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical value of D-1 was evaluated by comparing diagnostic performance with D-2 for differentiating physiologic from pathological uptake and for staging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic findings, histopathological results and clinical follow-up including radiological findings were used as reference standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two, eight and 73 focal or short segmental FDG foci by physiologic processes in the colon/rectum, the small intestine and the ureter, respectively, noted in the E scan were evaluated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using D-1 and D-2, 14/32 (44%) and 17/32 (53%) in the colon/rectum, 5/8 (63%) and 8/8 (100%) in the small intestine, and 55/73 (75%) and 69/73 (95%) in the ureter, respectively, were accurately interpreted as physiologic with the change of intensity and/or shape/location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant difference between D-1 and D-2 was observed in the ureter, but not in the bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 55 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were finally diagnosed in 52 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, there were no significant differences among the three scans in the lesion-based detectability, the patient-based sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, nodal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e>, and dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neither D-1 nor D-2 improved staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, delayed scans yielded information useful for differentiating physiologic uptake from pathological uptake and D-1 may provide comparable efficacy with D-2 in the bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because of the ease of acquisition, the D-1 scan was considered a practical way to reduce false-positives in the abdomen and possibly helpful to avoid unnecessary additional invasive examinations, such as colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
