<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Informatics approaches combining structured EHR data, such as billing records, with narrative text data have demonstrated utility for such tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper describes an algorithm combining machine learning and natural language processing to detect patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) from entire EHRs at Vanderbilt University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a general case detection method that consists of two steps: 1) extraction of positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> concepts from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical notes (document-level concept identification); and 2) determination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases using aggregated information from both clinical narratives and structured billing data (patient-level case determination) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each step, we compared performance of rule-based and machine-learning-based approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a manually reviewed data set containing 300 possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (150 for training and 150 for testing), we showed that our method achieved F-measures of 0.996 for document level concept identification, and 0.93 for patient level case detection </plain></SENT>
