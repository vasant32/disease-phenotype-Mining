<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effect of participating in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening programme on quality of life (QOL), neither for participants with a negative nor for those with a positive test result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings, however, are important to evaluate the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening trials were sent a questionnaire, which included validated measures on generic health-related QOL, generic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and screen-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both faecal immunochemical test (FIT) and flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) participants, either with negative or positive test results, were addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 73% (1289 out of 1772) for FIT and 78% (536 out of 689) for FS participants, with mean ages varying from 63-66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive FIT participants had worse physical (PCS-12, 47.1 vs 48.3, P=0.02), but equal mental QOL scores (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>-12, 51.1 vs 51.6, P=0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative FS participants had similar QOL scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both FIT and FS participants with a positive test result reported more screen-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> than negative FIT and FS participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative FS participants had similar generic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the burden of participating in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening may be limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conducting a prospective study to confirm these results is recommended </plain></SENT>
