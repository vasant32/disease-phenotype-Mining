<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism through which soluble endoglin is released from the placenta is currently unknown; however, recent work in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> identified matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP-14) as the cleavage protease of endoglin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether this is also the mechanism responsible for soluble endoglin release in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, we investigated the expression of MMP-14 within the placenta and the effects of its inhibition on soluble endoglin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Placentas were obtained from severe, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> preeclamptic pregnancies (n = 8) and gestationally matched preterm controls (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMP-14 was predominately localized to the syncytiotrophoblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results from a proximity ligation assay showed protein interactions between endogenous MMP-14 and endoglin within the preeclamptic placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate that this interaction produces soluble endoglin, we treated trophoblastic BeWo cells with either a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor (GM6001) or MMP-14 siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both treatments produced a decrease in soluble endoglin (P ≤ 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of mice bearing BeWo xenografts with GM6001 decreased circulating soluble endoglin levels in mouse serum (P ≤ 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that MMP-14 is the likely cleavage protease of endoglin in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This approach provides a novel method for the development of potential therapeutics to reduce circulating soluble endoglin and ameliorate the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
