<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2006, the federal government introduced a screening program consisting of a one-off fecal occult blood test offered to people turning 50, 55, or 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a population-based study to estimate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening practices existing outside the current program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1887 unaffected subjects categorized "at or slightly above average risk" of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were selected from the Australasian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Family Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated the proportions of participants that reported appropriate, under- and over-screening according to national guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed a logistic regression analysis to evaluate associations between over-screening and a set of socio-demographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 532 participants at average risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, eligible for screening, 4 (0.75 %) reported appropriate screening, 479 (90 %) reported never having been screened, 18 (3 %) reported some but less than appropriate screening, and 31 (6 %) reported over-screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 412 participants aged 50 years or over, slightly above average risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 1 participant (0.25 %) reported appropriate screening, 316 (77 %) reported no screening, and 11 (3 %) reported some but less than appropriate screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among participants under age 50 years, 2 % of those at average risk and 10 % of those slightly above average risk reported over-screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Middle-aged people, those with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and those with a university degree, were more likely to be over-screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening participation was low and the vast majority of screening tests undertaken were inappropriate in terms of timing, modality, or frequency </plain></SENT>
