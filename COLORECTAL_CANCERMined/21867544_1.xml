<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Populations having lower socioeconomic status, as well as ethnic minorities, have demonstrated lower utilization of preventive screening, including tests for early detection of breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>THE OBJECTIVE: To explore socio-demographic disparities in adherence to screening recommendations for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted by Maccabi Healthcare Services, an Israeli HMO (health plan) providing healthcare services to 1.9 million members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Utilization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (BC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (CC) screening were analyzed by socio-economic ranks (SERs), ethnicity (Arab vs non-Arab), immigration status and ownership of voluntarily supplemental health insurance (VSHI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data on 157,928 and 303,330 adults, eligible for BC and CC screening, respectively, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those having lower SER, Arabs, immigrants from Former Soviet Union countries and non-owners of VSHI performed fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening examinations compared with those having higher SER, non-Arabs, veterans and owners of VSHI (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression model for BC Screening revealed a positive association with age and ownership of VSHI and a negative association with being an Arab and having a lower SER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model for CC screening revealed a positive association with age and ownership of VSHI and a negative association with being an Arab, having a lower SER and being an immigrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The model estimated for BC and CC screening among females revealed a positive association with age and ownership of VSHI and a negative association with being an Arab, having a lower SER and being an immigrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients from low socio-economic backgrounds, Arabs, immigrants and those who do not own supplemental insurance do fewer tests for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These sub-populations should be considered priority populations for targeted intervention programs and improved resource allocation </plain></SENT>
