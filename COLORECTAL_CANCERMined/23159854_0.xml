<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NGAL can stabilize matrix metalloproteinase-9 from autodegradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NGAL is considered as a siderocalin that is important in the transport of iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NGAL expression has also been associated with certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> and is implicated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we examined whether ectopic NGAL expression would alter the sensitivity of breast epithelial, breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells to the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While abundant NGAL expression was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells infected with a retrovirus encoding NGAL, this expression did not alter the sensitivity of these cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> as compared with empty vector-transduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We were also interested in determining the effects of ectopic NGAL expression on the sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors targeting key signaling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ectopic NGAL expression increased the sensitivity of MCF-7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells to EGFR, Bcl-2 and calmodulin kinase inhibitors as well as the natural plant product <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when suboptimal concentrations of certain inhibitors were combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, a reduction in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> IC 50 was frequently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An exception was observed when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> was combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi>, as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> suppressed the sensitivity of the NGAL-transduced MCF-7 cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> when compared with the empty vector controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, changes in the sensitivities of the NGAL-transduced HT-29 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell line and the breast epithelial MCF-10A cell line were not detected compared with empty vector-transduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi>-resistant MCF-7/Dox (R) cells were examined in these experiments as a control drug-resistant line; it displayed increased sensitivity to EGFR and Bcl-2 inhibitors compared with empty vector transduced MCF-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that NGAL expression can alter the sensitivity of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells to small-molecule inhibitors, suggesting that patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> exhibit elevated NGAL expression or have become drug-resistant may display altered responses to certain small-molecule inhibitors </plain></SENT>
