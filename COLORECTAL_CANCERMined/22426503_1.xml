<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The improvement in survival for patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> has highlighted the need for valid and reliable assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper was to explore neuropathic symptoms in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-treated patients as assessed using different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive symptomatic patients reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were interviewed using a semi-structured clinical interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxicity was also assessed using the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Toxicity Criteria scale (clinician-rated), patient 'self-report' questionnaires (PNQ), nerve conduction and clinical assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients were assessed, 12.6 Â± 2.8 months after treatment cessation (mean cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> dose, 789 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 40% of patients, neurotoxicity necessitated early cessation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 10% of patients were designated by clinicians with severe neurotoxicity, whilst, in contrast, patient interviews and self-report questionnaires described significant physical limitations due to neuropathic symptoms in 60% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority (85%) of patients had objective evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> with nerve conduction studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reports from clinical interviews were strongly correlated with patient self-assessment (Pearson coefficient = 0.790, p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Given the discrepancies in symptom prevalence highlighted by these findings, the monitoring of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity would benefit from more informative clinical assessment, with inclusion of patient-reported outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such an approach would be beneficial in a clinical trial setting to monitor the efficacy of interventions and in prospective studies of survivorship to determine the true burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
