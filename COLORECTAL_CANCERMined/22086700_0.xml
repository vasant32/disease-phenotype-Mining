<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old man was treated with neoadjuvant bevacizumab followed by liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He made an uneventful recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-three days post-surgery he received bevacizumab and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> life-threatening bile leaks from the cut surface of the liver </plain></SENT>
