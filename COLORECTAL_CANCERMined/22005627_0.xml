<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: African Americans have a lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rate than whites and higher disease incidence and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite wide acceptance of colonoscopy for accurate screening, increasing promotion of high-sensitivity stool test screening, such as the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), may narrow racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study provides formative research data to develop an intervention to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among underinsured and uninsured African Americans in central North Carolina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We held 4 focus groups to explore knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, particularly FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants (n = 28) were African American adults recruited from neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and unemployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Constructs from the diffusion of innovation theory were used to develop the discussion guide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, participants noted that lack of knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> contributes to low screening use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Attitudes about FIT sorted into 4 categories of "innovation characteristics": relative advantage of FIT compared with no screening and with other screening tests; compatibility with personal beliefs and values; test complexity; and test trialability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A perceived barrier to FIT and other stool tests was risk of incurring costs for diagnostic follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Community-based FIT screening interventions should include provider recommendation, patient education to correctly perform FIT, modified FIT design to address negative attitudes about stool tests, and assurance of affordable follow-up for positive FIT results </plain></SENT>
