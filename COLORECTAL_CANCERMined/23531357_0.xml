<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to use SNP-array technology to identify genomic aberrations which could contribute to the increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in HNPCC/LS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals diagnosed with HNPCC/LS (100) and healthy controls (384) were genotyped using the Illumina Human610-Quad SNP-arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Copy number variation (CNV) calling and association analyses were performed using Nexus software, with significant results validated using QuantiSNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TaqMan Copy-Number assays were used for verification of CNVs showing significant association with HNPCC/LS identified by both software programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected copy number <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> gains associated with HNPCC/LS status on chromosome 7q11.21 (28% cases and 0% controls, Nexus; p = 3.60E-20 and QuantiSNP; p &lt; 1.00E-16) and 16p11.2 (46% in cases, while a CN loss was observed in 23% of controls, Nexus; p = 4.93E-21 and QuantiSNP; p = 5.00E-06) via in silico analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TaqMan Copy-Number assay was used for validation of CNVs showing significant association with HNPCC/LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, CNV burden (total CNV length, average CNV length and number of observed CNV events) was significantly greater in cases compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A greater CNV burden was identified in HNPCC/LS cases compared to controls supporting the notion of higher genomic instability in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One intergenic locus on chromosome 7q11.21 is possibly associated with HNPCC/LS and deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results from this study highlight the complexities of fluorescent based CNV analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The inefficiency of both CNV detection methods to reproducibly detect observed CNVs demonstrates the need for sequence data to be considered alongside intensity data to avoid false positive results </plain></SENT>
