<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphisms in pre-miRNA genes may influence the biogenesis and functions of their host miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether these polymorphisms are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the effects of seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in pre-miRNA genes on the prognosis of a Chinese population with 408 CRC patients with surgically-resected <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two SNPs were identified to be significantly associated with recurrence-free survival and overall survival of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most significant SNP was rs6505162 in pre-miR-423 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype, the variant-containing genotypes of this SNP were significantly associated with both the overall survival (HR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.34-3.34, P = 0.001) and the recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.08-2.36, P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another SNP, rs4919510 in pre-miR-608, was also associated with altered recurrence-free survival (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.41-0.92, P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were evident only in patients receiving chemotherapy but not in those without chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the combined analysis of the two SNPs conferred a 2.84-fold (95% CI = 1.50-5.37, P = 0.001) increased risk of recurrence and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, this effect was only prominent in those receiving chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.001) but not in those without chemotherapy (P = 0.999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that genetic polymorphisms in pre-miRNA genes may impact <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis especially in patients receiving chemotherapy, a finding that warrants further independent validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: This is one of the first studies showing a prognostic role of pre-miRNA gene SNPs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
