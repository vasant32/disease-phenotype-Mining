<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>-susceptibility gene RB1 is inactivated in a wide range of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein (Rb) function is often preserved and the RB locus even amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we have previously shown that Rb interacts with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 associated athanogene 1 (BAG-1) protein, which is highly expressed in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show for the first time that Rb expression is critical for BAG-1 anti-apoptotic activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that Rb expression not only increases the nuclear localisation of the anti-apoptotic BAG-1 protein, but that expression of Rb is required for inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by BAG-1 both in a γ-irradiated Saos-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> cell line and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, consistent with the fact that nuclear BAG-1 has previously been shown to promote cell survival through increasing nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity, we demonstrate that the ability of BAG-1 to promote NF-κB activity is significantly inhibited by repression of Rb expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, data presented suggest a novel function for Rb, promoting cell survival through regulating the function of BAG-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As BAG-1 is highly expressed in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e>, targeting the Rb-BAG-1 complex to promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> has exciting potential for future therapeutic development </plain></SENT>
