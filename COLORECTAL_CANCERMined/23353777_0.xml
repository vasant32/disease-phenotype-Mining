<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: GBC is a lethal and multifaceted disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deleted in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) is a well known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently a small genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> to be significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235782,C0153452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gallbladder cancer</z:e> (GBC) susceptibility in a Japanese population sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the study sample size was small and lacked independent replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present study was carried out to replicate the association of two GWAS identified <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> SNPs (A&gt;G C&gt;T and two other SNPs (C&gt;G and A&gt;G) previously associated with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The study was accomplished in 406 GBC cases and 260 healthy control samples from North India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was carried out by PCR-RFLP and Taqman genotyping assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS ver16 and functional prediction of these variants was carried out using Bioinformatics tools (FAST-SNP, F-SNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULT: We did not observe association with GWAS-identified SNPs of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> but other SNPs showed significant association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> haplotype G-A-C-A conferred high risk of GBC in India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The haplotype associated risk was independent of <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp>, sex or tobacco usages which are well-known modifiers of GBC risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further analysis suggested <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> A&gt;G as a major risk conferring SNP in the Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study re-affirms the role of plausible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> variants, in gallbladder <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and the risk haplotype may be explored as a useful marker for GBC susceptibility </plain></SENT>
