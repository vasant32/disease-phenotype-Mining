<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reanalyzed a file of total colonoscopy patients who also prepared three I-FOBTs, processed by the OC-MICRO instrument, using at least 50 ng Hb/ml buffer threshold to determine a positive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The performance of both tests was evaluated by the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry follow-up to identify new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and by determining the effects of the number of tests prepared and their thresholds for analysis, sex, and age on results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1630 patients, mean age 62.7 years, SD 11.9, 50.1% men, having undergone both tests were followed up for a mean of 51.5 months, SD 13.4; 25 CRC patients were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 36 months, I-FOBT sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 95.8% (95% confidence interval 87.8, 104), as was initial colonoscopy; within 48 months, it was 92% (95% confidence interval 81.4, 103) and 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I-FOBT identified 70 of the 122 (57.2%) colonoscopy-detected advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> were more common in men (P&lt;0.01), whose risk increased at 51-73 years (odds ratio 4.639, P=0.056), but not among women (odds ratio 1.952) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It then increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) for both sexes aged at least 74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>I-FOBTs identified most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> diagnosed within 36 months of follow-up with sensitivity similar to that of initial colonoscopy, with neither test identifying every <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
