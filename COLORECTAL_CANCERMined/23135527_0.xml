<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim was to develop a slow-release poly-lactic-co-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17497">glycolic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi>)-5-fluorouracil microsphere, study the pharmacokinetic characteristics as well as to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this preparation on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi>-5-fluorouracil microsphere was prepared based on a spray-drying method, and the drug loading of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (the percentage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> content in the whole microsphere), in vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> release profile and pharmacokinetic characteristics were carried out through high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibiting effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and safety was examined using in vivo subcutaneously (s.c.) inoculated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> models of <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The size of the microsphere was less than 100 Î¼m, drug loading was 20 % and drug release time lasted as long as 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slow-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi>-5-fluorouracil microsphere had longer half-life time (t (1/2)), larger apparent volume of distribution (V ( d )) and smaller area under the curve (AUC) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi>-5-fluorouracil microsphere significantly restrained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and this effect correlated with decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight measurement and blood analysis did not suggest significant adverse effects on the mice during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The slow-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi>-5-fluorouracil microsphere developed here was suitable for regional use; it has pharmacokinetic advantages and appears safe and effective in controlling the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This preparation shows promise in reducing local recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after resection, but needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
