<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multidimensional liquid chromatography‚ÅÑmass spectrometry was used to analyze biological samples labelled with isobaric mass tags for relative and absolute quantitation to identify differentially expressed proteins in human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa for the discovery of cancerous biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cancerous and noncancerous samples were compared using online and offline separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein identification was performed using mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The downregulation of gelsolin protein in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> samples was confirmed by Western blot analysis and validated using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 802 nonredundant proteins were identified in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> samples, 82 of which fell outside the expression range of 0.8 to 1.2, and were considered to be potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed a complete absence of gelsolin expression in 86.89% of samples and a reduction of expression in 13.11% of samples, yielding a sensitivity of 86.89% and a specificity of 100% for distinguishing colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that decreased expression of gelsolin is a potential biomarker of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
