<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the expression of E-cadherin was evaluated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> to determine its correlation with clinico-pathological variables, and association with disease outcome in patients with long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present series consisted of tissue samples obtained from 230 patients with stage I, II, III, or IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated during 1981-1990 at Turku University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Archival paraffin-embedded samples were used to build up tissue microarray blocks, and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using an automated staining system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different grading systems were tested for expression of E-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were positive for E-Cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between E-cadherin expression and gender (p &lt; 0.83), localization (p &lt; 0.45), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion (p &lt; 0.32), or histologic grade (p &lt; 0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, loss of E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with older age (p &lt; 0.03) and lymph node involvement (p &lt; 0.02), and with borderline significance with advanced stage (p &lt; 0.09) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor metastasis</z:e> (p &lt; 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In univariate (Kaplan-Meier) survival analysis, positive E-cadherin significantly (p = 0.009) predicted longer disease-free survival (DFS), and the same was true with disease-specific survival (DSS) as well (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate (Cox) survival analysis, E-cadherin retained its significance as independent predictor of DFS (HR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.01-2.42, p = 0.043), but not DSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A sub-group analysis revealed that E-cadherin expression also predicts DFS (p &lt; 0.01) and DSS (p &lt; 0.04) in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results implicate the usefulness of E-cadherin expression in predicting disease recurrence and long-term survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
