<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While vertical rectus abdominis muscle (V-RAM) flaps can fill the pelvic resection space with health tissue, their use has previously been described predominantly in association with laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a means of combination laparoscopic APR with V-RAM flap reconstruction that allows structural preservation of the entire abdominal wall throughout the oncological resection and of the deep parietal layers after V-RAM donation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a single port access device used at the end colostomy site allows a second senior surgeon assist with an additional two working instruments for the purpose of improved pelvic tissue retraction, especially useful in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
