<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of defective mismatch repair (MMR), as assessed by the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or loss of MMR protein expression by IHC, has been useful for risk assessment, prognosis, and prediction of treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> for the presence of defective MMR from 5927 Colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Family Registry patients recruited at six international consortium sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the appropriate percentage instability cutoff used to distinguish the three MSI phenotypes [ie, stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>), low instability (MSI-L), and high instability (MSI-H)]; the sensitivity, specificity, and performance characteristics of individual markers; and the concordance between MSI and IHC phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Guided by the results of the IHC testing, our findings indicate that the distinction between an MSI-H phenotype from a low-instability or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> phenotype can best be accomplished by using a cutoff of 30% or greater of the markers showing instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> markers were higher than those of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, BAT26 and BAT25 had the highest sensitivity (94%) and specificity (98%), and the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> markers alone identified 97% of the MSI-H cases correctly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, the presence of MSI-H correlated with an older age of diagnosis, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the proximal colon, and female sex </plain></SENT>
