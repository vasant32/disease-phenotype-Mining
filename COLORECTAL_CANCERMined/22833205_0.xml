<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At their large, urban academic medical center with an open-access endoscopy system, the authors previously demonstrated that PN programs produced a colonoscopy completion rate of 78.5% in a cohort of 503 patients (predominantly African Americans and Latinos with public health insurance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very little is known about the direct costs of implementing PN programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to perform a detailed cost analysis of PN programs at the authors' institution from an institutional perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2 randomized controlled trials, average-risk patients who were referred for SC by primary care providers were recruited for PN between May 2008 and May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 PN groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cost of PN and net income to the institution were determined in a cost analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 395 patients who completed colonoscopy, 53.4% underwent SC alone, 30.1% underwent colonoscopy with biopsy, and 16.5% underwent snare polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accounting for the average contribution margins of each procedure type, the total revenue was $95,266.00 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total cost of PN was $14,027.30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Net income was $81,238.70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a model sample of 1000 patients, net incomes for the institutional completion rate (approximately 80%), the historic PN program (approximately 65%), and the national average (approximately 50%) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The current PN program generated additional net incomes of $35,035.50 and $44,956.00, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PN among minority patients with mostly public health insurance generated additional income to the institution, mainly because of increased colonoscopy completion rates </plain></SENT>
