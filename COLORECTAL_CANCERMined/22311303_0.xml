<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few reports exist on long-term survival after minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS) for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No data are available assessing prognostic factors in the era of current modern treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 2002 and December 2008, 274 consecutive patients were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Open liver surgery (OLS) was performed in 193 patients for a total of 437 metastases, and MILS was performed in 81 patients for 176 metastases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic chemotherapy was administered preoperatively in 173 and postoperatively in 174 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impact of 23 potential prognostic factors on disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using univariable and multivariable Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative complications were observed in 54 patients after OLS and in 11 after MILS (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median postoperative length of hospital stay was 9 days after OLS and 5 days after MILS (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the entire patient population, the 5 year DFS and OS rates were 29.9 and 59.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences in survival between patients treated with MILS and OLS were observed (p = 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In univariable analyses, the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and the overall Fong's clinical risk score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) were the only two variables that predicted DFS (p ≤ 0.0035) and OS (p ≤ 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses, the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> was the only independent predictor of both DFS (p = 0.0002) and OS (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The long-term oncologic outcome of surgically treated patients with CRLM is determined by the Fong's <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although MILS does not influence long-term survival, it has a beneficial impact on the immediate postoperative clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
