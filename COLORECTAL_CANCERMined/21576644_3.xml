<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To clarify the prognostic impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nodules without residual lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) structure (ND) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and to determine optimal categorization of ND in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective pathologic review was performed for 1716 patients with stages I to III curatively resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated at 11 institutions between 1994 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional 2242 patients from nine institutions were enrolled between 1999 and 2003 as a second cohort to validate the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (LNM) and ND were observed in 33.7% and 16.0% (smooth-contour nodule [S-ND], 8.2%; irregular-contour nodule [I-ND], 10.7%) of patients in the first cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S-ND and I-ND were similarly distributed in the regional area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no considerable difference in the impact on survival between S-ND (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9 to 3.8) and I-ND (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.3 to 5.8) or between LNM (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 3.4 to 6.0) and ND (HR, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.1 to 5.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LNM and ND were similarly associated with the mode of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> nodules ≥ 5 mm growing with venous/perineural invasion (ND [v/pni+]), judged with 0.61 κ value among 11 observers, had an independent prognostic value for 5-year survival of 42%; similar results were observed in the second cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results do not support the TNM system in which S-ND is treated differently from I-ND in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging; LNM and ND should be considered together in the same category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of ND (v/pni+) has a considerable adverse prognostic effect </plain></SENT>
