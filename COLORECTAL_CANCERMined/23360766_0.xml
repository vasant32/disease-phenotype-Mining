<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both methods revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> levels of endogenous Erk1/2 activities in a highly consistent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon treatment with U0126, an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) acting upstream of Erk1/2, Western-blotting and NMR congruently reported specific modulations of cellular phospho-Erk levels that translated into reduced kinase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results obtained in this study highlight the complementary nature of antibody- and NMR-based phospho-detection techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They further exemplify the usefulness of time-resolved NMR measurements in providing fast and quantitative readouts of kinase activities and kinase inhibitor efficacies in native cellular environments </plain></SENT>
