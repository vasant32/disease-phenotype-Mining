<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate a model for risk stratification for colorectal screening by evaluating the clinical characteristics of synchronous CRN in <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> patients classified according to the presence of MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional, case-control study of 492 patients (368 males and 124 females) with <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp>, and 492 age-matched healthy controls undergoing simultaneous upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> group involved 446 patients without MetS, and 46 patients with MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 177 (39.7%) and 28 (60.9%) synchronous CRN were detected in <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> patients without MetS and with MetS, respectively (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 143 (34.7%) synchronous colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> patients without MetS, whereas 17 (48.6%) were detected in <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> patients with MetS (P=0.101), as well as more synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (11.2% vs 37.9%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> (OR=1.54, 95% CI: 1.18-2.00, P=0.001) and the presence of MetS (odds ratio=1.82, 95% confidence interval: 1.19-2.78, P=0.006) were significant independent risk factors associated with the prevalence of CRN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of synchronous CRN in <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> patients with MetS was 1.96 times greater than that in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> group without MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of synchronous CRN is significantly increased by the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp>, especially in MetS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening for synchronous CRN is highly recommended for <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> patients with MetS </plain></SENT>
