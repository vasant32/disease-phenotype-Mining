<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to investigate the use of quantitative CGI methylation data from stool DNA to classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients and to relate stool CGI methylation levels to those found in corresponding tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied a quantitative methylation-specific PCR assay to determine CGI methylation levels of six genes, previously shown to be aberrantly methylated during colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assays were performed on DNA from biopsies of "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" mucosa and stool samples from 57 patients classified as disease-free, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by endoscopy, and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, CGI methylation was analysed in stool DNA from an asymptomatic population of individuals covering a broad age range (mean = 47 ± 24 years) RESULTS: CGI methylation levels in stool DNA were significantly higher than in DNA from macroscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, and a significant correlation between stool and mucosa was observed for ESR1 only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate statistical analyses using the methylation levels of each CGI in stool DNA as a continuous variable revealed a highly significant (p = 0.003) classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vs. non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> + disease-free) patients (sensitivity = 65 %, specificity = 81 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CGI methylation profiling of stool DNA successfully identified patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> despite the methylation status of CGIs in stool DNA not generally reflecting those in DNA from the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
