<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Under different doses of radiation, colony formation assay and single-hit multi-target model were conducted to draw dose-survival curve and SF2 value of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines(RKO, Lovo) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-throughput lncRNA/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> chips were used to screen lncRNA genes and protein coding genes with expression differences more than 2 folds between RKO, Lovo cell lines and RKO cell line receiving 2Gy radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main action pathway was computed by Gene Ontology analysis combined with Pathway analysis in order to explore the mechanism which induces the effect of lncRNA on radiosensitivity of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further experiment on P53, P21, cyclin D1 expression contents of RKO cell line was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lovo(SF2=0.47) was more sensitiv to radiation than RKO(SF2=0.53) according to the outcome of colony formation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-throughput lncRNA/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> chips identified a total of 268 lncRNA genes and 270 protein coding genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene Ontology analysis showed that the expression of genes associated with cell cycle process were significantly different (38.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant relationship between expression of several lncRNAs and CCND1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR showed no significant differences of P53 and P21 expression in RKO and Lovo cell lines(P&gt;0.05), while cyclin D1 expression of RKO cell line was higher than that of Lovo cell lines(P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After exposed to 2 Gy doses of radiation, there was an obvious decrease of cyclin D1 expression in RKO cell lines(P&lt;0.05), while P53 and P21 expressions were not different(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The possible mechanism is that lncRNAs compose transcription compound to combine with CCND1 gene and influence radiosensitivity of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines by regulating expression of cyclin D1, which is independent of P53-P21-cyclin D1 pathway </plain></SENT>
