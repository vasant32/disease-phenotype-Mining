<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-fat diets that lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may be a contributing factor, but the mechanisms are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study examines susceptibility to azoxymethane (AOM)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> in mice in response to consumption of either a low or a high-fat diet and associated molecular changes in the liver and colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene markers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> metabolism, leptin-regulated inflammatory cytokines and proliferation were assessed in liver and colon in response to high-fat feeding to determine links with increased sensitivity to AOM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-fat feeding increased development of AOM-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> and was associated with increased CYP2E1 gene expression in the liver, but not the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leptin receptors and the colon stem cell marker (Lgr5) were down-regulated in the proximal colon, with a corresponding up-regulation of the inflammatory cytokine (IL6) in response to high-fat feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably in the distal colon, where <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> develop in response to AOM, the proliferative stem cell marker, Lgr5, was significantly up-regulated with high-fat feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides evidence that high-fat diets can alter regulation of molecular markers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> metabolism that may expose the colon to carcinogens, in parallel with activation of Î²-catenin-regulated targets regulating colon epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-fat diets associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may alter multiple molecular factors that act synergistically to increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
