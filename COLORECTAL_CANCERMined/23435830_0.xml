<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the predictive value of PIK3CA mutations for survival remains inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we pooled the data from published studies to estimate the association between PIK3CA mutation and survival outcomes in mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies investigating the association of PIK3CA mutations with clinical survival outcomes of mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR mAbs were systematically identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall hazard ratio (HR) was estimated by using fixed effect model or random effect model according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between trails </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight studies that reported survival outcome in 839 mCRC patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In unselected patients, we found that PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with poorer PFS [8 studies, 839 patients; HR = 1.53; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.28-1.84; P &lt; 0.001] and OS (5 studies; 587 patients; HR = 1.28; 95 % CI 1.05-1.56; P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With increased predictive power in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients (3 studies; 275 patients), the overall HR for PFS was 2.44 (95 % CI 1.33-4.48; P = 0.004) and was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed a worse OS in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients with PIK3CA mutations (2 studies; 163 patients; HR = 1.37; 95 % CI 0.80-2.35; P = 0.258), although the result was not statistically significant due to small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PIK3CA mutation is a promising predictive biomarker for poor survival in mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR mAbs, particularly in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
