<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amount of visceral fat assessed by micro-computed tomography was almost 15 times higher than that of same aged C57BL/6J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with azoxymethane (AOM; 200 μg/mouse injected once a week for 3 times) resulted in markedly increased colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) development (≈70 ACF/mouse) in KK-A(y) mice compared with lean C57BL/6J mice (≈9 ACF/mouse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, administration of AOM at a dose of 200 μg/mouse once a week for 6 times developed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> within only 7 weeks after the last AOM injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was 88% in KK-A(y) mice and was markedly higher than the 4% observed in C57BL/6J mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were observed in most of the AOM-treated KK-A(y) mice along with remarkable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and some showed submucosal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the KK-A(y) mouse, featuring intact leptin and leptin receptor Ob-Rbl, could be a useful animal model to investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
