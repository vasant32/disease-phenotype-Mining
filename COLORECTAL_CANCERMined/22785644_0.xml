<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that early or multiple administrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> challenge had a strong impact on survival with or without LMD </plain></SENT>
