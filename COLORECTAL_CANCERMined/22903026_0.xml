<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a highly sensitive technique for resolving thermally-induced protein folding/unfolding transitions, recently was recognized as a novel tool for disease diagnosis and monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further elaborate this approach we have applied DSC in a study of blood plasma from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) at different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood plasma from patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was analyzed by DSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> thermograms were compared to those of healthy individuals and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> and non-cancerous soft tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The thermodynamic parameters: excess heat capacity and enthalpy of the transitions corresponding to the most abundant plasma proteins, as well as transition and first moment temperatures were determined from the calorimetric profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The calorimetric profiles of blood plasma from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients are found to be distinct from those of healthy individuals and those of patients with soft tissue, non-cancerous <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Generally the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> thermograms exhibit reduced heat capacity of the major albumin/globulin-assigned thermal transitions, lower enthalpy and a featureless high temperature region compared to healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A classification of blood plasma proteome from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (CRC1, CRC2 and CRC3 groups, and subgroups within each group CRC1(1-2), CRC2(1-2) and CRC3(1-2)) is proposed based on the derived thermodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The presented data demonstrate a proof of principle and confirm that the DSC technique has a potential to monitor changes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> blood plasma proteome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study is a further step toward the validation of calorimetry as a diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
