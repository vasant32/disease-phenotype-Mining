<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: to determine accuracy of endoscopic localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in comparison with preoperative computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyse variables that could be associated with a wrong endoscopic localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: endoscopic and CT localization of a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> without previous surgery were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the concordance between endoscopic and radiologic localization against operative findings comparing accuracy of endoscopy and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analysed the frequency of wrong endoscopic diagnoses with regard to a series of patient, endoscopy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: two hundred thirty seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 223 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concordance with surgical localization was: colonoscopy = 0.87 and CT = 0.69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic localization accuracy was:91.1%; CT: 76.2%: p = 0.00001; OR = 3.22 (1.82-5.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> presented a higher rate of wrong localization: 18 vs. 5.7% in non-obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (p = 0.0034; OR = 3.65 (1.35-9.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic localization mistakes varied depending on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, being more frequent in descending colon: 36.3%, p = 0.014; OR = 6.23 (1.38-26.87) and cecum: 23.1%, p = 0.007; OR = 3.92 (1.20-12.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: endoscopic accuracy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> localization was very high and significantly better than CT accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and those located in the descending colon or cecum wereassociated with a significant increase of the error risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> endoscopic localization </plain></SENT>
