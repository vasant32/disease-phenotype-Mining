<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> through colorectal endoscopy is important and widely used in hospitals as a standard medical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During colonoscopy, the lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> on the colon surface are visually inspected by a Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) zoom-videoendoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using the visual appearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> in endoscopic images, histological diagnosis is presumed based on classification schemes for NBI magnification findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report on the performance of a recognition system for classifying NBI images of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> into three types (A, B, and C3) based on the NBI magnification findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To deal with the problem of computer-aided classification of NBI images, we explore a local feature-based recognition method, bag-of-visual-words (BoW), and provide extensive experiments on a variety of technical aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed prototype system, used in the experiments, consists of a bag-of-visual-words representation of local features followed by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A number of local features are extracted by using sampling schemes such as Difference-of-Gaussians and grid sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, in this paper we propose a new combination of local features and sampling schemes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extensive experiments with varying the parameters for each component are carried out, for the performance of the system is usually affected by those parameters, e.g. the sampling strategy for the local features, the representation of the local feature histograms, the kernel types of the SVM classifiers, the number of classes to be considered, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recognition results are compared in terms of recognition rates, precision/recall, and F-measure for different numbers of visual words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proposed system achieves a recognition rate of 96% for 10-fold cross validation on a real dataset of 908 NBI images collected during actual colonoscopy, and 93% for a separate test dataset </plain></SENT>
