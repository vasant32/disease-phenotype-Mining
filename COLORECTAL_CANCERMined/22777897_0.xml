<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> glial (Müller) cells are involved in a wide range of developmental mechanisms, including axon guidance and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to explore whether Netrin-4, an axonal guidance molecule, is expressed by Müller cells and promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Netrin-4 was found through <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers, and its expression was demonstrated in Müller cells, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium cells and bovine <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> endothelial cells (BRECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Co-localization of Netrin-4 with Müller cell-specific molecules [cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17898">retinaldehyde</z:chebi>-binding protein (cRALBP), vimentin] was observed in the ganglion cell layer, nerve fiber layer, and at the outer limiting membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under hypoxic conditions, the release of Netrin-4 from Müller cells was increased, with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels upregulated in a <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1-dependent manner and dependent on the concomitantly induced release of vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings were consistent with an intensified immunofluorescence of Netrin-4 labeling in the postischemic retinas after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Netrin-4 stimulated BRECs to increase phosphorylation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP) kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/-2, and p38, in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Synthetic inhibitors of the MAP kinases were able to suppress Netrin-4-induced migration and proliferation of BRECs suggesting that both MAP kinases are differentially involved in Netrin-4-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two receptors for Netrins, i.e., deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) and uncoordinated-5-homolog 1 (Unc5H1), were detected in BRECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> is at least partially required for Netrin-4-induced activation of ERK-1/-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that Müller glial cells contribute to, and may modulate, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> Netrin-4 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may be a novel pathway of Müller cell-mediated control of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, particularly under hypoxic/ischemic conditions when the cells upregulate Netrin-4 expression </plain></SENT>
