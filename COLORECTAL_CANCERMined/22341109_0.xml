<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> or other byproducts of production pressure may negatively influence the quality of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the practices and perceptions of U.S. endoscopists regarding the effect of production pressure on the performance of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We conducted a 40-question online survey to assess endoscopists' practices and perceptions concerning production pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A total of 5030 U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The proportion of endoscopists responding positively to questions pertaining to the impact of production pressure on colonoscopy practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of respondents indicated that production pressure influenced one or more aspects of their endoscopic practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examples of production pressure included (1) postponing polypectomy for a subsequent session (2.8%), (2) reducing the length of time spent inspecting the colon (7.2%), and (3) proceeding with colonoscopy in a patient with an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio (69.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight percent of respondents reported witnessing the effects of production pressure on a colleague </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Respondents working fee-for-service and those with &gt;10 years since completion of fellowship were more likely to describe their weekly workloads as excessive compared with those who were salaried (81.3% vs 71.3%; P = .01) and &lt;10 years out of training (81% vs 72.7%; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Nonresponse bias due to low response rate (22.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Production pressure influences the conduct of colonoscopy for many endoscopists and could have an adverse effect on the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(Clinical trial registration number: RE:GIE D 11-01288R1.) The study was an Internet study and did not involve human subjects </plain></SENT>
