<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) as a potential surrogate endpoint (SEP) for overall survival (OS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) with a focus on applicability to trials containing targeted therapy with anti-VEGF- or anti-EGF receptor (EGFR)-directed monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A systematic literature search of randomized trials of first-line chemotherapy for mCRC reported from January 2000 to January 2012 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adjusted weighted linear regression was used to calculate correlations within PFS and OS (endpoints; R(EP)) and between treatment effects on PFS and on OS (treatment effects; R(TE)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty trials reflecting 22,736 patients met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation between treatment effects on PFS and OS and between the endpoints PFS and OS was high across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies (R(TE) = 0.87, R(EP) = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was also observed in chemotherapy-only trials (R(TE) = 0.93, R(EP) = 0.81) but less so for trials containing monoclonal antibodies (R(TE) = 0.47; R(EP) = 0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limiting the analysis to bevacizumab-based studies (11 trials, 3,310 patients) again yielded high correlations between treatment effects on PFS and on OS (R(TE) = 0.84), whereas correlation within PFS and OS was low (R(EP) = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7 trials (1,335 patients) investigating cetuximab- or panitumumab-based studies, contrasting correlations with very wide confidence intervals were observed (R(TE) = 0.28; R(EP) = 0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PFS showed consistently high correlation with OS of an order that would justify its use as an SEP in chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For validation of surrogacy in anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR-directed therapies, further research and a larger set of trials is needed </plain></SENT>
