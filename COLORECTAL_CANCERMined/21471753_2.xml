<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify independent predictors of postoperative mortality and morbidity as well as independent predictors of long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study was planned as a retrospective single-institution review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study took place at the Department of Surgery, The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Australia, between 1984 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Prospectively collected data were extracted from the records of 1867 patients undergoing treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcomes for 379 patients undergoing surgical resection of their primary colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumor</z:e> in the presence of unresectable synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Independent predictive factors for postoperative mortality and morbidity as well as long-term survival were assessed by use of logistic regression and Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five (9.2%) patients died in the postoperative period and morbidity was 48.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day postoperative mortality was independently associated with medical complications (P &lt; .001), emergency operations (P = .001), female sex (P = .002), and age (≥ 70; P = .007) on regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elderly (≥ 70) patients with either advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> or extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were at a particularly high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative predictors of surgical morbidity included male sex (P = .028) and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> (P = .036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Preoperative predictors of medical complications included repeat operations (P &lt; .001), elevated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> levels (P = .017), and emergency operations (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Independent factors associated with poor overall survival included medical complications (P &lt; .001), nodal stage (N2) (P = .004), poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation (P = .006), and apical lymph node involvement (P = .042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of patients with advanced nodal disease (N2) and a poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation had a significantly poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> or extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> are at high risk of 30-day postoperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Significant nodal disease and poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation are important predictors of long-term survival </plain></SENT>
