<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) are used for colorectal obstruction preoperatively and palliatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited data on the use of stents for obstruction caused by extracolonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> exist, and the results are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SEMS for patients stented as a bridge to surgery and as palliation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or extracolonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1998 and 2009, a total of 101 patients underwent 108 stenting procedures for malignant colorectal obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the study cohort, 11 patients were stented as a bridge to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For palliatively stented patients, the etiology of obstruction was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 66 patients and extracolonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall technical success was 99% and clinical success 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred for 20 (20%) patients in 22 of 108 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (n = 6), recurrent obstruction (n = 8), and stent migration (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A median time to complication was 81.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall stent placement-related mortality was 2/101 (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients stented as a bridge to surgery, a primary anastomosis in elective operations was achieved for 90% (9/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the palliation groups, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> had significantly higher clinical success rates than patients with extracolonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (94% vs. 65%, P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in complications, operation, and stoma rates between the palliation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SEMS is a safe and effective treatment for patients stented as a bridge to surgery or as palliation due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Stents are also useful in relieving obstruction due to extracolonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, but the clinical failure rate is higher than for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
