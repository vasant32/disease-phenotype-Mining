<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Chemosensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues to 5-FU, irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was assessed by HDRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> proteins was quantified by image analysis in 76 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inhibition rates (IRs) of the anticancer drugs by HDRA were not related to <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the IR of 5-FU was significantly decreased with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p=0.03) and advanced clinical stages (p=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IRs of irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> were not associated with clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, positive scores for MRP2 and BCRP protein were paradoxically related to lower clinical stages (p=0.043) and male gender (p=0.019), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical staining of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> proteins can not predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses to anticancer drugs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chemoresistance to 5-FU as indicated by HDRA was highly associated with aggressive prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
