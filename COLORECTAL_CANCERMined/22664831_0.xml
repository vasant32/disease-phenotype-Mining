<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine prognostic factors in patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> who were not surgical candidates and received liver radiofrequency (RF) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: RF ablation was done for 141 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in 84 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 63 (75.0 %, 63/84) males and 21 (25.0 %, 21/84) females, with a mean age of 64.6 ± 10.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean maximum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter was 2.3 ± 1.4 cm (range 0.5-9.0 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were associated at the time of liver RF ablation in 23 patients (27.4 %, 23/84), and 12 (14.3 %, 12/84) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> considered controllable by planned lung RF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no procedure-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 90.6 % (95 %CI, 83.9-97.2 %), 44.9 % (95 %CI, 31.8-57.9 %), and 20.8 % (95 %CI, 7.3-34.3 %), respectively, with a median survival of 34.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The univariate analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter larger than 3 cm, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> multiplicity, uncontrollable extrahepatic disease, and previous chemotherapy history were significantly worse prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The former three factors remained significant for worse prognosis in the multivariate Cox model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extrahepatic disease was not a prognostic factor when it could be controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size and number, and uncontrollable extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were significant prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
