<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 98 patients pathologically diagnosed as advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were treated with FOLFOX chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TheDNA of peripheral blood-leukocytes was obtained before treatment, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> genetype was detected by PCR-RFLP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of XPD751 Lys/lys was 76 cases (77.6%), lys/Gln 17 cases (17.4%), and Gln/Gln genetype 5 cases (5.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effective rate of FOLFOX chemotherapy among patients with XPD751 Lys/lys was 50.0%, lys/Gln 29.4%, and Gln/Gln genetypes 20.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference between Lys/lys and lys/Gln was statistically significant, Ï‡(2) = 4.04, P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the failure of chemotherapy in patients with Lys/Lys genetype was 3.8-fold to those with Lys/Gln, by adjusting of gender, age, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor metastasis</z:e> (OR = 3.800) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MTTP of the 98 patients was 10.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MTTP was 11.3 months for patients with Lys/Lys genotypes of XPD751 gene and 2.9 months for patients with Lys/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes of XPD751 gene, the difference between Lys/Lys and at least one Gln was significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Single nucleotide polymorphism of XPD751 correlates with the clinical response to FOLFOX chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>XPD751 genetic polymorphisms may be associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> of advanced colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> as the first line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>XPD751 genotype detected by the PCR-RFLP method may be a predictor of prognosis for FOLFOX chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
