<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: The present study was initiated to examine the claims of the residents of the Druze Isifya Village in Northern Israel that their high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rates were associated with the past exposures to radiation from radio and cellular transmitters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective: To investigate the association between past exposure to RF/MW transmitters and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risks, taking into account <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial cancer</z:e> history, occupational exposures and indicators of life-style </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: We carried out a population-based case-control study involving 307 residents, of whom 47 were diagnosed between 1989 and 2007 with different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and 260 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> diagnoses were obtained from medical the records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure status of individual houses were determined from a map, based on the distances between each house and RF/MW antennas, and were calculated using geographic information systems (GIS) tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on additional risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, like smoking and occupation, were obtained from individual questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis was adjusted for measures of life style and occupational exposure, and Binary multiple logistic regressions was used, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites and for individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types for those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with at least 5 documented cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: Past occupational exposures to chemicals (e.g., pesticides) and electronics, were found to be strongly associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risks (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites: OR=2.79; CI=1.14-6.82; P&lt;0.05), but no discernible trend in overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk was associated with proximity to sources of past RF/MW radiation exposure (n=47 OR=1.00; CI=0.99-1.02; P&gt;0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> showed a negligible elevated adjusted risk associated with radiation intensity (n=11 OR=1.03; CI=1.01-1.05; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: There was evidence for an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> which were associated with chemicals in manufacturing and agriculture and electronics, where there may have been exposures to EMF, but the study did not confirm the suspicion of increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risks associated with radiation for most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types in this village </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Misclassification of past exposures could explain the negative finding </plain></SENT>
