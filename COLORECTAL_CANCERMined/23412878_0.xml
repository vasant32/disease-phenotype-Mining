<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Background: Chemotherapies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> commonly include <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With standard doses of 5-FU, substantial inter-patient variability has been observed in exposure levels and treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, improved outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients due to pharmacokinetically guided 5-FU dosing were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed at establishing a rapid and sensitive method for monitoring 5-FU plasma levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients in our routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods: Performance of the Saladax My5-FU™ immunoassay was evaluated on the Roche Cobas® Integra 800 analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 5-FU concentrations of 247 clinical plasma samples obtained with this assay were compared to the results obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and other commonly used clinical analyzers (Olympus AU400, Roche Cobas c6000, and Thermo Fisher CDx90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: The My-FU assay was successfully validated on the Cobas Integra 800 analyzer in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery, interference, sample carryover, and dilution integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Method comparison between the Cobas Integra 800 and LC-MS/MS revealed a proportional bias of 7% towards higher values measured with the My5-FU assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, when the Cobas Integra 800 was compared to three other clinical analyzers in addition to LC-MS/MS including 50 samples representing the typical clinical range of 5-FU plasma concentrations, only a small proportional bias (≤1.6%) and a constant bias below the limit of detection was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The My5-FU assay demonstrated robust and highly comparable performance on different analyzers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the assay is suitable for monitoring 5-FU plasma levels in routine clinical practice and may contribute to improved efficacy and safety of commonly used 5-FU-based chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
