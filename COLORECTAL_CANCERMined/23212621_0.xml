<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An effective screening tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is a new frontier in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> involves several metabolic changes leading to the production of specific compounds that can be detected in exhaled breath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have a specific VOC pattern compared with the healthy population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Exhaled breath was collected in an inert bag (Tedlar(®) ) from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and healthy controls (negative at colonoscopy), and processed offline by thermal-desorber gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to evaluate the VOC profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the trial phase VOCs of interest were identified and selected, and VOC patterns able to discriminate patients from controls were set up; in the validation phase their discriminant performance was tested on blinded samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A probabilistic neural network (PNN) validated by the leave-one-out method was used to identify the pattern of VOCs that better discriminated between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some 37 patients and 41 controls were included in the trial phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Application of a PNN to a pattern of 15 compounds showed a discriminant performance with a sensitivity of 86 per cent, a specificity of 83 per cent and an accuracy of 85 per cent (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 0·852) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of PNN analysis was confirmed in the validation phase on a further 25 subjects; the model correctly assigned 19 patients, giving an overall accuracy of 76 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pattern of VOCs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was different from that in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PNN in this study was able to discriminate patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with an accuracy of over 75 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Breath VOC analysis appears to have potential clinical application in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, although further studies are required to confirm its reliability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> clinical settings </plain></SENT>
