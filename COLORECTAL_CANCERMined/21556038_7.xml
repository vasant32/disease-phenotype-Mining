<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Some studies have suggested that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (UDCA) may have a chemopreventive effect on the development of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of high-dose (28-30 mg/kg/day) UDCA on the development of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with UC and PSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with UC and PSC enrolled in a prior, multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of high-dose UDCA were evaluated for the development of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with UC and PSC who received UDCA were compared with those who received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the pathology and colonoscopy reports for the development of low-grade or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-six subjects were followed for a total of 235 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics (including duration of PSC and UC, medications, patient age, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and smoking status) were similar for both the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who received high-dose UDCA had a significantly higher risk of developing colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) during the study compared with those who received placebo (hazard ratio: 4.44, 95% confidence interval: 1.30-20.10, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of high-dose UDCA is associated with an increased risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with UC and PSC </plain></SENT>
