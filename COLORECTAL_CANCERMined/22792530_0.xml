<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Identification of subgroups of patients who differ in their response to treatment could help to establish which of the best available chemotherapeutic options are best, based on biological activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), novel molecular-targeted agents that act on pathways that regulate cell growth, the cell cycle, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and invasion are being developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we employed an in vitro chemosensitivity assay to evaluate the biological efficacy of conventional monotherapies and combination chemotherapy with targeted drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The chemosensitivities of 12 CRC cell lines to the established regimens FOLFOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> [5-FU] + leucovorin + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) and FOLFIRI (5-FU + leucovorin + irinotecan) and to therapy with these regimens in combination with the biologically targeted drugs bevacizumab or cetuximab were comparatively evaluated for their effects on apoptotic and autophagic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> processes, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each of the chemotherapeutic regimens promoted apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> drug regimens caused significantly greater apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with activation of caspase-3 in SW480 cells compared to other cells, effects that were associated with a remarkable reduction in matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FOLFOX regimen more effectively promoted apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and invasion than the FOLFIRI regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy with FOLFOX/FOLFIRI regimen and bevacizumab produced a moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-blocking effect in most cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results validate our in vitro chemosensitivity assay, and suggest that it may be applied to help determine adequate regimens in individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients based on the biological characteristics of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
