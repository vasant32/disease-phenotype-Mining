<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response to short-term cediranib treatment was studied using dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI at 7 T, as well as (18) F-fluoromisonidazole <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and histological markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats bearing subcutaneous HT29 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> were imaged at baseline; they then received three doses of cediranib (3 mg/kg per dose daily) or vehicle (dosed daily), with follow-up imaging performed 2 h after the final cediranib or vehicle dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were excised and evaluated for the perfusion marker Hoechst 33342, the endothelial cell marker CD31, smooth muscle actin, intercapillary distance and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis showed that the number of CD31-positive vessels (59 per mm(2) ), the fraction of smooth muscle actin-positive vessels (80-87%) and the intercapillary distance (0.17 mm) were similar in cediranib- and vehicle-treated groups </plain></SENT>
