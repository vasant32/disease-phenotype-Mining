<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first aim of this study was to analyse the prognostic effects on overall survival of disease progression, and of toxicities under first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied the benefit of introducing irinotecan in each arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, we compared the effect of treatment on repeated progression and toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we used Cox regression models with time-dependent variables and shared gamma frailty regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that early on during follow-up, the prognostic effect on survival of progression under first-line therapy was greater in C (hazard ratio [HR]=18.0 [7.9-41.2]) than in S (HR=7.7 [3.9-17.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference was significant, but it decreased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognostic effect of severe toxicities was greater in S (HR=2.0 [1.4-2.9]) than in C (HR=1.3 [0.9-1.9]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Introducing irinotecan was significantly more beneficial in S (HR=0.2 [0.1-0.4]) than in C (HR=0.3 [0.2-1.5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of repeated progression was not significantly different between the two groups (HR=0.9 [0.8-1.1]) whereas the risk of toxicities was greater in C (HR=1.7 [1.4-2.1]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, this study suggests that starting with less toxic first-line treatment is a valid option since it does not exert a deleterious effect on the risk of overall progression or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
