<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Post-polypectomy surveillance has become a major indication for colonoscopy as a result of increased use of screening colonoscopy in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, because the medical resource is limited, and the first screening colonoscopy produces the greatest effect on reducing the incidence and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, there is a need to increase the efficiency of postpolypectomy surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present report, a careful analytic approach was used to address <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available evidences to delineate the predictors for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> at surveillance colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of review of the evidences, we elucidated the high risk findings of the index colonoscopy as follows: 1) 3 or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, 2) any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> larger than 10 mm, 3) any tubulovillous or villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, 4) any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 5) any serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> larger than 10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients without any high-risk findings at the index colonoscopy, surveillance colonoscopy should be performed five years after index colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with one or more high risk findings, surveillance colonoscopy should be performed three years after polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the surveillance interval can be shortened considering the quality of the index colonoscopy, the completeness of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removal, the patient's general condition, and family and medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This practical guideline cannot totally take the place of clinical judgments made by practitioners and should be revised and supplemented in the future as new evidence becomes available </plain></SENT>
