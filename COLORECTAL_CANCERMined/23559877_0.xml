<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody, directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, that was shown to be effective in third-line <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with chemo-refractory non-KRAS-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, who received panitumumab at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Canada, between 2009 and 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This chart review included 44 patients (median age: 60 years; performance status: 0-3), of whom 50% had already received three lines of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (pfs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were overall survival and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour progression</z:e> was determined by radiologic assessments performed once every 3 months per clinical guidelines or by clinical deterioration as determined by the clinician-investigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our sample, median pfs was 21.86 ± 5.23 weeks (95% confidence interval: 12.9 to 36.9 weeks) and overall survival was 35.14 ± 7.75 weeks (95% confidence interval: 25.6 to 73.4 weeks) with a median of 5 cycles of panitumumab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported toxicities with panitumumab were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> (16.2% grade 3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> (10.8% grade 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No infusion reactions were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite a small sample size from a single institution, our survival and efficacy data are encouraging and comparable to results obtained from the registration panitumumab trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that panitumumab can be effective and tolerable in a real-world setting </plain></SENT>
