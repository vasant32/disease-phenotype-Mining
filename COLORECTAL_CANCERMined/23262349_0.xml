<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in specific loci or genes have been identified associated with susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in different ethnicities and regions, the genetic variations and the environmental factors can widely vary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, here we propose a post-GWAS analysis method to investigate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility SNPs in Taiwan by conducting a replication analysis and bioinformatics analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-four significant SNPs from published GWAS results were collected by a literature survey, and two hundred and eighteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples and 385 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples were collected for post-GWAS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, twenty-six significant SNPs were identified and reported as associated with susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> in a previous GWAS study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis results of 26 SNPs indicate that most biological processes identified are involved in regulating immune responses and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, an efficient prediction model was constructed by applying Jackknife feature selection and ANOVA testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As compared to another risk prediction model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for European Caucasians population, which performs 0.616 of AUC by using 54 SNPs, the proposed model shows good performance in predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk within the Taiwanese population, i.e., 0.724 AUC by using 16 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe that the proposed risk prediction model is highly promising for predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk within the Taiwanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the functional analysis results could be helpful to explore the potential associated regulatory mechanisms that may be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
