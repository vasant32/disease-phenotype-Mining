<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One in 4 patients with lymph node-negative, invasive colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) develops <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> after undergoing curative surgery, and most die of advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Predicting which patients will develop a recurrence is a significantly growing, unmet medical need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues obtained at surgery were retrieved from 74 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (15 with stage I disease and 59 with stage II disease) for Training/Test Sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, FFPE tissues were retrieved from 49 patients with stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 215 patients with stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> for an External Validation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e>) Set (n = 264) from 18 hospitals in 4 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patients had received neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proprietary genetic programming analysis of expression profiles for 225 prespecified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> genes was used to create a 36-month recurrence risk signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, a 5-gene rule correctly classified 62 of 92 recurrent patients and 87 of 172 nonrecurrent patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> Set (sensitivity, 0.67; specificity, 0.51). "High-risk" patients had a greater probability of 36-month recurrence (42%) than "low-risk" patients (26%; hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.71; P = .007; Cox regression) independent of T-classification, the number of lymph nodes examined, histologic grade/subtype, anatomic location, age, sex, or race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rule outperformed (P = .021) current National Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Network Guidelines (hazard ratio, 0.897) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same rule also differentiated the risk of recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.63; P = .031) in a subset of patients from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> Set who had stage I/II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> only (n = 251) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the 5-gene rule (OncoDefender-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is the first molecular prognostic that has been validated in both stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It outperforms standard clinicopathologic prognostic criteria and obviates the need to retrieve â‰¥12 lymph nodes for accurate prognostication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It identifies those patients most likely to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> within 3 years after curative surgery and, thus, those most likely to benefit from adjuvant treatment </plain></SENT>
