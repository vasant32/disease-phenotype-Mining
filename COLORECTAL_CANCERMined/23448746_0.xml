<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A longitudinal, randomized, controlled trial design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An urban medical center in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE: 60 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who had undergone abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the ST-36 acupressure group (n = 30) and a sham acupressure group (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the ST-36 group received an acupressure procedure in a three-minute cycle performed three times per day during the five days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the control group received routine postoperative care and sham acupressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to gauge longitudinal effects of the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Frequency of bowel sounds, the time to first flatus passage, first liquid intake, solid intake, and defecation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Patients who received acupressure had significantly earlier flatus passage and time to liquid intake as compared to patients in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other main variables, including the first time to solid intake and defecation, did not show significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The GEE method revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had increasing bowel sounds over time, and the experimental group had greater improvement of bowel motility than the control group within the period of 2-3 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ST-36 acupressure was able to shorten the time to first flatus passage, oral liquid intake, and improve gastrointestinal function in patients after abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: ST-36 acupressure can be integrated into postoperative adjunct nursing care to assist patients' postoperative gastrointestinal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION: Few studies have explored the effectiveness of acupressure techniques on promoting bowel sounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Evidence from this study suggests stimulation of the ST-36 acupressure point can increase bowel sound frequency for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the first three days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Application of this technique may improve a patient's comfort after surgery </plain></SENT>
