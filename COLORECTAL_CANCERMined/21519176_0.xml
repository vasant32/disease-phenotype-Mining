<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings, as well as the follow-up data, to evaluate the effectiveness and the long-term results of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for ECC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed, retrospectively, 94 lesions in 92 patients who underwent EMR for ECC from January 2002 to June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overage age of patients was 60 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 22.1 months (6-80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>En bloc resection rate was 64.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Submucosal invasion was found in 30 cases (31.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>De novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rate was 26.6% which had higher submucosal invasion rate (60%, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complete resection rate was 87.2%, and there was no recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during follow-up (p=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve incomplete resection cases had received further surgical treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No procedure-related mortality was found and no recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was found except 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that EMR is an effective and safe treatment for ECC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>En bloc resection provides precise histologic information and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
