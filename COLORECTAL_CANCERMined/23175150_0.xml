<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also explored the role of excision repair cross complementing group-1 (ERCC-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety anti-epidermal growth factor receptor-naive advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients KRAS mutational status was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 60 patients <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> ERCC-1 expression was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS) after FOLFOX-6±bevacizumab were evaluated according to KRAS status and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> ERCC-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 90 patients 47% <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) and 53% mutated (mt) KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rate was 26% in the wt KRAS group, whereas it was 56% in the mt KRAS group; the difference is statistically significant in the total sample (P=0.008) and when only patients receiving FOLFOX-6±bevacizumab as first-line are considered (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival was longer in mt than in wt KRAS patients over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (10 vs 8 months, respectively, P=0.001) and in those treated as first-line (10 vs 8 months, respectively, P=0.0069) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mt KRAS patients experienced a longer survival (24 vs 18 months; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ERCC-1 mRNA expression was not found to correlate with FOLFOX activity in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that activating mutation of KRAS oncogene may predict response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Basal expression of ERCC-1 mRNA does not explain the high efficacy of FOLFOX-6 in mt KRAS patients </plain></SENT>
