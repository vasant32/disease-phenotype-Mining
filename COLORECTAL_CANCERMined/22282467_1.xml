<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between FDG accumulation and KRAS/BRAF mutations has not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether KRAS/BRAF mutations affect FDG accumulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Retrospective analysis was conducted in 51 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent FDG-PET/computed tomographic (CT) scans for staging before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-to-liver ratio (TLR) were calculated from FDG accumulation and compared between KRAS/BRAF mutated and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter-1 (GLUT1) and hexokinase type-II (HXK-II) were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both SUV(max) and TLR were significantly higher in the KRAS/BRAF-mutated group compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> group (P = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that SUV(max) and TLR remained significantly associated with KRAS/BRAF mutations (P = 0.016 and 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS/BRAF status could be predicted with an accuracy of 75% when a SUV(max) cutoff value of 13 or 14 was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GLUT1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells was positively correlated with FDG accumulation and KRAS/BRAF status whereas HXK-II expression was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FDG accumulation was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with KRAS/BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET/CT scans may be useful for predicting the KRAS/BRAF status of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and thus aid in determination of therapeutic strategies for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
