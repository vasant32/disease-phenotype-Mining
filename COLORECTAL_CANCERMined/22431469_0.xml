<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to detect AEG-1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, 8 pairs of fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and adjacent nontumor tissues (ANT), 120 pairs of paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens and ANT tissues, and 60 samples of lymph node metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scratch wound assay and transwell matrix penetration assay were performed to determine migration and invasion of SW480 cell lines with stable AEG-1 overexpression or SW620 cell lines with AEG-1 knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AEG-1 expression was upregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines and tissues compared with ANT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AEG-1 expression level significantly correlated with UICC stage, and the N classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AEG-1 overexpression significantly enhanced migration and invasion of SW480 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, AEG-1 knockdown suppressed migration and invasion of SW620 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, there was a positive correlation between AEG-1 high expression and β-catenin nuclear expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AEG-1 overexpression increased nuclear β-catenin accumulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AEG-1 knockdown decreased nuclear β-catenin accumulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we firstly found that AEG-1 interacted with β-catenin in SW480 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results for the first time showed that AEG-1 interacted with β-catenin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and AEG-1 expression was closely associated with progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AEG-1 might be a potential therapeutic target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
