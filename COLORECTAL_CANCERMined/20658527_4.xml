<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test the feasibility of FIT as compared to guaiac fecal occult blood test (G-FOBT) in a large urban population of Tel Aviv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Average-risk persons, aged 50-75 years, were offered FIT or G-FOBT after randomization according to the socioeconomic status of their clinics </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemoccult SENSA™ and OC-MICRO™ (three samples, 70 ng/ml threshold) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FIT was offered to 4,657 persons (Group A) and G-FOBT to 7,880 persons (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participation rate was 25.9% and 28.8% in Group A and B, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positivity rate in Group A and B was 12.7% and 3.9%, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
