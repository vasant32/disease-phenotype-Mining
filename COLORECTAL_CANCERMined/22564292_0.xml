<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a major challenge in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery due to increased morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Possible risk factors should be investigated differentially, distinguishing between rectal and colonic surgery in large-scale studies to avoid selection bias and confounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The incidence and risk factors associated with AL were analysed in an unselected nationwide prospective cohort of patient subjected to curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> surgery with primary anastomosis and entered into The Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Group database between May 2001 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AL occurred in 593 (6.4%) of 9333 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery [odds ratio (OR) 1.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.70; P=0.03); left hemicolectomy (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.50-2.72; P=0.01) or sigmoid colectomy (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.32-2.17; P=0.01); intra-operative blood loss (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.07; P=0.03); blood transfusion (OR 10.27; 95% CI 6.82-15.45; P&lt;0.001) and male gender (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.12-1.75; P=0.02) were associated with AL in the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The main finding that a laparoscopic approach was associated with an increased risk of AL should prompt close future monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that centralization of surgery to high-volume hospitals reduced the rate of AL </plain></SENT>
