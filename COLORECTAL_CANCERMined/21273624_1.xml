<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this pharmacogenetic trial was to study the relevance of thymidylate synthase (TS) genotyping and of the isoform 1A1 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) in order to tailor a combination chemotherapy regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with favourable TS and UGT1A1 profiles received high-dose (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with TS-3R/3R could not receive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-FOLFIRI, and those with UGT1A1-7/7 received standard FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endpoints were overall response rate and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (30.8%) achieved a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The haematological toxicity was less in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-FOLFIRI subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients having received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-FOLFIRI did not experience increased levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, asthenia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diarrhoea was more frequent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The genotypic assessment allowed a safer use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further investigations may target patients who benefit from intensification </plain></SENT>
