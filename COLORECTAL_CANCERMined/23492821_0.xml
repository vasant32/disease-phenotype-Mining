<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the United Kingdom, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> affects 1 in every 20 people and it is often detected once well established and after it has spread beyond the bowel (Stage IIA-C and Stage IIIA-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis at such advanced stages is associated with poor treatment response and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, studies have identified two sub-groups of post-treatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients-those with good outcome (reactive disease) and those with poor outcome (non-reactive disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aim to review the state-of-the-art for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with respect to the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-testis antigens (CTAs) and their identification, evaluation and correlation with disease progression, treatment response and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We will also discuss the relationship between CTA expression and regulatory T-cell (Treg) activity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immune evasion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and how this could account for the clinical presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Understanding the molecular basis of reactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may help us identify more potent novel immunotherapeutic targets to aid the effective treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, based on our presentation at the 2012 International Society for the Cell and Gene Therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> annual meeting, we will summarize some of the most current advances in CTA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> research and their influence on the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches for this common and at times difficult to treat disease </plain></SENT>
