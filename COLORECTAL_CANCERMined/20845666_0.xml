<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic and histopahtological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> significantly affect its outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of histopahological finding as a prognostic factor on the surgical treatment outcome and the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the first part of this study the distribution (numerical and proportional) of certain histopathological parameters in the examined groups of patients were reviewed; in the second part of the study the statistical significance of the impact of the certain elements of a histopahtological finding on the surgical treratment outcome was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histopathological elements analyzed included: the hsitological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type grading according to Duke, ie Astler-Coller, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, nodes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (TNM) staging in the examined sample of 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant prognostic factors of the outcome of surgical treatment were selected after multivariant analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These factors comprise Astler-Coller-Dukes stage D (revealed in 77.78% patients died), stage IV according TNM classification (T1-4, N0-2, M1), histological structure (poorly diferentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 85.2% patents died) and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (mucynous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was more often present in died, 77.78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since phi = 0.000 for four risk factors were formed using discriminant analysus, it was proved their significant influence on the outcome of surgical treatment Discriminant coefficient showed that the greatest influence on surgical treatment were registred in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of Astler-Coller-Dukes stage D (0.255), poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (histological structure) (0.139), mucynous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>) (0.074) and stage IV according to the TNM classification (T1-4, N0-2, M1) (0.39) </plain></SENT>
