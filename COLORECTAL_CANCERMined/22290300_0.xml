<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the prognostic impact of KRAS mutations is modulated by KRAS mutant allele-specific imbalance (MASI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KRAS MASI was assessed by sequencing electropherograms in KRAS-mutated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (N = 394, prospectively tested) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of KRAS MASI was studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; N = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH showed that KRAS MASI developed by chromosome 12 hyperploidy (9/18, 50%) or KRAS amplification (1/18, 5.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KRAS MASI was more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with KRAS codon 13 than with codon 12 mutations [24/81, 30% vs. 54/313, 17%; odds ratio (OR), 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-3.5; p = 0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS MASI was correlated with overall survival (N = 358, median follow-up = 21 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, KRAS codon 13 MASI was an independent adverse prognostic factor (compared to codon 13 mutants without MASI combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> codon 12 mutants; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-3.9; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS MASI arises through chromosome 12 hyperploidy or KRAS amplification and, when affects KRAS codon 13, is associated with worse overall survival </plain></SENT>
