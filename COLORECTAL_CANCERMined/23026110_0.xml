<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A review of 101 patients with these concurrent diagnoses was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent of patients had 1 or more additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>; none appeared to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> (LS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests the need for careful follow-up in these patients and further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Small studies have demonstrated that patients who have both colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> may be at increased risk for the development of additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A possible genetic basis has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study describes the clinicopathologic features of these patients and clarifies the relationship of this cohort with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> (LS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> treated at our institution were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue when possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 24,642 patients were treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 7,366 were treated for <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-nine patients had both diagnoses, with 101 patients eligible for inclusion in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were typically early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 2 cancers presented as synchronous lesions in 42% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients had 1 additional primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, 7 patients had 2 additional primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and 3 patients had 3 additional primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No patient had a family history that met the Amsterdam II criteria (AC) for LS, but 50% had family members with 1 malignancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One of 10 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> analyzed for the absence of MMR protein expression demonstrated the absence of MSH6, but the corresponding <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> demonstrated intact expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 MMR proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is rare for patients to be diagnosed with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathologic features of this cohort and the results of immunohistochemical analysis performed on a sample of these patients do not suggest LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the high rate of additional <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> suggests a need for careful follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Multicenter longitudinal studies are warranted to further understand the natural history and possible genetic basis for this entity </plain></SENT>
