<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that extracapsular invasion (ECI) at a metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sentinel node</z:e> was significantly associated with the presence of positive non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sentinel nodes</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of metastatic spreading of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to distant lymph nodes in patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the factors that may determine the likelihood of additional regional lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> is found in nodes at the N1 site in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially focusing on the presence of ECI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-eight consecutive patients who underwent colorectal resection were identified for inclusion in this study, of which 37 (16.2%) had positive lymph nodes at the N1 site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of these 37 cases had additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in N2 site lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the clinicopathological features of these cases and performed statistical analysis of the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the univariate analysis ECI at the N1 site was the only factor significantly associated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells in the N2 site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other factors, including number of positive lymph nodes, lymphovascular invasion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> depth of invasion, were not associated with metastatic involvement at the N2 site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the presence of ECI at metastatic lymph nodes at the N1 site is correlated with further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> at the N2 site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings imply the possibility that ECI might indicate the ability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> cells to disseminate to distant lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
