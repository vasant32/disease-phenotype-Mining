<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Family physicians play a central role in screening and are limited by the time constraints of clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients face multiple barriers that further reduce completion rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tools that support family physicians in providing their patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> information and that support uptake may prove useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a patient decision aid (nurse-managed telephone support line and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening website) distributed by community-based family physicians, in improving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives include evaluation of (dis)incentives to patient FOBT uptake and internet use among 50 to 74 year old males and females for health-related questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Challenges faced by family physicians in engaging in collaborative partnerships with primary healthcare researchers will be documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: A pragmatic, two-arm, randomized cluster controlled trial conducted in 22 community-based family practice clinics (36 clusters) with 76 fee-for-service family physicians in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each physician will enroll 30 patients attending their periodic health examination and at average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> physicians will follow their standard clinical practice for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intervention group physicians will provide a fridge magnet to each patient that contains information facilitating access to the study-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening decision <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> (telephone help-line and website) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is patient fecal occult blood test completion rate after four months (intention to treat model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multi-level analysis will include clinic, physician and patient level variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patient Personal Health Identification Numbers will be collected from those providing consent to facilitate analysis of repeat screening behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome data will be obtained through the Clinic Characterization Form, Patient Tracking Form, In-Clinic Patient Survey, Post-Study Follow-Up Patient Survey, and Family Physician Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Study protocol approved by The University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The study intervention has the potential to increase patient fecal occult blood test uptake, decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality and morbidity, and improve the health of Manitobans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>If utilization of the website and/or telephone support line result in clinically significant increases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening uptake, changes in screening at the policy- and system-level may be warranted </plain></SENT>
