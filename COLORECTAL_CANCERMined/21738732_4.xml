<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the past decade, a high incidence of somatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) mutations has been observed, mostly based on a fraction of the molecule, in various cancerous tissues; nevertheless, some of them were queried due to problems in data quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Obviously, without a comprehensive understanding of mtDNA mutational profile in the cancerous tissue of a specific patient, it is unlikely to disclose the genuine relationship between somatic mtDNA mutations and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To achieve this objective, the most straightforward way is to directly compare the whole mtDNA genome variation among three tissues (namely, cancerous tissue, para-cancerous tissue, and distant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue) from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considering the fact that most of the previous studies on the role of mtDNA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> focused merely on the D-loop or partial segment of the molecule, in the current study we have collected three tissues (cancerous, para-cancerous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues) respectively recruited from 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> and completely sequenced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome of each tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal a relatively lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in these patients; intriguingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> are in heteroplasmic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> are not restricted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues, for the para-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues and distant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues also harbor somatic mtDNA mutations with a lower frequency than cancerous tissues but higher than that observed in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that somatic mtDNA mutations in cancerous tissues could not be simply explained as a consequence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>; meanwhile, the somatic mtDNA mutations in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues might reflect an altered physiological environment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
