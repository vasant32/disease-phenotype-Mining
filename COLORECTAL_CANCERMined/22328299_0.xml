<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: CTCs of twelve consecutive patients with K-ras <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with synchronous and/or metachronous unresectable metastatic lesions were measured by the cell search system between January 2009 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CTCs were measured before and after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regimen consisted of four courses (three months) of SOX (TS-1+L-OHP) + panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients (33%) had no detectable CTCs before chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For these patients, no CTCs were detected after chemotherapy and their serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels decreased after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the other eight patients with positive CTCs had no detectable CTCs after chemotherapy and their serum CEA levels decreased after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other four of eight patients with positive CTCs continued to have CTCs after chemotherapy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> within eight months after starting chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients without CTCs after chemotherapy were alive over a year after starting chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: CTCs may be able to predict the response to chemotherapy in patients with unresectable metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CRC">colo rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
