<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mammalian transcriptional factors, Cdx1 and Cdx2 (Cdx is caudal-type homeobox) are paralogues and critical for the cellular differentiation of intestinal or colorectal epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported previously that in Cdx1 transgenic or knockout mice, endogenous Cdx2 levels are inversely correlated with Cdx1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found that exogenous Cdx1 expression can suppress Cdx2Â in a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> cell line, SW480, although the underlying molecular mechanisms were unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that several microRNAs induced by exogenous Cdx1 expression directly bind to the CDX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> 3'UTR (untranslated region) to destabilize these transcripts, finally leading to their degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using microarray analysis, we found that several miRNAs that were computationally predicted to target CDX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> are up-regulated by exogenous Cdx1 expression in SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these molecules, we identified miR-9, miR-16 and miR-22 as having the potential to suppress Cdx2 through the binding of the 3'UTR to its transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, simultaneous mutations of both the miR-9- and miR-16-binding sites in the CDX2 3'UTR were shown to be sufficient to block Cdx2 suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest a unique feature of miRNAs in which they contribute to homoeostasis by limiting the levels of transcription factors belonging to the same gene family </plain></SENT>
