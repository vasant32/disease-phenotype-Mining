<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 33 ce CT/PET studies of 19 patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them, 13 (68.4%) were males and 6 (31.6%) females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age and range were 63 [42-78] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases post-therapy diagnostic confirmation of liver lesions was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A ce CT PET/was obtained 1h after the injection of 370MBq of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metabolic and morphologic studies were evaluated by two blinded nuclear physicians and radiologists respectively to assess the location, size and suspected diagnosis of lesions (benign or malignant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combined assessment of both techniques was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis was established by histopathology or clinical/radiological follow-up greater than 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 120 liver lesions were identified, 115 were malignant and 5 benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the malignant lesions, 105 were identified with the ceCT, 44 with the PET and 109 with ceCT/PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the benign lesions were correctly classified with any of the three imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of PET, ceCT and ceCT/PET were of 38%, 91% and 95% respectively and the specificity was 100% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of the diagnostic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Administration of intravenous contrast in the PET/CT is mandatory to evaluate treatment response rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> due to the limitations of isolated metabolic images in these cases </plain></SENT>
