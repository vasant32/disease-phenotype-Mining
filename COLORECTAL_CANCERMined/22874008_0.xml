<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between dietary behaviours and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in the context of the Mediterranean diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (cases) were recruited from Saint Savvas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Hospital and Alexandra General Hospital in Athens, Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were voluntarily selected from the general population and matched to cases by age group (±10 years) and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Two hundred and fifty cases with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (mean age 63 (sd 12) years, 59·6 % males) and 250 controls matched on age and sex were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A standardized questionnaire assessing sociodemographic, clinical, lifestyle, dietary characteristics and nutritional behaviours was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the aforementioned factors in addition to the MedDietScore (an index that evaluates adherence to the Mediterranean diet) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The higher the daily number of meals, the lower the likelihood of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 0·74, 95 % CI 0·61, 0·89); coffee drinking was associated with higher likelihood of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 3·27, 95 % CI 1·09, 9·8); the use of non-stick cookware was positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 1·57, 95 % CI 1·02, 2·4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, these associations slightly lost their significance when adherence to the Mediterranean diet was taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a 1/75 increase in the modified-MedDietScore plus the aforementioned nutritional behaviours was associated with 13 % lower odds (95 % CI 0·83, 0·91, P &lt; 0·001) of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional behaviours in addition to dietary habits should be taken into account in detecting individuals prone to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
