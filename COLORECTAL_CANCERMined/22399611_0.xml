<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other rearrangements involving CCDC6 have also been identified demonstrating its high susceptibility to chromosomal recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignancies</z:e> bearing CCDC6 fusion genes are developed in a background where CCDC6 is either lost or deregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify interacting proteins which are affected by the silencing of CCDC6 expression and could possibly link CCDC6 deregulation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> causality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a proteomic approach was adopted using a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell-line (HCT116) where CCDC6 expression was silenced by lentiviral shRNA constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>14-3-3σ down-regulation in the absence of CCDC6 was revealed and verified by western blot analysis and confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the levels and not the topology of CCDC6 were altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The down-regulation of 14-3-3σ in the absence of CCDC6 demonstrated their direct association and supports the notion that CCDC6 contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development, possibly through malignant pathways involving 14-3-3σ </plain></SENT>
