<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 56-year-old man was diagnosed as having unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0861772" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage IV rectal cancer</z:e> with local invasion and lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and underwent systemic chemotherapy by FOLFOX, combined with panitumumab as a first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 3 courses of FOLFOX and 3 courses of FOLFOX with panitumumab, the treatment regimen was changed to FOLFIRI with panitumumab to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 5 courses of FOLFIRI with panitumumab, pelvic computed tomography(CT)revealed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> was markedly reduced, and the intrapelvic direct invasion was resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the post-treatment chest CT, lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> had disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A low anterior resection preserving the automatic nerves, the colonic J-pouch and anal anastomosis, was performed 20 days after the last chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the whole <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-like lesion of the specimen was sectioned macroscopically at 5-mm intervals, no vivid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were detected at the pathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and no recurrence occurred 5 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EGFR receptor antibody is reported to have a significant anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> effect for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> without the KRAS gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cases with relatively large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> especially, EGFR antibody can be an effective first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
