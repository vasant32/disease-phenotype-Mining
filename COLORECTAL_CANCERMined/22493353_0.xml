<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Candidate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-1 (COM-1) is a molecule which is stress-induced and cell growth-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study investigated the impact of COM-1 and role of Peroxisome Proliferating Activator Receptor-gamma (PPARγ) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> on COM-1 knock down in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of COM-1 was knocked out in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines RKO and CaCO2 by transfection with ribozyme transgenes which specifically targeted COM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell growth, cell migration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were measured in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, control and COM-1 knock down cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact or treatment with the PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> on the function of COM-1 knock down cells was monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: COM-1 knock-down cells grew slower than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When treated with the PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> ciglitazone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33216">bisphenol A</z:chebi> diglycidyl <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi> (BADGE) at several different concentrations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of cells grew slower to some extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cells with COM-1 knock-down had the same mobility as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More apoptotic and dead cells were detected when cells were treated with ciglitazone at 3 μM, especially of COM-1 knock down cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: COM-1 is an anti-apoptotic gene and a cell growth promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> could increase the inhibitory effect seen in COM-1 knock-down cell growth and to promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In regards to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, COM-1 appears to play no role in cell motility </plain></SENT>
