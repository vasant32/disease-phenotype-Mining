<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This population-based study investigated the relationship between individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and mortality rates for major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based follow-up study was conducted with 20,488 cancer patients diagnosed in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was traced to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The individual income-related insurance payment amount was used as a proxy measure of individual SES for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neighborhood SES was defined by income, and neighborhoods were grouped as living in advantaged or disadvantaged areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-free survival rates between the different SES groups after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for patient characteristics (age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index Score, urbanization, and area of residence), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extent, treatment modalities (operation and adjuvant therapy), and hospital characteristics (ownership and teaching level), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e> patients under 65 years old with low individual SES in disadvantaged neighborhoods conferred a 1.5 to 2-fold higher risk of mortality, compared with patients with high individual SES in advantaged neighborhoods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cross-level interaction effect was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lung cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients less than 65 years old with low SES in advantaged neighborhoods carried the highest risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>Prostate cancer</z:hpo> patients aged 65 and above with low SES in disadvantaged neighborhoods incurred the highest risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no association between SES and mortality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with low individual SES have the highest risk of mortality even under a universal health-care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Public health strategies and welfare policies must continue to focus on this vulnerable group </plain></SENT>
