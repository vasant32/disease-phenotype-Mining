<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on the safety and activity of BIFF (bevacizumab plus IRIFAFU) regimen in 94 mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg (1 hour), and irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) (1 hour) were given intravenously on day 1, 6S-folinic acid 250 mg/m(2) (2 hours), and fluorouracil 850 mg/m(2) (bolus) were given intravenously on day 2 every 2 weeks for a median of 9 cycles per patient (range, 1-12), and maintenance bevacizumab alone was delivered in 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Grade â‰¥ 3 hematologic toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (50%) and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most common grade 3 nonhematologic side effects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (20%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (1%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> (1%) rarely occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six complete responses and 44 partial responses were registered, giving a response rate of 53% (95% CI, 43%-64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 11.5 months (95% CI, 9.0-14.0 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-three (46%) patients eventually died, and the median overall survival was 24.0 months (95% CI, 20.2-27.8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab appeared to increase the activity of the IRIFAFU regimen without worsening its tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of BIFF was comparable with that reported with other bevacizumab plus irinotecan-based combinations </plain></SENT>
