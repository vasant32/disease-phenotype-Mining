<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explores the clinical and biological effects of combined blockade of these pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cetuximab-naive patients with refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were treated with cetuximab (400 mg/m loading dose followed by weekly cetuximab at 250 mg/m) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> (200 mg orally twice daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M, a stable metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> that correlates with in vivo COX-2 activity, and serum TGF-α, a ligand that binds to EGFR, were measured serially to assess the biological effect of COX-2 and EGFR blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients accrued in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 patients evaluable for response, 2 (15.4%) had confirmed partial responses, 4 (30.8%) had stable disease, and 7 (53.8%) had progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluable patients was 55 days (95% confidence interval, 45-112; range, 10-295 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study was terminated early owing to lack of sufficient clinical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in serum TGF-α or urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M between cycles in responders or nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This regimen resulted in response rates similar to those published for cetuximab monotherapy in patients with recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Apart from a higher than expected rate of infusion reactions, no other unexpected toxicities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No differences in serum TGF-α or urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>-M between cycles were seen, suggesting that the appropriate targets may not have been hit </plain></SENT>
