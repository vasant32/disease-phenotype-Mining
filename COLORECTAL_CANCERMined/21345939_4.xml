<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is a lack of data regarding the effectiveness of modern chemotherapy in patients with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with synchronous PC of colorectal origin diagnosed in the Eindhoven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry registration area between 1995 and 2008 were included (N = 904) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the use of chemotherapy and overall survival in three time periods related to the availability of different chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chemotherapy use gradually increased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival (MS) for patients with PC without other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> diagnosed in 1995-2000 was 35 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI) 24-43] and 34 weeks (25-54) in 2005-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MS in patients diagnosed with PC plus other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was 21 weeks (15-27) in 1995-2000 and 26 weeks (18-33) in 2005-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable regression analysis, use of chemotherapy had a beneficial influence on survival only in 2005-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the first two periods, chemotherapy treatment did not decrease the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite increasing usage of palliative chemotherapy and availability of new agents, population-based survival of patients with PC did not improve until very recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Response to palliative chemotherapy in PC should be evaluated separately from haematogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
