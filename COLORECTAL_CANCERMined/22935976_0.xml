<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is abnormally activated in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two different categories of compounds targeting EGFR, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> (TKIs), which target extracellular and intracellular domains of the receptor, respectively, have shown antitumour activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We decided to explore whether the combined administration of cetuximab, a mAb, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi>, a TKI, had superior antitumour activity than either agent given alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the effects of cetuximab alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi> alone and the combination of cetuximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi> in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, HT-29 and LoVo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of these two agents on cell proliferation and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dose-dependent activity of cetuximab alone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi> alone or the combination was observed for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the combined treatment with cetuximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi> resulted in a synergistic and more pronounced growth effect on cell proliferation and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than either single-agent treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that combined treatment with distinct EGFR inhibitory agents can augment the antitumour response over that realised with a single EGFR inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New and tempting treatment strategies on the EGFR target consisting of a double hit with a mAb and a TKI may improve the therapeutic ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in future clinical trials </plain></SENT>
