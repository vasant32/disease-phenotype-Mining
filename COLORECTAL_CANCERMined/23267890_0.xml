<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MDSCs have been reported to accumulate in the blood, lymph nodes, and at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sites in most patients during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, where they potentially suppress T cell functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed MDSCs (CD11b+ CD14- CD33+) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by flow cytometry in 222 patients with esophageal, gastric, colorectal, hepatocellular, cholangiocellular, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, thyroid, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, and 18 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MDSCs were significantly higher in patients with esophageal, gastric, colorectal, hepatocellular, pancreatic, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> than in healthy volunteers, and the differences were not significant in patients with cholangiocellular, ovarian, thyroid, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Production of the cytokines IFN-γ and IL-6 in response to phytohemagglutinin was assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of sIL-2R were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentages of MDSCs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> positively correlated with neutrophil counts and the concentration of sIL-2R(both p&lt;0.05), and inversely correlated with the production of IFN-γ( p&lt;0.0001), serum albumin concentration(p&lt;0.005), and lymphocyte counts (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that MDSCs are strongly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and nutritional impairment </plain></SENT>
