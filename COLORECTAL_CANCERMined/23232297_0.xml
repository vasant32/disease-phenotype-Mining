<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis of long-term outcomes of patients treated for submucosal colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data on 549 patients with submucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 209 patients with submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who underwent endoscopic or surgical resection at 6 institutions over a median follow-up period of 60.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into one of 3 groups: low-risk patients undergoing only endoscopic resection (group A), high-risk patients undergoing only endoscopic resection (group B), and high-risk patients undergoing surgical resection that included lymph node dissection (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed recurrence rates, 5-year disease-free survival, and 5-year overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis was used to compare recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rates of recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival in group A for submucosal colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> were 0% versus 6.3% (P &lt; .05), 96% versus 90%, and 96% versus 89%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For group B, these values were 1.4% versus 16.2% (P &lt; .01), 96% versus 77% (P &lt; .01), and 98% versus 96%, respectively; local recurrence was observed in 5 patients (one with submucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 4 with submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> location was the only factor that contributed significantly to disease recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 6.73; P = .045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For group C, these values were 1.9% versus 4.5%, 97% versus 95%, and 99% versus 97%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk for local recurrence was significantly higher in high-risk patients with submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> than in patients with submucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> when treated with only endoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The addition of surgery is therefore recommended for patients with submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> with pathologic features indicating a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>; University Hospital Medical Network Clinical Trials Registry, Number: UMIN 000008635 </plain></SENT>
