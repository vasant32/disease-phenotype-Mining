<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Until 2004, we treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> with cytoreductive surgery accompanied by perioperative systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From October 2004, we decided to initiate a hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) program for this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of HIPEC on postoperative outcomes at a single institution performing a high volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sixty consecutive patients underwent cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>; 460 mg/m2 in 2 L/m2) from October 1, 2004, through December 31, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Usual perioperative factors were studied for 3 groups of patients who underwent HIPEC: 0 to 20 HIPEC procedures (period 1), 21 to 40 HIPEC procedures (period 2), and 41 to 60 HIPEC procedures (period 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> index was 9.6, the mean duration of surgery was 410.7 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 450.2 mL/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality and morbidity were 0% and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade III/IV morbidity (P = .02), transfusion (P &lt; .01), and reintervention rate (P = .04) significantly decreased during the 3 periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference was seen between the 3 periods with regard to mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> index, operative duration, blood loss, mortality, overall morbidity, length of hospital stay, and readmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 26 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> originating from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were 100%, 51%, and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall median survival was 39 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant reduction of grade III/IV morbidity, perioperative transfusion, and reintervention rate after 20 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The introduction of the HIPEC program was successful because of the surgical team's prior experience in cytoreductive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> operations </plain></SENT>
