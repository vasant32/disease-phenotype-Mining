<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several polymorphisms of XPC gene may modulate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association of XPC Lys939Gln (A/C), Ala499Val (C/T), and PAT (-/+) polymorphisms with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in a population-based case-control study which included 421 CRC patients and 845 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For Lys939Gln, the CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (odds ratio (OR)=1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.0-2.2) compared with the AA genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects with PAT +/+ genotype had a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR=1.5; 95% CI=1.0-2.3), compared with those with PAT-/- genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Though no significant association between Ala499Val and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was observed, we found that individuals carrying the CT+TT genotypes showed a significantly decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (OR=0.7; 95% CI=0.5-1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the haplotype C+C was associated with a significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (OR=1.3; 95% CI=1.0-1.6), compared with the most common haplotype A-T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, individuals with four or more risk alleles exhibited a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR=1.4; 95% CI=1.0-2.0), with a significant gene-dosage effect (P for trend=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides, never tea drinking was associated with a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR=2.3; 95% CI=1.7-3.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the XPC polymorphisms may modulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility independently or jointly, and tea drinking has a protective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
