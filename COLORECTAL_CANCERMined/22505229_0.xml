<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mitochondrion is the key organelle in which <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether DNA methylation at the displacement loop (D-loop) region of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) has an effect on the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme, and, therefore, on oxidative phosphorylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative change in ND2 (a subunit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>) and the methylation status of the D-loop were observed during the initiation and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the possible correlations with clinicopathological stage were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> and corresponding non-cancerous tissues were surgically resected from 44 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients between 2008 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox IV expression was quantified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the specimens, and the ND2 expression was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative changes in ND2 expression exhibited a significant increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average relative ratios of ND2 content were 1.67±0.44 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and 0.89±0.44 in the corresponding non-cancerous tissues (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the D-loop of most corresponding non-cancerous tissues was methylated and the percentage was 79.5%, while this percentage was much smaller in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues (11.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following correlation with clinicopathological data, changes in the ND2 expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> exhibited a significant association with clinicopathological stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This increase was significant as early as in stage Ⅰ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ratios of unmethylated D-loop cases were increased in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and corresponding non-cancerous tissues, and the ND2 expression was also increased from stages Ⅰ to Ⅳ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that demethylation of the D-loop plays a key role in regulating ND2 expression during the initiation and/or progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
