<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Extensive evidence has suggested that risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development may also modulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predisposing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the pivotal importance of these variants in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we sought to evaluate their associations with clinical outcomes of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a well-characterised cohort including 380 Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, we genotyped seven SNPs identified in previous multi-stage GWA studies and analysed their associations with patient recurrence and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One SNP on chromosome 15q13, rs4779584 was associated with reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.72, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another SNP in a gene-desert region on chromosome 10p14, rs10795668, was associated with a reduced risk of recurrence with an HR of 0.55 (95% CI 0.30-1.00, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a stratified analysis, this association was only evident in patients receiving chemotherapy (HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.78, P = 0.01, log rank P = 0.004), but not in those without chemotherapy (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.43-2.73, P = 0.87, log rank P = 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that the effects of chemotherapy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence was only evident in patients with the variant-containing genotypes (HR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.13-0.94, P = 0.04) but not in those with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype of rs10795668 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further analyses indicated a borderline significant interaction effect (P interaction = 0.05) between rs10795668 and chemotherapy on patient recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that rs10795668, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility variant identified by GWA studies, might be used as a biomarker to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with high risk of recurrence after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
