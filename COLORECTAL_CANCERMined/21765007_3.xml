<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several previous studies are small and few investigated the association between <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among women whose <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> metabolism may differ from men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, genetic variants in selenoenzymes may be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This nested case-control study investigated whether serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> concentration and genetic variants in five selenoenzymes (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase 1-4 and selenoprotein P) were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in 804 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 805 matched controls from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the WHI result with previous studies including 12 observational studies and two clinical trials on <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the WHI, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> concentrations were relatively high (mean = 135.6 Î¼g/L) and were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (P(trend) = 0.10); the adjusted OR comparing the fifth with first quintile was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.91-1.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, genetic variants in selenoenzymes were not significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the finding in WHI, our meta-analysis showed no association between <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> risk in women (OR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79-1.18) comparing the highest quantile with the lowest); however, in men, there was a significant inverse association (OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.82) (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous studies, we observed no protective effect of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Our analyses suggest that a population with relatively high <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> concentrations, especially women, would not benefit from increasing <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
