<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most genetic studies in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> have focused on those abnormalities that are acquired by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, particularly in the transition from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, whereas few studies have compared the genetic abnormalities of primary versus paired metastatic samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used high-density 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to map the overall genetic changes present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (n=20) from untreated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients studied at diagnosis versus their paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 gene expression was measured in parallel by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> systematically contained those genetic abnormalities observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> sample from the same subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from many cases (up to 8 out of 20) showed acquisition of genetic aberrations that were not found in their paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These new metastatic aberrations mainly consisted of (1) an increased frequency of genetic lesions of chromosomes that have been associated with metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (1p, 7p, 8q, 13q, 17p, 18q, 20q) and, more interestingly, (2) acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities (eg, losses of chromosomes 4 and 10q and gains of chromosomes 5p and 6p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These genetic changes acquired by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> may be associated with either the metastatic process and/or adaption of metastatic cells to the liver microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies in larger series of patients are necessary to dissect the specific role of each of the altered genes and chromosomal regions in the metastatic spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
