<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Irinotecan-na√Øve patients were randomized to receive either irinotecan (350 mg/m(2)) or HA-Irinotecan (HA 1,000 mg/m(2) and irinotecan at 350 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks for a maximum of eight cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (41 HA-Irinotecan and 35 irinotecan-alone) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in any individual, or overall, grade 3 or 4 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in the HA-Irinotecan-treated patients (20 versus 9%; P = 21), potentially explained by a disproportionate number of baseline toxicity-associated risk factors in this treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median number of cycles completed was six for HA-Irinotecan patients and two for irinotecan-alone patients (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared to the control arm, HA-Irinotecan patients had a significantly longer median progression-free survival of 5.2 versus 2.4 months (P = 0.017) and time to treatment failure (4 vs. 1.8 months; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 10.1 months for HA-Irinotecan compared to 8.0 months for irinotecan patients (P = 0.196) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Further studies are required to define the safety of the formulation of irinotecan with HA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While this study was not adequately powered to demonstrate survival differences, these phase II data indicated HA-Irinotecan to be a promising therapy demonstrating improved efficacy compared to irinotecan-alone </plain></SENT>
