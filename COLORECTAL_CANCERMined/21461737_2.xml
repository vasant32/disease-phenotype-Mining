<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These parameters could potentially have clinical value in response to treatment evaluation and disease prognostication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> parameters (FTV and TLG) and clinical outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRCLM) undergoing (90)Y-resin microsphere selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) (SIR-SpheresÂ®, Sirtex Medical Limited, Lane Cove, NSW, Australia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FDG PET/CT studies of 20 patients with unresectable CRCLM who underwent (90)Y SIRT under a phase II clinical trial were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FTV and TLG were calculated using PET VCAR (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) on pretreatment and 4-week posttreatment scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of pretreatment and posttreatment functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity on patient survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median survival in the study group was 14.8 months (range 2.0-27.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival for patients with pretreatment FTV values of above and below 200 cc were 11.2 and 26.9 months, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival for patients with 4-week posttreatment FTV values of above and below 30 cc were 10.9 and 26.9 months, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival for patients with pretreatment TLG values of above and below 600 g were 11.2 and 26.9 months, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival for patients with 4-week posttreatment TLG values of above and below 100 g were 10.9 and 26.9 months, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pretreatment and posttreatment FTV and TLG showed very strong association with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These values can be useful quantitative criteria for patient selection and disease prognostication when (90)Y SIRT is contemplated in patients with CRCLM </plain></SENT>
