<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To elucidate the role of Semaphorin-3F (SEMA3F), originally described as an axon guiding chemorepulsant implicated in nerve development, in the progression of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: SEMA3F and its receptor NRP2 were examined in 72 cases of human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> specimens and cell lines LoVo, SW480, and SW620 with immunohistochemistry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SEMA3F <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the frozen tissue specimens and cell lines was examined with quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used for detection of cellular localization of the proteins by immunofluorescent staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, flow cytometry, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration, and xenografts were used to evaluate biological significance of SEMA3F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SEMA3F was significantly reduced in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of SEMA3F resulted in reduced proliferation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to fibronectin, and migratory capability as well as reduced S-phase population and integrin αvβ3 expression of SW480 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, SEMA3F-overexpressing cells exhibited diminished <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> when transplanted orthotopically in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, transfection of siRNA targeting SEMA3F in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells increased their tumorigenicity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous SEMA3F acts as a suppressor of the growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
