<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although chemotherapy is still one of the best treatments for most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, immunotherapies such as dendritic cell (DC) vaccines have emerged as an alternative protocol for destroying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated antitumor effects of the combined therapy using DC vaccine and irinotecan plus infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) which have been clinically used for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A maximum tolerated dose of FOLFIRI was preliminarily determined for MC38/CEA2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vaccination with DC expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) enhanced antitumor effect after FOLFIRI treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combined therapy also increased CEA-specific Th1 and cytotoxic T-cell responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, although FOLFIRI treatment rather showed a rebound in the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T-cells (Treg) after 14 days, additional DC vaccine could inhibit the rebound of these immunosuppressive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mice cured by the combined therapy showed antigen-specific T-cell responses and resistance against challenge of MC38/CEA2 compared with mice cured with FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that DC vaccine in addition to FOLFIRI regimen could improve antitumor effects through the inhibition of immunosuppressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> environments in murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> model, and may provide knowledge useful for the design of chemo-immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
