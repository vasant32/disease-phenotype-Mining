<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Cub and Sushi Multiple Domains 1 (CSMD1) gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 8, codes for a type I transmembrane protein whose function is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSMD1 expression is frequently lost in many epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to characterize the relationships between CSMD1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>, allele imbalance, DNA methylation, and the clinical characteristics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We sequenced the CSMD1 coding regions in 54 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> using the 454FLX pyrosequencing platform to interrogate 72 amplicons covering the entire coding sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used heterozygous SNP allele ratios at multiple CSMD1 loci to determine allelic balance and infer loss of heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we performed methylation-specific PCR on 76 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> to determine DNA methylation status for CSMD1 and known methylation targets ALX4, RUNX3, NEUROG1, and CDKN2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using 454FLX sequencing and confirming with Sanger sequencing, 16 CSMD1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were identified in 6 of the 54 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation ratio of the 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> was 15∶1, a ratio significantly higher than the expected 2∶1 ratio (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This ratio indicates a presence of positive selection for mutations in the CSMD1 protein sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSMD1 allelic imbalance was present in 19 of 37 informative cases (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with allelic imbalance and CSMD1 mutations were significantly younger (average age, 41 years) than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> (average age, 68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were methylated at one or more CpG loci within the CSMD1 coding sequence, and CSMD1 methylation significantly correlated with two known methylation targets ALX4 and RUNX3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>C:G&gt;T:A substitutions were significantly overrepresented (47%), suggesting extensive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> methylation predisposing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Deep amplicon sequencing and methylation-specific PCR reveal that CSMD1 alterations can correlate with earlier clinical presentation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, thus further implicating CSMD1 as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
