<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The completeness of such a collection was evaluated using capture-recapture analysis based on three data sources concerning breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> over an identical period and within the same geographical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The total number of breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cases was estimated using capture-recapture analysis based on the number of cases which were common or not between sources recording screened, diagnosed and treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in the French Alpes Maritimes district </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The estimated total number of new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnosed among Alpes Maritimes residents women aged 50-75 was 791 (95% CI: 784-797) in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 791 cases, 729 were identified through histopathology records, thus amounting to 92.2% completeness (95% CI: 91.5-93.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total estimated number of new cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed among Alpes Maritimes residents aged 50-75 was 527 (95% CI: 517-536) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 527 cases, 481 were identified through histopathology records, thus amounting to 91.3% completeness (95% CI: 89.7-93.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The estimated completeness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> records collected from histopathology laboratories was higher than 90% for new cases of breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> within the age range concerned by the screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A verified and validated histopathology data collection may be useful for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> population studies </plain></SENT>
