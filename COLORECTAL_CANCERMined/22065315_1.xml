<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 54-year-old female with now resectable colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CRLM) (segments III, IVb, V-VIII) underwent a two-staged procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Segment III resection, right portal vein transection and an in situ split procedure (first stage) after 3D volumetry based on CT data and a right trisegmentectomy (second stage) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RO resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was achieved, and the postoperative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proposed strategy seems to be a promising method to achieve higher resectability rates in CRLM patients </plain></SENT>
