<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify whether operative time as a surrogate for resident involvement increased the risk of future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing curative colon resection from 2001 to 2010 at two military residency training hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative time as well as preoperative comorbidities and perioperative factors were gathered from electronic medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Liver metastases</z:e> were identified from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> registry and inpatient records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 106 patients underwent resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (Stage I-III) from 2001 to 2005 with 5-year follow-up through 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative times in patients who had recurrence was 205 +/- 60 minutes and those without recurrence was 187 +/- 73 minutes (p = 0.398) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between operative time and time to recurrence (p = 0.452), and Cox regression demonstrated that case duration had no impact on time to metastatic recurrence (p = 0.461) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within our cohort, operative time had no impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgeons should continue to focus on proper oncologic principles and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biology rather than the concern that increased operative time or resident training leads to increased metastatic recurrence </plain></SENT>
