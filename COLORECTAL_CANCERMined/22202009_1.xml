<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are available for biomarker studies, the stability of miRNAs in these tissues stored for long periods (more than 20 years) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present effort involved analysis of 345 FFPE <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues, stored for 6 to 28 years (1982-2004), for the expression of six miRNAs (miR-20a, miR-21, miR-106a, miR-181b, miR-203, and miR-324-5p) using TaqMan(r) microRNA assays and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation, by linear regression analysis, of miRNA expression among archived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues found similar levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six miRNAs in tissues stored over this period (correlation coefficients, R2, ranged from less than 0.0001-0.009; and t-test p-values were greater than or equal to 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, miRNAs are stable in FFPE tissues stored for long periods of time, and such samples can be used for discovery of biomarkers </plain></SENT>
