<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study an ultra-pressure liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the targeted profiling of eight relevant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> and the major metabolic precursor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA), in human colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) experiments were performed in negative electrospray ionization mode </plain></SENT>
