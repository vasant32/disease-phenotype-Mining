<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Social networks may influence screening behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether screening for breast, prostate, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is influenced by the actual screening behaviors of siblings, friends, spouses, and coworkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted an observational study using Framingham Heart Study data to assess screening for eligible individuals during the late 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to determine whether the probability of screening for breast, prostate, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was influenced by the proportion of siblings, friends, and coworkers who had the same screening, as well as spouse's screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, adjusting for other factors that might influence screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1660 women aged 41-70 years, 71.7% reported mammography in the previous year; among 1217 men aged 51-70 years, 43.3% reported prostate-specific antigen testing in the previous year; and among 1426 men and women aged 51-80 years, 46.9% reported stool blood testing and/or sigmoidoscopy in the previous year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increasing proportion of sisters who had mammography in the previous year was associated with mammography screening in the ego (odds ratio [OR], 1.034; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.000-1.065 for each 10% increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A spouse with recent screening was associated with more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.39-1.98 vs unmarried) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, screening behaviors of siblings, friends, and coworkers were not associated with screening in the ego </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aside from a slight increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening among women whose sisters were screened and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening if spouses were screened, the screening behavior of siblings, friends, or coworkers did not influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening behaviors </plain></SENT>
