<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are some differences between Japan and Western countries in environments and clinical settings for performing ESD in the colorectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists who perform colorectal ESD around the world are considering that refinements in ESD techniques, devices and training will be necessary to further reduce a higher risk of complications and longer procedure times before adoption of ESD can be recommended on a widespread international scale </plain></SENT>
