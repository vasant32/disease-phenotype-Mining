<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study compared GTA-446 levels in subjects diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at the time of colonoscopy to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples and pathology data were collected from 4,923 representative subjects undergoing colonoscopy and from 964 subjects from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum GTA-446 levels were determined using a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A low-serum GTA-446 level was based on the bottom tenth percentile of subjects with low risk based on age (40-49 years old) in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subjects (87% for stages 0-II and 85% for stages III-IV) showed low-serum GTA-446 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rate with age was observed in subjects with low GTA-446 levels (p = 0.019), but not in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels (p = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> given a low GTA-446 level was the highest for subjects under age 50 (10.1, 95% confidence interval [C.I.] = 6.4-16.4 in the reference population, and 7.7, 95% C.I. = 4.4-14.1 in the colonoscopy population, both p &lt; 0.0001), and declined with age thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rate in subjects undergoing colonoscopy with low GTA-446 levels was over six times higher than for subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GTA-446 levels and twice that of subjects with gastrointestinal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results show that a low-serum GTA-446 level is a significant risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and a sensitive predictor of early-stage disease </plain></SENT>
