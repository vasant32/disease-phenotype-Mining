<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally this has been performed with quadrantic random biopsies throughout the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromoendoscopy "dye-spray" with targeted biopsies only has been shown to increase <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection 4 to 5 fold on a per lesion basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has therefore been suggested that random biopsies should be abandoned as they do not increase <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection nor change patient clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent British guidelines for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> surveillance have strongly endorsed chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This short review summarizes current international guidelines and looks at how to optimize white light colonoscopy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> considering: bowel preparation, withdrawal time, high definition, and structure enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data for advanced imaging techniques are reviewed including positive evidence in favor of chromoendoscopy, and limited data suggesting autofluoresence imaging may be promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Narrow band imaging does not increase <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Confocal endomicroscopy might potentially reduce biopsies beyond that of chromoendoscopy but does not offer a clear detection advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pan-colonic chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection and is the standard of care in the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the use of chromoendoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> surveillance will become widely accepted internationally </plain></SENT>
