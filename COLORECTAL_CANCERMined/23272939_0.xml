<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The choice of test relates to the objectives of those offering or considering screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screening programs aim to detect disease early in order to improve the length and/or quality of life for the individual, some organizations and individuals prefer screening tests that offer the opportunity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Others favor maximizing participation or the opportunity for shared decision-making, including discussion of information on test quality and availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose three additional objectives for screening: minimizing harms, optimizing economic efficiency and maximizing equity of access to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Applying these objectives to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, we advocate the use of immunochemical FOBTs as the preferred screening strategy, as it satisfies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of these important objectives </plain></SENT>
