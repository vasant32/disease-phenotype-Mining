<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) is the only treatment offering the possibility of cure and has been shown to provide clear survival benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only 10 to 20% of patients with CRLM are eligible for this procedure upfront </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the last decade, major advances in the management of CRLM have taken place involving three fields: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo>, interventional radiology, and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These advances have increased the resectability rate to 20-30% of cases with a 5-year survival of 35-50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and hepatic artery infusion combined with systemic therapy and biologic agents (bevacizumab, cetuximab) play an important role in increasing the number of patients eligible to secondary resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, with the progressive use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy further studies are necessary to answer questions such as the risk: benefit ratio in maximizing response rates versus vascular changes in the liver (current opinion still divided concerning their importance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These questions remain challenging and should not be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this review, we have described the current oncosurgical strategies employed in patients with resectable and non resectable CRLM, their benefits, and future treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
