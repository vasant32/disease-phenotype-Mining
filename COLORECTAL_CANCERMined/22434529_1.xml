<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: National surveys have reported declines in rates of home-based fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic differences in FOBT trends and their changes relative to endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening have not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on adults ages 50 to 64 years from the 2000, 2005, and 2008 National Health Interview Surveys were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weighted analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to study trends in the use of FOBT and endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2008, significant declines in FOBT prevalence occurred in higher SES groups, but not in lower SES groups (uninsured and publicly insured, those without a usual source of care, lower educated, lower income, and immigrants to the United States) or Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening during the period studied consistently increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> higher SES subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, few lower SES subgroups (publicly insured, lower educated, near poor individuals, long-term immigrants) and Hispanics experienced increases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> endoscopic screening, and these increases were smaller than those observed in higher SES subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Socially and economically disadvantaged groups experienced little or no change in FOBT prevalence, and few of these groups experienced contemporaneous increases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> endoscopic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These trends suggest the continued availability and acceptance of FOBT in these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If national <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening goals are to be achieved in populations with lower access to colonoscopy, then annual high-sensitivity FOBT should be promoted as an immediately accessible and viable alternative </plain></SENT>
