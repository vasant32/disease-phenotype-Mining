<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the association, we performed a comprehensive literature search and a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched multiple databases to identify genetic association studies investigating the effect of miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism on GI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with the last report up to January 18, 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were calculated to assess the strength of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 studies including 4,947 cases and 5,642 controls based on the search criteria were involved in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the overall analysis, it was suggested that variant C allele of miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism could significantly increase risk of GI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in different genetic models (C vs T: OR = 1.17, 95 % CI = 1.07-1.28, P = 0.0008; CT + CC vs TT: OR = 1.26, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.48, P = 0.004; CC vs CT + TT: OR = 1.23, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.39, P = 0.002; CC vs TT: OR = 1.55, 95 % CI = 1.24-1.94, P = 0.0001; CT vs TT: OR = 1.20, 95 % CI = 1.02-1.40, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When stratified by ethnicity, we found a significant association in Asian population, as well as Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When stratified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types, we found a significant association in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not find a significant association between miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, a significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk was observed only in homozygote comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis demonstrates that miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism is significantly associated with risk of GI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
