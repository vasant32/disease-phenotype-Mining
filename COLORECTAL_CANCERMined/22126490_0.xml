<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effect of GSTM1 deletion on susceptibility to developing clinical outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from Isfahan province, Iran, in comparison to age and gender matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was extracted from blood of 140 CRC patients and 90 healthy individuals and a set of sequence specific hybridization probes was used for GSTM1 genotyping by real-time PCR in Light-Cycler instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chi-squared test was used to assess the statistical significance of observed differences between the patient and control subjects of different genders and ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To estimate the risk for overall and stratified analyses, odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed with logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference in GSTM1 null genotype frequency was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and controls stratified by gender (p value=0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data were suggested a trend of increasing risk for GSTM1 null genotype in patients over 60 years old compared with controls (p value=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GSTM1 null genotype carried an increase of the odds of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients over 60 years old (OR=2.7; 95% CI: 1.03-7.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found (P&gt;0.05) between the GSTM1 null genotype with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site (right, left, rectum) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation (well, moderately) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the GSTM1 null genotype may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development in people over 60 years old </plain></SENT>
