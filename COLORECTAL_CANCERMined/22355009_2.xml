<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: An intact immune system likely contributes to the outcome of treatment and may be important for clearance of drug-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and for prevention of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF(V600E) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> patients, which is linked to immune suppression, results in an initial response rate, these responses are typically of limited duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Combining immunotherapeutic drugs with kinase-targeted agents is an attractive strategy to increase clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase pathway activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells contributes to immune suppression suggests that the two approaches may be synergistic, provided that BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are nontoxic to immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods: To assess effects of mutant BRAF inhibition on systemic immunity, we studied 13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> carrying a BRAF mutation who underwent treatment with GSK2118436, a V600 mutant BRAF-specific inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We carried out peripheral blood immunomonitoring before and following one or two 28-day cycles of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GSK2118436 treatment had no detectable impact on most immune parameters tested, including serum cytokine levels, peripheral blood cell counts, leukocyte subset frequencies, and memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell recall responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A slight increase in serum TNF-Î± over the course of treatment was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, three of the four human leukocyte antigen-A2-positive patients experienced a modest increase in circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells following BRAF(V600) inhibitor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GSK2118436 treatment results in no detectable negative impact on existing systemic immunity or the de novo generation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that future trials combining specific BRAF(V600E) inhibition with immunotherapy should not impair immune response </plain></SENT>
