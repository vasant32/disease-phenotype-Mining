<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,159 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> from December 1998 to December 2007 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The predictive factors for early recurrence postoperatively and the prognostic factors were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1,159 patients, postoperative recurrence was identified in 280 (24.1 %) patients, and 96 (34.3 %) of the 280 patients with recurrence were designed as early recurrence (less than 1 year postoperatively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter, number of retrieved lymph nodes, and lymphovascular invasion were the independent predictors for early recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early recurrence group had a significantly lower overall survival rate than that of the non-early recurrence group for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate for stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> significantly differed between the early and non-early recurred patients (P &lt; 0.001), whereas the rate did not differ between the patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P = 0.364) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, early recurrence was an independent predictor for unfavorable overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, differentiation, N category, and postoperative chemotherapy were the independent predictors for overall survival for the patients with both early and overall recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Poor survival was associated with early postoperative recurrence for patients who underwent curative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of adjuvant chemotherapy prolonged the survival of patients, irrespective of the interval of recurrence </plain></SENT>
