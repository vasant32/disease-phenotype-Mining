<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed the association of serum levels of eight <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> nutrients in relation to risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, using repeated measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data on a subsample of women in the Women's Health Initiative with repeated measurements of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>, α-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi>, β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi>, β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="10362">cryptoxanthin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27547">zeaxanthin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi>, α-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi> and γ-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi> during follow-up were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 5477 women with baseline serum <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> values, 88 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were identified over a median follow-up time of 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> measured at baseline generally showed no association with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, although serum β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> at baseline showed a non-significant inverse association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using the repeated measurements of β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi>, the average of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measurements was inversely associated with risk of both colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>: HRs for highest vs lowest tertile 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.96, and 0.47, 95% CI 0.25-0.88, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No associations were seen with other <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> nutrients in the repeated measure analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, baseline levels of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> nutrients were not associated with risk of colorectal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>; however, using repeated measures, a relatively high serum level of β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> (average of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measurements) was inversely associated with risk of colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
