<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Over the past years, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has been increasing among young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large percentage of these patients live at least 5 years after diagnosis, but it is unknown whether their rate of hospitalizations after this 5-year mark is comparable to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a population-based cohort consisting of 917 young adult survivors diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Ontario from 1992-1999 and 4585 matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multistate model is presented to reflect and compare trends in the hospitalization process among survivors and their matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyses under a multistate model indicate that the risk of a subsequent hospital admission increases as the number of prior hospitalizations increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients who are yet to experience a hospitalization, the rate of admission is 3.47 times higher for YAS than controls (95% CI (2.79, 4.31)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, among patients that have experienced one and two hospitalizations, the relative rate of a subsequent admission decreases to 3.03 (95% CI (2.01, 4.56)) and 1.90 (95% CI (1.19, 3.03)), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Young adult survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have an increased risk of experiencing hospitalizations compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However this relative risk decreases as the number of prior hospitalizations increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multistate approach is able to use information on the timing of hospitalizations and answer questions that standard Poisson and Negative Binomial models are unable to address </plain></SENT>
