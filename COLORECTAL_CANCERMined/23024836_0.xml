<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oncogenic PI3K/AKT signaling suppresses the activity of forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) transcription factor through phosphorylation leading to its nuclear exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling by PI3K or AKT inhibitors results in the translocation of FOXO3a to the nucleus, and is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy for many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The work has important implications for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>, suggests a companion biomarker strategy to enable a personalized medicine approach, and offers an alternative therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to PI3K and AKT inhibitors </plain></SENT>
