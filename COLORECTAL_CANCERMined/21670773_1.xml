<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In 2005, the National Health Service recommended a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening program using biennial fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), followed by total colonoscopy in positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, no studies have been performed to evaluate the impact of a mass-screening <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> campaign on the health system services at the community level in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore assessed the workload generated by the first two biennial rounds of screening program on the activity of hospital services involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis in the Lecco province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Routine data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospital services of our province were collected on activity levels related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis from January 2003 to December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This time span covered the 2 years prior to, as well as the two biennial rounds of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, we focused on the volume of outpatient FOBTs and colonoscopies (both diagnostic and interventional) performed among subjects outside the screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Joinpoint models were used to test whether an apparent change in trend of examination over time was statistically significant in different age cohorts of the population (&lt;50 years, 50-69 years, and ≥70 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The volume of "extra-screening" per-patient/FOBTs and colonoscopies increased significantly over the evaluated periods in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, until year 2008, when a steady trend was beginning; the AAPCs (average of the annual percent changes) values were 5.7, 3.1, and 8.4 for FOBT and 14.6, 13.4, and 16.7 for colonoscopy in the three age cohorts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the increase in both FOBT and colonoscopy demand was maximal in the cohort ≥70 years, where three statistically significant annual percent changes (APCs) were identified (in 2003-2005, 2005-2006, and 2006-2007 APCs were 12.3, 14.9, and 15.9 for FOBT, and 18.7, 36.8, and 25.4 for colonoscopy, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After the implementation of a FOBT-based mass-screening program for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, careful consideration must be given to the significant increase in the workload of hospital services involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis, outside the screening campaign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The extra-work mainly involves gastroenterologists performing colonoscopy, whose activity increased over the 5-year period by 118%, as well as laboratory services, where the demand of FOBTs rose by 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon, mainly attributable to a profound change in the attitude toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening by those age cohorts outside the program, covers a time span of two full rounds of screening, whereupon a steady trend for colonoscopy is apparent </plain></SENT>
