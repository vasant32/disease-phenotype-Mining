<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Many lesions previously classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> and therefore thought to be innocuous have been reclassified as sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (SSA/Ps), establishing their place in the serrated pathway and underscoring their malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of this new nomenclature is incompletely defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the incidence and characteristics of colorectal SSA/Ps and describes other associated colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A single institution pathology database was searched for the diagnosis of SSA/Ps between January 2004 and October 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SSA/Ps found by colonoscopy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, SSA/P characteristics and associated colonoscopic findings were retrospectively recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 585 SSA/Ps were removed during 519 colonoscopies in 483 patients performed by 64 different endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This represented an overall incidence of SSA/Ps per colonoscopy of 2.1% in the 28,054 colonoscopies performed during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median SSA/P size was 0.8 cm (range 0.2-4.5) and 188 (69%) were â‰¥ 1.0 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 585 SSA/Ps, 366 (63%) were right-sided, 129 (22%) were in the left colon and 90 (15%) were in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, 439 synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of other histology (mainly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath>) were found during the same 519 colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SSA/Ps are rare lesions found during colonoscopy that may coexist with small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because SSA/Ps are part of the serrated oncogenic pathway, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, even those appearing to be hyperplastic, should be removed or biopsied for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Careful review of historical lesions with application of new definitions may redefine risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
