<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we assessed the predictive role of vascular density (VD) in patients treated in the above trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin-embedded materials from 141 patients were analysed with immunohistochemistry for the expression of the CD31 (pan-endothelial cell marker) and of phosphorylated pVEGFR2/KDR on endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VD was correlated with response to therapy and with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant association of pVEGFR2/KDR+ VD with poor response in the placebo group was noted (response rates (RRs) 15% (3/20) when high VD vs 52% (26/50) when low VD; P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RR increased from 15 (3/20) to 50% (11/22) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with high VD when vatalanib was added to chemotherapy (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly improved PFS was noted in patients with high pVEGFR2/KDR+ VD when treated with vatalanib (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was also noted in patients with high CD31+ VD (P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was marginally improved (P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Assessment of the activated vessel density may allow the stratification of patients recruited in randomised trials with VEGFR-targeting anti-angiogenic agents, unmasking their therapeutic potential and enabling their introduction in the clinical practice for the benefit of specific patient subgroups, at the same time reducing the cost of therapy </plain></SENT>
