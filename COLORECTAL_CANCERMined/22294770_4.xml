<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near 157 DNA repair genes in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) GWAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although no individual SNP showed evidence of association, the set of SNPs as a whole was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When candidate SNPs were examined, our data did not support most of the previously reported associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility, an exception being an effect of the MLH1 promoter SNP -93G&gt;A (rs1800734) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rare variants in CHEK2 (I157T and possibly del1100C) also appear to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the absence to date of disease-associated DNA repair SNPs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> GWAS may be explained by a combination of the following: (i) many loci with individually very small effects on risk; (ii) rare alleles of moderate effect and (iii) subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, such as those with microsatellite instability, associated with specific variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It will be particularly intriguing to determine whether any GWAS across <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types identify DNA variants that predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of more than one site </plain></SENT>
