<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Previous clinical studies have indicated that natural IgM antibodies have the ability to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells but IgE and IgA may also mediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell killing (in addition to IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to analyse induction of IgM, IgA and IgE antibodies in patients vaccinated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> associated antigen CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients without macroscopic disease were immunized seven times with CEA ± GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four different dose schedules were used over a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgM, IgA and IgE antibody responses against recombinant CEA were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored immunologically for 36 months and clinically for 147 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GM-CSF significantly augmented the anti-CEA response for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three antibody classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low dose of CEA tended to induce a higher IgM, IgA or IgE anti-CEA antibody response than higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-CEA IgA antibodies could lyse CEA positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as well as in complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between survival and high IgA anti-CEA titers was noted (p = 0.02) irrespective of GM-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observation that IgA anti-CEA antibodies were cytotoxic and associated with improved survival might indicate that also these antibodies may exert a clinical anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
