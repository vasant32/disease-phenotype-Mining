<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of having a stoma on body image in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and to determine whether disturbances in body image predicted distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective analysis of 79 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed within 9 weeks of surgery and followed up at the end of adjuvant treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0558116" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Body image disturbance</z:e>, depressive symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and general distress were measured at baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who received stomas had poorer body image, which worsened over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there were no differences between stoma groups on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> or depressive symptoms, those with a late stoma were most depressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body image was a strong predictor of initial levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and distress and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that stomas negatively impact on the body image of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, those whose body image is most disturbed are at risk for experiencing more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the importance of assessing and treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0558116" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">body image disturbance</z:e> in colorectal patients who receive a stoma </plain></SENT>
