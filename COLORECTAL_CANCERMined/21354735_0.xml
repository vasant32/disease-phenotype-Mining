<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 78 subjects who underwent CTC for screening (n=58) or staging (n=20) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 38 of them (49%) after an incomplete optical colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were administered a mild <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> and a iodinated contrast material for fecal tagging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We scored both the bowel preparation and the overall colon distension as poor, good, or optimal and measured the mean sigmoid colon diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We counted the number of diverticula and classified patients as having or not a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341356" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe diverticular disease</z:e> (SDD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of the prompts of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) per patient was also considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mann-Whitney U and Ï‡(2) tests were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No CTC complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The bowel cleansing was poor in 8 (10%) patients, good in 29 (37%) and optimal in 41 (53%); colon distension was poor in 7 (9%) patients, good in 38 (49%), and optimal in 33 (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four (69%) showed diverticula and 30 (38%) had an SDD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bowel cleansing and distension were not significantly impaired by neither diverticula (p&gt;0.590) nor the SDD (p&gt;0.110) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean sigmoid colon diameter was reduced in presence of diverticula (28 mm versus 23 mm, p=0.009) or SDD (26 mm versus 22 mm, p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean number of CAD prompts per patient was not significantly increased by the presence of SDD (p=0.829) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bowel cleansing and distension at CTC were not influenced by the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
