<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 50 patients with far advanced or recurrent unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment in our hospital between June 2005 and November 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven clinical variables and 7 laboratory indices before chemotherapy were evaluated retrospectively as the possible prognostic factors of overall and progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 27 patients (54%) died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated NLR (â‰¥4.0) was observed in 15 patients (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, elevated NLR, performance status and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminemia</z:hpo> were significantly associated with both poor overall and progression-free survivals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that elevated NLR (hazard ratio 4.39, 95% confidence interval 1.82-10.7; p = 0.0013) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 5.02, 95% confidence interval 1.69-13.4; p = 0.0066) were independently associated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated NLR is a powerful predictor of poor response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in patients with unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ratio is a simply accessible and inexpensive but useful biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
