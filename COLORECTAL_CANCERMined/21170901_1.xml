<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (CRCS) in the United States is inadequate in minority communities and particularly among those who lack insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Finding ways to increase screenings in these minorities presents a healthcare challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to determine whether offering CRCS at the time of mammography is an effective way to increase CRCS among minority women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was offered to women attending the Breast Examination Center of Harlem (BECH), a community outreach program of Memorial Sloan-Kettering serving the primarily black and Hispanic Harlem Community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening was explained, medical fitness was determined, and colonoscopies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Barriers to screening and ways to overcome them were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants had to be at least 50 years of age without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or screening within the last 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2616 women eligible for CRCS, of these women 2005 (77%) refused to participate in the study, and 611 (23%) women were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a high interest in CRCS including among those who declined to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major barrier was lack of medical insurance, which was partially overcome by alternative funding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 611 women enrolled, 337 (55%) went on to have screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (15%) women had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Offering CRCS to minority women at the time of mammography and without a physician's referral is an effective way to expand screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Screening colonoscopy findings are similar to those in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Alternatives to traditional medical insurance are needed for the uninsured </plain></SENT>
