<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explores interest in genetic testing for hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who have never received genetic counseling or testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using results from a cross-sectional survey of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (n=91) at varying categories of risk for hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to compare positive and negative attitudinal beliefs regarding genetic testing, risk perceptions, demographics, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage of those who were interested in genetic testing (n=61) and those who were not interested or were not sure (n=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although significant at the bivariate level, gender, perceived relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary cancer</z:e>, employment status, and belief that genetic testing would help in preparing for the future were not significantly related to interest in genetic testing when controlling for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other variables in a logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two factors that remained significant include a single-item question measuring the belief that genetic testing is warranted based on personal/family history and a positive attitudinal scale regarding the utility of genetic testing in medical decision making and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results have potential implications for policies regarding universal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> screening for LS </plain></SENT>
