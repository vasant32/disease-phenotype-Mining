<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some patients happen to have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with microsatellite instability (MSI), but without any alteration in Mismatch Repair (MMR) system (germline mutation/promoter methylation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify the mechanism of inactivation of MMR genes in those cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 18 patients with MSI CCR and loss of expression of a MMR protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from tumoral and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the 3 main MMR genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, by sequencing and large rearrangement analysis, and looked for mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients lost expression of MLH1, we found 1 mutation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> for 3 patients and 2 mutations in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients lost expression of MSH2: we found 1 mutation in 2 patients and 2 mutations in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 5 cases with 2 hits, MSI was due to double somatic hits (n = 3), mosaicism (n = 1) and missed germline mutation (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism was confirmed by HRM analysis, and by finding a germline mutation in one patient's son </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We could explain MSI in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of 5 patients (27.8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their follow up and family's surveillance could be adjusted, as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases don't require intensive surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We describe the first case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> after de novo mutation in MSH2 </plain></SENT>
