<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, enumeration of gene copies is challenging and the lack of analytical standardisation has limited incorporation of the test into the clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed EGFR FISH interlaboratory consensus among five molecular diagnostic reference centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A set of 12 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples circulated among laboratories, and samples were scored according to commonly agreed guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility was quantified using the standard error of measurement (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> of 0.865 and a within-subject coefficient of variation (WSCV) of 26.8% for mean EGFR gene/nuclei and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> of 0.235 and a WSCV of 19.4% for the mean EGFR gene/CEP7 ratio were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the fraction of cells displaying chromosome 7 polysomy showed WSCV of 46.6%, 34.0% and 51.0% for percentage of cells displaying ≤2, ≥3 and ≥4 EGFR signals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among different slides of the same specimen, the WSCV was 6.1% for mean EGFR gene/nuclei and 3.9% for mean of EGFR gene/CEP7 ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Molecular diagnosis of EGFR gene copy number by FISH varied largely among pathology centres, with fluctuations covering the whole range of proposed cut-offs of predictive usefulness from literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Definition of a detailed scoring system and implementation of comprehensive training programmes for laboratories are therefore necessary before including the test into clinical practice </plain></SENT>
