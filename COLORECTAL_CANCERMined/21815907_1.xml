<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of iNKT cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the physiological role of iNKT cells in a mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> model </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surface markers of mononuclear cells from the liver and the colon were assessed by FACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-13 from the colon were measured by ELISA. α-galactosylceramide (GC), or its close analog OCH, was administered intraperitoneally on the first day of each cycle of DSS-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the AOM/DSS model, hepatic iNKT cells were significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
