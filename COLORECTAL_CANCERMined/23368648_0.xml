<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on specific and 10-year survival are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes overall and disease-specific survival for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and assesses the value of clinical factors on disease-specific survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: a retrospective cohort study of newly diagnosed invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases diagnosed from 1992 to 2007 were identified through the Hospital del Mar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five-and 10-year survival functions were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: a total of 2,080 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis was 72 years and 58.5%were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By the end of the follow-up period (December 2008), 1,225 patients had died and 68.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5- and 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival rates were 55.5% (95%CI 53.9-57.9%) and 48.5% (95%CI 45.6-51.3%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year specific survival rate improved in the last period (2003-2007) (60.4%, 95%CI 55.4-65.0) compared with 1992-1997(53.4%; 95%CI 49.2-57.4) and 1998-2002 (52.0%; 95%CI 47.8-56.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Various factors were independently associated with excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality: male sex (HR 1.21), age at diagnosis &gt; 75 years(HR 1.97), rectal location (HR 1.33), more advanced stages (stage IV: HR 18.54), poorly differentiated/undifferentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (HR 1.80), and admission through the emergency department (HR 1.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival improved from 1992 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This improvement could be due to more effective treatment, since changes in stage distribution or age at diagnosis were not observed during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rates should notably improve with the implementation of a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening program in Spain </plain></SENT>
