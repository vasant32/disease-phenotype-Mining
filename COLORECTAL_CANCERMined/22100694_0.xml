<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a historic cohort of 202 breast and 218 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> treated with targeted agents from 1998 to 2009, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test to estimate survival through tertiles of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis stratified by primary site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and including gender, age and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up was 20 months (1-128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 60 months, 65% of patients in the lowest tertile of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not experiment disease progression compared with 34% in the highest tertile (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six percent of females in the lowest tertile showed no progression compared with 49% in the top tertiles (P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was a significant predictor of time to disease progression only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients in the first tertile compared with the third (P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of a predictive role of pretreatment fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the development of resistance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients treated with targeted agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are warranted to confirm our findings </plain></SENT>
