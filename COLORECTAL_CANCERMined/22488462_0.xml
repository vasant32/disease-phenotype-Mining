<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, efforts to prevent these diseases among asymptomatic people at high familial risk are justified to reduce the health burden of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 2006-2009 Oregon Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to examine associations between family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (BC), and: (1) patient-reported clinician recommendations, (2) adoption of preventive and screening behaviors, and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease risk factors among respondents without a personal history of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A positive family history was associated with a higher likelihood of reported discussion by clinicians of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and BC screening and a greater likelihood of respondents having cholesterol and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of family history and clinician recommendations significantly increased the odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and BC screening compared to family history alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive family history was also associated with respondents reporting lifestyle changes to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but not BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Awareness of family history prompts clinicians to recommend screening and may motivate patients to be screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Understanding positive family history may also motivate patients to adopt healthy lifestyles </plain></SENT>
