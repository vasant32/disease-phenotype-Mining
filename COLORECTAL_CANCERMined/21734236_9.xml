<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that human BM cells can be treated in vitro with defined growth factors to induce the rapid generation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), hereafter defined as BM-MDSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, combination of G-CSF + GM-CSF led to the development of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> mixture of immature myeloid cells ranging from myeloblasts to band cells that were able to suppress alloantigen- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we further investigate the mechanism of suppression and define the cell subset that is fully responsible for BM-MDSC-mediated immune suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This population, which displays the structure and markers of promyelocytes, is however distinct from physiologic promyelocytes that, instead, are devoid of immuosuppressive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate that promyelocyte-like cells proliferate in the presence of activated lymphocytes and that, when these cells exert suppressive activity, they do not differentiate but rather maintain their immature phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that promyelocyte-like BM-MDSCs are equivalent to MDSCs present in the blood of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and that increased circulating levels of these immunosuppressive myeloid cells correlate with worse prognosis and radiographic progression </plain></SENT>
