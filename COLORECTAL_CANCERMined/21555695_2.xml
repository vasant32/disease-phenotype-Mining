<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: New editions of the TNM staging system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have been subject to extensive criticism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we evaluate each edition of TNM and analyze stage migration caused by the different versions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two independent test populations were used: participants derived from a randomized surgical trial from the United Kingdom (n = 455) and patients from a population-based series from Sweden (n = 505) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> slides from these patient cases were reviewed with special attention for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> deposits were classified according to the fifth, sixth, and seventh editions of TNM and correlated with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Every change in edition of TNM led to a stage migration of between 33% and 64% in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility was best in the fifth edition of TNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of the seventh edition was best only when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> deposits irrespective of size or contour were included as lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of the fifth edition was better than that of the sixth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrate there is a place for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> deposits in the staging of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, many questions remain about their definition and the reproducibility and use of this category in special situations, such as after neoadjuvant treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These should be the subject of additional research before use as a factor in TNM staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates the necessity of testing modifications before their introduction </plain></SENT>
