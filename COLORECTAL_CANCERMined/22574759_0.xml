<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective  To understand cues and barriers to people's engagement in self-management during chemotherapy treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design  Secondary analysis of qualitative data from mixed methods, longitudinal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Setting and participants  Eleven participants undergoing treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semi-structured interviews were conducted twice with each participant, at the start and end of a 6-month course of chemotherapy treatment in a Scottish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results  Cues and barriers to engagement in self-management appeared to stem from perceptions of the impact and associated severity of side effects experiences as well as the perceptions about the efficacy of chosen self-management activities and perceptions of control in minimizing the consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe, episodic or unexpected side effects coupled with perceptions of uncertainty, lack of control and lack of adequate preparation to engage in self-management were identified as key barriers to engagement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discussion and conclusion  Participants' reflection on, or appraisal of, their treatment-related experiences and personal abilities, confidence and preferences to manage the impact of these shaped their subsequent engagement in self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings highlight the importance of understanding individual's self-management experiences, perceptions, preferences, priorities and needs to help support, prepare and enable them to feel capable and confident to engage actively and effectively in self-management </plain></SENT>
