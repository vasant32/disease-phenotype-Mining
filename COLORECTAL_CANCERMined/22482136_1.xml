<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this pilot study was to assess acceptability of a take-home fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and the effect of follow-up telephone counseling for increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in rural Appalachia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a prospective, single-group, multiple-site design, with centralized laboratory reports of screening adherence and baseline and 3-month questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successive patients, aged 50 or older, at average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk and due for screening were enrolled during a routine visit to 3 primary care practices in rural Appalachian Pennsylvania and received a free take-home FIT and educational brochure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those who had not returned the test 2 weeks later were referred for telephone counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 232 patients approached, 200 (86.2%) agreed to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 145 (72.5%) completed the FIT as recommended (adherent) and 55 (27.5%) were referred for telephone counseling (nonadherent), of whom 23 (41.8%) became adherent after 1 to 2 counseling sessions, an 11.5 percentage-point increase in screening after telephone counseling and 84% FIT adherence overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related knowledge and perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were the screening barriers most highly associated with nonadherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significant, the rate of conversion to screening adherence was higher among participants who received telephone counseling compared to an answering machine reminder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If confirmed in future randomized trials, provider-recommended take-home FIT and follow-up telephone counseling may be methods to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in Appalachia </plain></SENT>
