<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 84 patients with unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in whom first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>- based chemotherapy was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome of treatment was analyzed in relation to the KI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were classified into 3 groups: high risk group (n=12), intermediate risk group (n=20), and low risk group (n=52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to response rate, disease control rate, disease-free survival, overall survival, and the rate of conversion to hepatic metastatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that KI might not be useful for predicting the efficacy of first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy for unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
