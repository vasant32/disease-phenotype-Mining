<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our aim is to demonstrate the usefulness of PDE observation for hepatic resection in patients with LM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Between February and October 2009, seven patients who underwent hepatic resection for LM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After previous ICG injection (0.1mg/kg/mL), PDE observation was performed to detect fine invisible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumors</z:e> on the surface of the resected liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 46 resected LM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> that had been pointed out preoperatively were easily detected by their fluorescence using PDE observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the seven patients underwent additional partial resection because fine invisible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumors</z:e> were detected by their fluorescence using PDE observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients who underwent additional resection had no recurrence of LMCRC on the surface of the resected liver after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PDE observation is useful for detecting fine invisible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumors</z:e> that cannot be revealed under visible light during hepatic resection in patients with LM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and may reduce the incidence of local recurrence on the superficial parenchyma of the liver </plain></SENT>
