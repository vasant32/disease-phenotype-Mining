<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Results from short-term studies of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> type 2 (H2) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> on survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> are debatable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the efficacy of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37961">H2-receptor antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> on long-term survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients scheduled for elective resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> were consecutively included in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study designed to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before skin incision <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> 100 mg or placebo was given intravenously twice daily followed by oral <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> 150 mg or placebo twice daily for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant cytotoxic or radiation therapy was not given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An observer-blinded interim analysis performed after 40 months showed that there was no effect of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> on overall survival, and the study was discontinued in accordance with the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient cohort has been followed continuously without loss of any patient, and a final statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis after more than 5 years; this included a subgroup analysis of perioperative blood transfusion and postoperative infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median observation period of the 740 patients included was 6.8 (range 5.4-7.9) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A univariate analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 740 patients and of the subgroup of 560 who underwent curative resection showed no significant effect of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> had no survival benefit in curatively resected patients who received a perioperative blood transfusion (n = 358), but it improved the survival of non-transfused patients (n = 202; hazard ratio (HR) 0.6 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 0.4 to 0.9), P = 0.02) and of non-transfused patients who did not develop postoperative infectious complications (n = 170; HR 0.6 (95 per cent c.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>0.4 to 0.9), P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis of patients who had a curative resection, including Dukes' stage, age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, blood transfusion, postoperative infectious complications and treatment, <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> still had an independent, beneficial effect on survival (HR 0.6 (95 per cent c.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>0.4 to 1.0), P = 0.04) within the subgroup of patients who did not receive perioperative blood transfusion and did not develop postoperative infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">Ranitidine</z:chebi> may prolong the survival of patients who undergo curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and who do not receive perioperative blood transfusion and do not develop postoperative infectious complications </plain></SENT>
