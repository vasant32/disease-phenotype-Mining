<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While colonic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> metabolism mediated by eukaryotic cells is relatively well studied, much less is known about <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> metabolism within gastrointestinal microbes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sulfated compounds in the colon are either of inorganic (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26820,35175">sulfates</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17359">sulfites</z:chebi>) or organic (e.g., dietary amino acids and host mucins) origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most extensively studied of the microbes involved in colonic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> metabolism are the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>-reducing bacteria (SRB), which are common colonic inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many other microbial pathways are likely to shape colonic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> metabolism as well as the composition and availability of sulfated compounds, and these interactions need to be examined in more detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16136">Hydrogen sulfide</z:chebi> is the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> derivative that has attracted the most attention in the context of colonic health, and the extent to which it is detrimental or beneficial remains in debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence point to SRB or exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16136">hydrogen sulfide</z:chebi> as potential players in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disorders</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBDs) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in particular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16136">hydrogen sulfide</z:chebi> via pathways other than dissimilatory <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> reduction may be as, or more, important than those involving the SRB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest here that a novel axis of research is to assess the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16136">hydrogen sulfide</z:chebi> in shaping colonic microbiome structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clearly, in-depth characterization of the microbial pathways involved in colonic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> metabolism is necessary for a better understanding of its contribution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disorders</z:e> and development of therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
