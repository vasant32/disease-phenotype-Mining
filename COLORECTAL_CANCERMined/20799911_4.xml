<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective, population based study was performed to validate this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Individuals (n = 4509) referred for large bowel endoscopy due to symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline data and concurrent diseases were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and findings at examinations were recorded using International Classification of Diseases-10 codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma was obtained before endoscopy and TIMP-1 and CEA levels were determined after the inclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings were based on sigmoidoscopy in 1766 and colonoscopy in 2743 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon cancer</z:hpo> (CC) was detected in 184 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in 110 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten individuals with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, 856 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 1176 with non-neoplastic findings were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The biomarker levels were increased in a variety of diseases including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to individuals without any findings at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multivariable analysis demonstrated that both markers were significant and independent detectors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combining both biomarkers, independent contributions from each (TIMP-1, odds ratio (OR) = 1.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4-2.2), p &lt; 0.0001; CEA &lt; 5 ng/ml, OR = 1.6, 1.3-1.9, or ≥ 5 ng/ml, OR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.9-2.7 (p &lt; 0.0001)) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis of individuals examined by colonoscopy with CC as the endpoint showed that combining both biomarkers, independent contributions from each (TIMP-1, OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.8-3.4, p &lt; 0.0001; CEA &lt; 5 ng/ml, OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8, and CEA ≥ 5 ng/ml, OR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.8-3.0 (p &lt; 0.0001)) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This prospective validation study supports the use of the combination of plasma TIMP-1 and CEA protein measurements as a potential aid in early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and specifically of CC </plain></SENT>
