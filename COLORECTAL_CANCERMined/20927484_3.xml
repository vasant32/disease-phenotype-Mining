<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of PLSCR1 protein in 104 matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue sections and 50 pairs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue blocks were determined by use of immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the diagnostic potential of PLSCR1, the plasma levels of PLSCR1 were investigated in 111 additional subjects (59 CRC patients and 52 healthy controls) by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PLSCR1 was overexpressed in malignant <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the plasma level of PLSCR1 was not only significantly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients compared with healthy individuals (P &lt; 0.001), but it was also substantially increased in early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the overall sensitivity and specificity of PLSCR1 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection were 80% and 59.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area under the ROC curve of PLSCR1 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis is 0.75, which increases to 0.8 if combined with the measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis with the Cox regression model revealed that elevated PLSCR1 expression indicated a poor prognosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study showed that PLSCR1 protein levels were significantly elevated in both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue and plasma of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the plasma levels of PLSCR1 were significantly elevated in patients with early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with healthy individuals, suggesting that PLSCR1 might be used as a noninvasive serological diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
