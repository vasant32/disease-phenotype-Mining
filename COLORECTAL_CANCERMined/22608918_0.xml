<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed post-hoc analyses of data from the Alves et al. prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using standard criteria of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, 2 groups were created a posteriori: Well-nourished (WN) and Mal-nourished (MN) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups were statistically adjusted for age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> status, and scheduled surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual costs were valued using the French National Cost Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative morbidity, mortality, hospital length-of-stay (LOS), and discharge setting were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We defined 3 scenarios, the most accurate estimate and its upper and lower limits, to assess the economic impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 453 patients were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complication and mortality rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MN patients had a mean LOS 3.41 days significantly longer than WN patients (p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In MN patients, the cost of hospital stay was increased by around 3360 €, creating an annual impact of 10,159,436 € for French non-profit hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>Malnutrition</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgical patients is associated with an increased LOS resulting in significant budget impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate this impact and the related cost-benefit of perioperative specialized nutritional support and implementation of the ERAS protocol in this homogeneous category of patients </plain></SENT>
