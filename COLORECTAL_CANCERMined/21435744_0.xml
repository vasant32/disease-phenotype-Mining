<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels have been found to be increased in a significant number of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>COX-2 overexpression is linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> due to increased production of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi>, which seem to play an important role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, cell proliferation and migration, as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data support the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>) or aspirin, a COX-2 inhibitor, as an effective agent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several cohort and case control studies have shown that regular use of aspirin reduces the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by approximately 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, randomized controlled trials of aspirin report discrepant results, although there is an decrease in the relative risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence of approximately 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To date, although there is compelling evidence that the use of aspirin protects against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the optimal dose and duration of aspirin required to obtain this effect remain to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Probably, the longer the treatment duration--even for more than 10 years--and possibly with higher doses, the greater the protective effects of aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, these benefits need to be considered in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the health effects of prolonged aspirin use, both positive and negative </plain></SENT>
