<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bulk of evidence is derived from single surgical series, hampering any definitive conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with LM submitted to surgery with those who were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 409 patients with LM as the first evidence of advanced disease were extracted from a database of 1,411 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups: G1, comprised of 155 patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>; G2, comprised of 104 patients with LM only and no surgery; G3, comprised of 50 patients with LM only and submitted to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference in response rates emerged between G1 and G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival (PFS) times were: 10.3 months, 10.5 months, and 26.2 months for G1, G2, and G3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference in PFS times was observed between G1 and G2, whereas there was a statistically significant difference between G2 and G3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival times were 24.2 months, 31.5 months, and 72.4 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival times were longer in resected patients: 17 survived &gt;5 years and three survived &gt;10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with LM only and no surgery, four survived for 5 years and none survived &gt;10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even though patients with resectable LM are more likely to be those with a better outcome, our study provides evidence suggesting an active role of surgery in improving survival outcomes in this patient subset </plain></SENT>
