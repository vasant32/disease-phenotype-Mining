<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis examined the association between efficacy and safety of the fully human anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody panitumumab and KRAS mutation status in Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients using data from two clinical trials with adherence to good clinical practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An exploratory, integrated analysis of data from KRAS evaluable patients enrolled in a Phase 1 study (Study 20040192) and a Phase 2 study (Study 20050216) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples were analyzed for KRAS status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy endpoint of this analysis was objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response per modified response evaluation criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>; a key secondary endpoint was progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Safety endpoints included incidence of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> samples with known KRAS status were available from 8 of 13 (62%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in the Phase 1 study and 16 of 53 patients (30%) in the Phase 2 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 14 (58%) patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and 10 (42%) patients had mutated KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four (17%) patients had a partial response; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responders had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> secondary efficacy endpoints also favored patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related adverse events were predominantly mild to moderate and skin related, and were similar between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutated KRAS in this small patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutated KRAS status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> is associated with lack of response to panitumumab therapy </plain></SENT>
