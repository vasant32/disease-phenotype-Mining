<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two unsupervised cluster analyses revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> form three distinct DNA methylation subsets, which are referred to as the high-, intermediate-, and low-methylation epigenotypes (HME, IME, and LME, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recent study by Yagi et al. found a fairly sensitive and specific identification of HME, IME, and LME using two marker panels analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MassARRAY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the expensive equipment required for this method substantially increases the cost and complexity of the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this article, we demonstrate the assessment of HME, IME, and LME in a group of 233 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> using seven markers proposed by Yagi et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DNA methylation of each marker was quantified using combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> restriction analysis (COBRA) and analyzed along with various genetic factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> [the BRAF and KRAS mutations, MLH1 methylation and microsatellite instability (MSI)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The baseline methylation of each marker was generated from pooled DNA isolated from 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the correlation of HME, IME, and LME epigenotyped by COBRA using different molecular classifiers is similar to that achieved by MassARRAY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, epigenotyping <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> using COBRA is a simple, specific, and cost-effective method that has the potential to be widely used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> research </plain></SENT>
