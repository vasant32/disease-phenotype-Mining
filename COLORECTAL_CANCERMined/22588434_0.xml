<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many Muslim <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients witness the fasting month of Ramadan but we do not know which individuals elect to fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study conducted among Muslim <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (NCI), Egypt, during Ramadan, Hijri 1430 (the month of fasting) August-September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One-hundred and two patients being treated at the NCI were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (31%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (24%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (7%), non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> (4%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012118'>laryngeal cancer</z:hpo> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two sexes were equally represented and so were metastatic and nonmetastatic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outpatient:inpatient ratio was 3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatments being received by these patients included chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, and nonspecific therapy in 42%, 31%, 10%, and 17%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other concomitant diseases were present in 22% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While 40% of patients did not fast at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> during Ramadan, 36% and 24% were partial and complete fasters, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Female patients, those with performance status (PS) 0 to 1, those whose disease was a nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e>, and those receiving non-intravenous chemotherapy as outpatients were more likely to be fasting than their corresponding counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Being a female, having PS 0 to 1, and receiving treatment as an outpatient were the only factors that were significant on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 46% of patients sought the treating oncologist advice on whether they could fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients fast during Ramadan, but only half of them discuss the issue with their oncologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We hope that our study stimulates more research on this topic </plain></SENT>
