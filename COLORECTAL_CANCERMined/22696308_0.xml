<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that SAC has a poorer prognosis and has different molecular and immunohistochemical features compared with conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (CC) but, to date, only one previous study has analyzed its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression profile by microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a different microarray platform, we have studied the molecular signature of 11 SACs and compared it with that of 15 matched CC with the aim of discerning the functions which characterize SAC biology and validating, at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level, the most differentially expressed genes which were also tested using a validation set of 70 SACs and 70 CCs to assess their diagnostic and prognostic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microarray data showed a higher representation of morphogenesis-, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-, cytoskeleton- and vesicle transport-related functions and also an overexpression of fascin1 (actin-bundling protein associated with invasion) and the antiapoptotic gene hippocalcin in SAC <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were validated both by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fascin1 expression was statistically associated with KRAS mutation with 88.6% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity for SAC diagnosis and the positivity of fascin1 or hippocalcin was highly suggestive of SAC diagnosis (sensitivity = 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of these markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> showing histological and molecular characteristics of high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) also helped to distinguish SACs from MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular profiling demonstrates that SAC shows activation of distinct signaling pathways and that immunohistochemical fascin1 and hippocalcin expression can be reliably used for its differentiation from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
