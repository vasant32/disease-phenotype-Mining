<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify genes associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we investigated gene expression levels within a series of young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> who are not known to carry any hereditary syndromes (n=24; mean 43 years at diagnosis), and compared this with a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> from patients diagnosed at an older age (n=17; mean 79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two individual genes were found to be differentially expressed between the two groups, with statistical significance; CLC was higher and IFNAR1 was less expressed in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, genes located at chromosome band 19q13 were found to be enriched significantly among the genes with higher expression in the early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> samples, including CLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An elevated immune content within the early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group was observed from the differentially expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By application of outlier statistics, H3F3A was identified as a top candidate gene for a subset of the early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
