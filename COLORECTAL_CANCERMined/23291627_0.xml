<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> has the potential to develop into a novel therapeutic strategy for various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are inexpensive, stable and easier to handle compared to lasers, have been used in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> as a light source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), the efficacy of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in combination with LEDs has not been fully assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the antitumor effect of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> using various LEDs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HT-29 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line was used both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HT-29 cells were seeded in 96-well plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following 5-ALA administration, cells were irradiated using LEDs at different wavelengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three types of LEDs, blue (peak wavelength, 456 nm), white (broad-band) and red (635 nm) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after irradiation, the cytotoxic effects of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> were measured using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the antitumor effect of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in vivo, <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice were inoculated with HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Xenograft mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5-ALA and irradiated with 3 types of LEDs at a measured fluence rate of 96 mW/cm2 and fluence of 32 J/cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Each group comprised 6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was repeated 3 times at weekly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> weights were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Compared to the controls, ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> using LEDs showed significant antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The blue and white LEDs demonstrated greater antitumor effects compared to the red LEDs in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> inhibition rates in the blue and white LED groups were approximately 88% to those of the control group in the mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> using LEDs is effective and useful in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This method could be a novel treatment modality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
