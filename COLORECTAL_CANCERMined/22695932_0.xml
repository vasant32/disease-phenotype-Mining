<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The influence of body mass index (BMI) on the outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is largely unknown, particularly in an Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the influence of BMI on survival of patients who underwent surgical treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective cohort study included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who underwent surgery between June 2003 and May 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study participants were divided into two BMI groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (&lt;23 kg/m(2)) and overweight (≥23 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 509 CRC patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 318 patients (62.5%) were male, and the mean ± SD age was 59.1 ± 11.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two hundred eighteen patients (42.8%) were included in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight group and 291 (57.2%) were included in the overweight group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of 62.8 ± 27.2 months, 100 (19.6%) of the 509 eligible patients died, and 72 (15.0%) of 479 experienced recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of overweight group was more favorable compared with that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight group (P = 0.001), while there was no significant difference in recurrence (P = 0.735) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight group, the hazard ratios of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and recurrence, respectively, were 0.615 (95% confidence interval 0.408-925; P = 0.020) and 0.992 (95% confidence interval 0.613-1.604; P = 0.973) for the overweight group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overweight is not associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> but rather is associated a favorable overall survival in Asian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients undergoing surgery </plain></SENT>
