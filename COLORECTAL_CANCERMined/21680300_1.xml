<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 90% of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, telomere length is maintained by the expression and activation of telomerase reverse transcriptase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various studies have demonstrated an increase in telomerase activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue, which suggests its possible prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main objective of our study was to study the prognostic value of the expression level of telomerase catalytic component (hTERT) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed the prognostic value of the ratio of telomerase expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue to telomerase expression in the adjacent healthy mucosa and the prognostic value of the expression level of hTERT in the serum of patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As secondary objectives of the study, we (1) analysed the correlation between telomerase expression in the serum and that in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue and (2) analysed the relationship between telomerase expression and different clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peripheral blood and tissue samples taken from 48 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival time (OST) between the groups of patients categorised based on the ratio of telomerase expression between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue and healthy tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation index (Pearson's coefficient) between telomerase levels in the serum and those in tissue was 0.32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study of the relationship between telomerase levels in the serum and different clinical variables, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size, ganglion affectation, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels and stage, revealed a higher telomerase expression level in patients with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between telomerase expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue and the clinical parameters analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in our study do not allow us to propose that the level of telomerase expression be used as a prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, we cannot consider telomerase expression in the serum as a surrogate marker of its expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
