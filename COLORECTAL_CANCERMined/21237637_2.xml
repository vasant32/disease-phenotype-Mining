<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent to which differences in management can explain this is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Record-linkage between two Swedish Regional Clinical Quality Registers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and a socio-economic database generated a dataset with information on diagnostic procedures, treatment and survival in patients of different educational background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients from the years 1995 to 2006 and 5715 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients from 1997 to 2006 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with high education, those with shorter education had poorer relative and overall survival (57.9% 5-year relative survival versus 63.8% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, 58.7% versus 69.1% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were also differences in diagnostic activity with preoperative computer tomography (40% versus 47.3%) and colonoscopy (56.3% versus 62.8%) being more frequent in highly educated groups (p=0.001 and 0.037, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery resulting in colostomy was performed in 26.9% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients of high education compared to 35.5% of those with low education (p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> has poorer prognosis than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, it was noted that among the highly educated, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients had better survival than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients (69.1% versus 63.8% 5-year relative survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It thus appears that improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> management has benefited mainly patients of middle and higher educational levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that socioeconomic differences exist in diagnostic activity and management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, which may affect survival </plain></SENT>
