<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one paraffin-embeded specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MALDI-TOF-MS and regular sequencing were used to test the mutation of codon 12 and 13 in K-ras exon 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 47 specimens could be detected successfully in regular sequencing, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the specimens were tested successfully in MALDI-TOF-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen specimens had K-ras mutation in regular sequencing(30.0%), while 22 specimens had mutation in MALDI-TOF-MS(36.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six specimens with mutation were found in MALDI-TOF-MS but were <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> in regular sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Same mutation types from 14 specimens were confirmed by both regular sequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MALDI-TOF-MS was able to detect the mutation in 2 specimens that was not identified in regular sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MALDI-TOF-MS is a feasible approach of K-ras gene mutation testing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, which is less demanding in terms of specimen quality and is more sensitive as compared to regular sequencing </plain></SENT>
