<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APC mutations result in truncated products that have primarily lost the ability to properly regulate the level of the transcription factor Î²-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells from FAP patients always retain a truncated APC product and the reasons for this strong selective pressure are not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe here the surprising property for the transcriptional repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) to promote the oligomerization of truncated APC through binding to the 15 amino acid repeats of truncated APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CtBP can bind to either first, third or fourth 15 amino acid repeats, but not to the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CtBP-mediated oligomerization requires both dimerization domains of truncated APC as well as CtBP dimerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the position of the mutations along the APC sequence in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> from FAP patients reveals that the presence of the first 15 amino acid repeat is almost always selected in the resulting truncated APC product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the sensitivity of truncated APC to oligomerization by CtBP constitutes an essential facet of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
