<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This gives high public health priority to mass screening using a noninvasive, fecal occult blood test of asymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A positive test selects those who should undergo colonoscopy to ensure early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Guaiac fecal occult blood test has low sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Automated immunochemical tests that measure the fecal human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration are more sensitive and can be simplified as a 1- to 3-sample format with optimum cutoff points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to improve the sensitivity of the test by choosing an accurate format (1- to 3-sample and optimum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration) while maintaining acceptable specificity and avoiding alteration of the screening program in terms of quality of life and economic outputs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a screening program for a population of 100,000 asymptomatic individuals by use of immunological fecal tests with different cutoffs, leading to different sensitivity/specificity ratios, and to compare its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared with the guaiac fecal test program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results suggest that a 3-sample immunological test with 50 ng/mL as a positive cutoff is cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It provides more asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection without significantly increasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This format should be prospectively evaluated in mass screening </plain></SENT>
