<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the response of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) to 5-FU-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed a population-based cohort of 302 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) for a median follow-up time of 50.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CIMP status was determined by analysis of the CACNAG1, SOCS1, RUNX3, NEUROG1, and MLH1 promoters; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were considered to be CIMP positive if at least 3 promoters were methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> from 29.5% of patients (89/302) were CIMP positive; CIMP status did not influence disease-free survival (DFS; log-rank = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of TNM stages II-III (n = 196), 32.7% were CIMP positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with stages II-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who did not receive adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy, those with CIMP-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had longest times of DFS (log-rank = 0.04); In patients who received chemotherapy, those with CIMP-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had shorter times of DFS (log-rank = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with CIMP-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy significantly increased time of DFS (log-rank = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with CIMP-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy did not affect time of DFS (log-rank = 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed a significant, independent interaction between 5-FU treatment and CIMP status (hazard ratio [HR], 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among patients with CIMP-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, adjuvant chemotherapy was not an independent predictor of outcome (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3-2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients who did not receive adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy, CIMP status was the only independent predictor of survival (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CIMP-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> do not benefit from 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
