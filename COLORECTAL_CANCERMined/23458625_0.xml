<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination of a standard proteomics approach (1D-gel electrophoresis coupled to LC/ion trap mass spectrometry) and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq allowed us to exploit the greater depth of the transcriptomics measurement (∼9800 transcripts per cell line) versus the protein observations (∼1900 protein identifications per cell line) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the proteomics data were helpful in identifying both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> associated proteins with differential expression patterns as well as protein networks and pathways which appear to be deregulated in these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examples of potential markers include mortalin, nucleophosmin, ezrin, LASP1, alpha and beta forms of spectrin, exportin, the carcinoembryonic antigen family, EGFR and MET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interaction analyses identified the large intermediate filament family, the protein folding network and adapter proteins in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> networks, which included the CDC42 and RHOA signaling pathways that may have potential for identifying phenotypic states representing poorly and moderately differentiated states of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
