<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Experimental studies have suggested green tea to be a chemopreventive agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and many studies have examined possible associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the conclusions were inconsistent or even contradictory, so we performed a meta-analysis based on published case-control studies to explore if green tea is indeed a protective factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PubMed was searched up to May 10th, 2012 for relevant studies, and references of included studies were manually searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally 13 eligible studies, involving 12,636 cases and 38,419 controls were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After data extraction, a meta-analysis was performed using CMA v2 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results indicated there may be a weak but not statistically significant reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with high dose of green tea intake (OR=0.95, 95% CI:0.81-1.11, p=0.490.69-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This protective effect was also found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups, except in American and European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis indicated the result to be robust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Publication bias was not detected by either funnel plot or Egger tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis indicate a weak lower tendency for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development with green tea consumption, but available epidemiologic data are insufficient to conclude that green tea may protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
