<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is the most effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> that has metastasized to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly, surgical resection improves survival for selected patients with pulmonary colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the indication for pulmonary metastasectomy is not clear in patients with both hepatic and pulmonary colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated outcomes after pulmonary resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in patients with or without a history of curative hepatic metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 96 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy from March 1999 to November 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to treatment: resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> alone (lung metastasectomy group) or resection of both hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> (liver and lung metastasectomy group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year OS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 61.3 %, and the 5-year DFS was 26.7 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group comparisons showed that the 5-year OS of the lung metastasectomy group was significantly better than that of the liver and lung metastasectomy group (69 vs. 43 %; p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the 5-year DFS rates of the lung metastasectomy group (25.8 %) and liver and lung metastasectomy group (28.0 %) did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was higher after resection of both hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> than after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> alone (79 vs. 45 %; p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Resection of pulmonary colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> may increase survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of liver and lung metastasectomies had a worse prognosis than pulmonary metastasectomy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In selected patients, combined liver and lung metastasectomy can be beneficial and result in acceptable DFS </plain></SENT>
