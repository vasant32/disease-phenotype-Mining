<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 90 patients were randomly divided into two groups: group CF was treated with a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and the folinic acid-fluorouracil-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX4) regimen; and group F was treated with the FOLFOX4 regimen alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohisto chemical analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With regard to short-term efficacy, the response and disease control rates were significantly greater in group CF than group F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A log-rank test showed that the 3-year survival rate was significantly greater in group CF than group F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> to the FOLFOX4 regimen increased the short-term efficacy and the 3-year survival rate, and improved the quality of life of patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antitumour and chemo sensitizing effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> appeared to be independent of COX-2 </plain></SENT>
