<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to predict distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (DM) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients using an ANN model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data of this study were gathered from 1219 registered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients at the Research Center for Gastroenterology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Liver Disease</z:e> of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran (January 2002 and October 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For prediction of DM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, neural network (NN) and logistic regression (LR) models were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, the concordance index (C index) and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were used for comparison of neural network and logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data analysis was performed with R 2.14.1 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The C indices of ANN and LR models for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> data were calculated to be 0.812 and 0.779, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on testing dataset, the AUROC for ANN and LR models were 0.82 and 0.77, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This means that the accuracy of ANN prediction was better than for LR prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ANN model is a suitable method for predicting DM and in that case is suggested as a good classifier that usefulness to treatment goals </plain></SENT>
