<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Several studies showed potential for monitoring response to systemic therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before (18)F-FDG PET can be implemented for response evaluation the repeatability should be known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to assess the magnitude of the changes in standardized uptake value (SUV), volume and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and validate the biological basis of (18)F-FDG PET in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients scheduled for liver metastasectomy underwent two (18)F-FDG PET scans within 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bland-Altman analysis was performed to assess repeatability of SUV(max), SUV(mean), volume and TLG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> were delineated using an adaptive threshold method (PET(SBR)) and a semiautomatic fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian (FLAB) delineation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Coefficient of repeatability of SUV(max) and SUV(mean) were ∼39 and ∼31 %, respectively, independent of the delineation method used and image reconstruction parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, repeatability was worse in recently treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FLAB delineation method improved the repeatability of the volume and TLG measurements compared to PET(SBR), from coefficients of repeatability of over 85 % to 45 % and 57 % for volume and TLG, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression correlated to the SUV(mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vascularity (CD34 expression) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (carbonic anhydrase IX expression) did not correlate with (18)F-FDG PET parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, repeatability of SUV(mean) and SUV(max) was mainly affected by preceding systemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The repeatability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> volume and TLG could be improved using more advanced and robust delineation approaches such as FLAB, which is recommended when (18)F-FDG PET is utilized for volume or TLG measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Improvement of repeatability of PET measurements, for instance by dynamic PET scanning protocols, is probably necessary to effectively use PET for early response monitoring </plain></SENT>
