<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The degree of gene hypermethylation in non-neoplastic colonic mucosa (NNCM) is a potentially important event in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), particularly for the subgroup with a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to use an unbiased and high-throughput approach to evaluate the topography of DNA methylation in the non-neoplastic colonic mucosa (NNCM) surrounding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 61 tissue samples comprising 53 NNCM and 8 tumor samples were obtained from hemicolectomy specimens of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (Cases 1 and 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NNCM was stripped from the underlying colonic wall and samples taken at varying distances from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of DNA methylation in NNCM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues was assessed at 1,505 CpG sites in 807 cancer-related genes using Illumina GoldenGate® methylation arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 1 tumor showed significantly higher levels of methylation compared to surrounding NNCM samples (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average level of methylation in NNCM decreased with increasing distance from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (r = -0.418; P = 0.017), however this was not continuous and "patches" with higher levels of methylation were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case 2 tumor was less methylated than Case 1 tumor (average β-value 0.181 vs. 0.415) and no significant difference in the level of methylation was observed in comparison to the surrounding NNCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No evidence was found for a diminishing gradient of methylation in the NNCM surrounding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with a high level of methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further work is required to determine whether CIMP+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> develop from within "patches" of NCCM that display high levels of methylation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
