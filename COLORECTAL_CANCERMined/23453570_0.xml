<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Survival from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> has improved substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the consequences of treatment is important to optimise patient support and minimise impact on daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to define the long-term prevalence of pelvic dysfunction following curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> surgery (+/- radiotherapy) within the context of overall quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated bowel, urinary and sexual function and quality of life using three validated questionnaires in patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This group was compared to patients undergoing abdominal surgery without pelvic dissection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> during the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 57% (381/667) with a median time interval of 4.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A subset of rectal patients documented persistent problems with faecal leakage (16%); requiring to alter daily activities (18%); always needing to wear a protective pad (17%); rarely or never emptying their bowels fully (31%); difficulty controlling the passage of gas (32%) and requiring to modify diet (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altered bowel function was found to impact on overall quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men reported increased erectile function difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative radiotherapy was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003867'>increased defecation</z:mp> problems as was low level of anastomosis (≤6 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In keeping with emergent evidence, this study has quantified the extent of late adverse effects with a sub-set of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients reporting persistent bowel function problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The implications are now to consider current follow-up services and to 'trial' new models of comprehensive assessment and interventions in patients who are 'at risk' of experiencing late adverse effects of treatment </plain></SENT>
