<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to review the clinical features and outcomes of patients who developed proximal bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery, and to assess the incidence and the risk factors for this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing high or low ligation for sigmoid colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> with a primary anastomosis between April 2004 and March 2009 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics and the incidence of bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and nine patients were included to the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six out of 302 patients (2.0%) with high ligation developed proximal bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, while the remaining 107 patients with low ligation did not suffer from this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who developed proximal bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> underwent secondary surgery with resection of necrotic bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed mucosal to transmural ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> without the evidence of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or embolic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that advanced age, cerebrovascular disease, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were significantly associated with proximal bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that cerebrovascular disease was an independent predictor of this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these six patients, two died from associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proximal bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after high ligation is potentially fatal, and this report provides a warning in clinical settings where high ligation is indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to evaluate its distinct relationship with high ligation and to clarify whether low ligation would be a safeguard </plain></SENT>
