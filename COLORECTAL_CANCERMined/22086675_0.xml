<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Silibinin has shown promising efficacy against various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and therefore here we assessed whether silibinin targets NF-κB activation and associated signaling as a mechanism of its anti-inflammatory and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that silibinin treatment (50-200 µM) of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> SW480, LoVo, and HT29 cells strongly inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α-induced NF-κB activation together with decreased nuclear levels of both p65 and p50 sub-units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Silibinin also significantly increased IκBα level with a concomitant decrease in phospho-IκBα, without any effect on TNFR1, TRADD, and RIP2, indicating its inhibitory effect on IκB kinase α activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next we assessed the effect of oral silibinin feeding on NF-κB pathway in SW480 (COX-2 negative) and LoVo (COX-2 positive) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together with its inhibitory efficacy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and progression, silibinin inhibited NF-κB activation in both xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of various NF-κB-regulated molecules such as Bcl-2, COX-2, iNOS, VEGF, and MMPs were also decreased by silibinin in both cell culture studies and xenograft analyses, suggesting its potential to alter NF-κB transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings are highly significant in establishing for the first time that silibinin suppresses <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> growth and progression possibly through its anti-inflammatory activity by interfering with NF-κB activation and thus has potential against human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
