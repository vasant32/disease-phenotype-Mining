<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper was to contribute additional evidence on this topic for men and women in a large prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 1999, 42,824 men and 56,876 women in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort completed a questionnaire with information on dietary garlic consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Garlic supplement use was assessed in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 7 years of follow-up, 579 men and 551 women were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among men, daily garlic consumption was associated with a non-significant higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (HR = 1.04, 95 % CI 0.99-1.08 for each additional clove or "4 shakes" of garlic per week), whereas the association was borderline inverse in women (HR = 0.95, 95 % CI 0.91-1.00, p <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> by sex = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Garlic supplement use was not related to a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and in men, former use was associated with a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HR = 1.85, 95 % CI 1.13-3.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results provide weak support for a role of dietary garlic consumption in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prevention in women, but a possible increased risk in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to confirm different associations by sex </plain></SENT>
