<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2007, 250 malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were identified in Lombardy, out of 1,329 screen-detected colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Italian Group for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> (GISCoR) promoted the multicentric study "Endoscopic Follow-up versus Surgical Radicalization of Malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> after Complete Endoscopic Polypectomy" (SEC-GISCoR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protocol was a multicentric, prospective, observational, non-randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It included patients diagnosed a colorectal malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, after complete endoscopic removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From November 2005 to September 2009, three participating centers enrolled 120 patients with malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> after "complete" endoscopic polypectomy; malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were classified as "low risk" or "high risk" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study had two arms: "Intensive follow-up" (42 patients: 32 with low-risk and 10 with high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>) and "Surgical radicalization" (78 patients: 5 with low-risk and 73 with high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were collected using an online CRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 37/120 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (30.8%) were low risk and 83/120 (69.2%) were high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>42 out of 120 patients (35%) were enrolled in the "clinical follow-up" arm, while 78/120 (65%) entered the surgery arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 15 cases, patients were not enrolled in the correct arm, according to the criteria agreed upon before starting the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There still is a high incidence (11.5%) of pathological mismatches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No clinical event was reported in 2.9 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, some differences emerged in the management of patients with malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> among participating centers (p &lt; 0.001), mismatches can be explained by high surgical risk or patient's choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only in 5 cases (4.2%), did data analysis not allow to exactly determine the reason for a choice different from protocol criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The availability of new risk factors and the evidence of pathological mismatches confirmed the need for future studies on this issue </plain></SENT>
