<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) imposes a substantial health burden on individual patients and society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rising costs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> cause a growing concern about reimbursement for innovations in this sector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The promise of pharmacogenomic profiling and related stratified therapies in mCRC is to improve treatment efficacy and potentially save costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among other examples, the commonly used epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab are only effective in patients with kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene homolog (KRAS) <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hence, the adaptation of predictive biomarker testing might be a valid strategy for healthcare systems worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the clinical and economic evidence supporting pharmacogenomic profiling prior to the administration of pharmaceutical treatment in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, key drivers and areas of uncertainty in cost-effectiveness evaluations are analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of predictive biomarkers and the result dependent usage of pharmaceutical agents in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The application of predictive biomarkers to detect KRAS mutations prior to the administration of EGFR antibodies saved treatment costs and was cost effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, because of the lack of data regarding cost-effectiveness analyses for predictive biomarker testing, e.g. for first-line treatment, definitive conclusions cannot be stated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Key drivers and areas of uncertainty in current cost-effectiveness analyses are, among others, the consideration of predictive biomarker costs, the characteristics of single predictive biomarkers and the availability of clinical data for the respective pharmaceutical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Especially the cost effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) mutation analysis prior to irinotecan-based chemotherapy remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenomic profiling has the potential to improve the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatment in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hence, quantification of the economic impact of stratified medicine as well as cost-effectiveness analyses of pharmacogenomic profiling are becoming more important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the methods applied in cost-effectiveness evaluations for the usage of predictive biomarkers for patient selection as well as the level of evidence required to determine clinical effectiveness are areas for further research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, mCRC is one of the first indications in which stratified therapies are used in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thus, clinical and economic experiences could be helpful when adopting pharmacogenomic profiling into clinical practice for other indications </plain></SENT>
