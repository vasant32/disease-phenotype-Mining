<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the first prospective study to show the association by subsite (proximal colon, distal colon, rectum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, we conducted a large, population-based prospective study, characterized by high fish consumption and a wide range of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intakes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were followed from response to a lifestyle questionnaire in 1995-1999 through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 827,833 person-years of follow-up (average 9.3 years), we identified 1,268 new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases (521 colon and 253 rectal for men; 350 colon and 144 rectal for women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the lowest quintile, the relative risk and 95% confidence interval of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> among the fifth quintile of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake were 0.60 and 0.31-1.14, respectively (p for trend = 0.04) in the colon in women and 0.35 and 0.14-0.88 (p for trend = 0.05) and 1.82 and 0.79-4.20 (p for trend = 0.16) in the proximal and distal colon, respectively, in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, the dose response for marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids s was unclear; rather, we observed U-shaped associations in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence that n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids increases or the n-3/n-6 ratio decreases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that intake of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be inversely related to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the proximal site of the large bowel </plain></SENT>
