<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current chemotherapy has major limitations, and a novel therapeutic approach is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> of colon epithelial cells is a consequence of genetic and epigenetic alterations, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference (RNAi) has been proposed as a new therapeutic strategy that offers important advantages over conventional treatments, with high specificity and potency and low toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RNAi has been employed as an effective tool to study the function of genes, preventing their expression and leading to the development of new approaches to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, RNAi is being used for "silencing" genes that are deregulated by different processes such as gene amplification, mutation, or overexpression and may be the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This strategy not only provides information on the involvement of certain genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, but also opens up a new perspective for its treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, most studies have used adenovirus or lentivirus vectors to transport RNAi into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in animal models, because several technical obstacles must be overcome before RNAi can be used in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to review current knowledge on the use of RNAi techniques in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
