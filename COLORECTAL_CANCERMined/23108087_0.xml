<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background/Aims: To describe survival rates and prognostic factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) operated in a district general hospital setting with a special focus on the number of lymph nodes examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methodology: Between December 2004 and December 2006, a total of 277 CRC patients who underwent surgical treatment in QHSU were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up intensively from discharge until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or the end of the follow-up (December 31, 2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: The median follow-up period was 53 months (range, 1-72 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall 3-year survival was 72.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In only 11.5% of the specimens were 12 or more lymph nodes retrieved, but this did not affect survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis identified that the significant prognostic factors were TNM stage III [adjusted hazard ratio (HR):5.49; 95%CI:1.64-18.41], TNM stage IV (adjusted HR: 7.55; 95%CI: 2.12-26.84), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology (adjusted HR: 1.88; 95%CI: 1.16-3.04), hospital stay (adjusted HR: 1.03; 95%CI: 1.00-1.06) and lymph node ratio (LNR) (adjusted HR: 3.92; 95%CI: 1.79-8.55) for stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: TNM stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology and the length of hospital stay could prominently affect outcome overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lymph node count did not have a significant impact on survival, whereas the LNR proved significant for stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a protocol using overall lymph node yield as a surrogate measure for more radical surgery seems warranted to improve the lymph node resected </plain></SENT>
