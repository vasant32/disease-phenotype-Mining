<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and high microsatellite instability (MSI) have a better outcome than their chromosome-unstable counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of microsatellite-unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, we wanted to see whether any MSI-associated molecular features are specifically associated with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred and nine MSI-high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were typed for primary mismatch repair (MMR) defect and for secondary loss of MMR proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frameshifts at seven target genes, mutations in the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> pathway, and methylation at MLH1/CDKN2A promoters were also searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interplay of molecular findings with clinicopathologic features and patient survival was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 84 MLH1-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, 31 (36.9%) had MSH3 and 11 (13.1%) had MSH6 loss (P &lt; 0.001), biallelic frameshift mutations at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> repeats accounting for most (78%) MSH3 losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As compared with MSH3-retaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, MLH1-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with MSH3 loss showed a higher number of mutated target genes (3.94 ± 1.56 vs. 2.79 ± 1.75; P = 0.001), absence of nodal involvement at pathology [N0; OR, 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04-0.43, P &lt; 0.001], and better disease-free survival (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No prognostic value was observed for KRAS status and for MLH1/CDKN2A promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between MSH3 loss and N0 was confirmed in an independent cohort of 71 MLH1-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.83, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MLH1-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> not expressing MSH3 have a more severe MSI, a lower rate of nodal involvement, and a better postsurgical outcome </plain></SENT>
