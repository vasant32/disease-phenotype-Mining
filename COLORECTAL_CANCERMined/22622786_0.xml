<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233702" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Fear of pain</z:e> and also time-consuming costly sedation are barriers for colonoscopy, and thus development of colonoscopy equipment that decreases patient discomfort is worthwhile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This randomized controlled trial investigated the performance of an ultrathin colonoscope in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive participants in a colonoscopy screening trial were randomized to examination with an ultrathin prototype colonoscope or a standard colonoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was pain during the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants rated pain (no, slight, moderate, severe) using a validated questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 187 enrolled participants (80 women [43 %]), 162 (87 %) responded to the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study groups were similar regarding baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pain scores were significantly lower in the prototype instrument group compared with the standard group (78 % vs. 29 % of patients with no pain in prototype and standard groups, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 0.11; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.06 - 0.23; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cecal intubation rate was 98 % in the prototype group and 92 % in the standard group (P = 0.085) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sedation was used in 2 % and 7 % in the prototype and standard groups respectively (P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate was 13 % in the prototype group vs. 24 % in the standard group (P = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The new ultrathin Olympus colonoscope decreases patient pain during screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This feature may improve uptake and patient satisfaction in screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed to evaluate the lower <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
