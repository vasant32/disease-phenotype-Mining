<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>F1 domain of F(1)F(o)-ATPase was initially believed to be strictly expressed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, recent reports have shown that the F1 complex can serve as a cell surface receptor for apparently unrelated ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show for the first time the presence of the F(1)-ATPase at the cell surface of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or cancerous colonic epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using surface plasmon resonance technology and mass spectrometry, we identified a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormone</z:chebi> product of the gastrin gene (glycine-extended gastrin (G-gly)) as a new ligand for the F(1)-ATPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By molecular modeling, we identified the motif in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence (E(E/D)XY), that directly interacts with the F(1)-ATPase and the amino acids in the F(1)-ATPase that bind this motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replacement of the Glu-9 residue by an alanine in the E(E/D)XY motif resulted in a strong decrease of G-gly binding to the F(1)-ATPase and the loss of its biological activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition we demonstrated that F(1)-ATPase mediates the growth effects of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, blocking F(1)-ATPase activity decreases G-gly-induced cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism likely involves <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> production by the membrane F(1)-ATPase, which is induced by G-gly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest an important contribution of cell surface F(1)-ATPase in the pro-proliferative action of this gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
