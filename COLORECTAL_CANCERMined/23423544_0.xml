<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extensive MD-simulation of the PDB and solvated structures of hMMP-8 has revealed the presence of few conserved water molecules around the catalytic and structural zinc (ZnC and ZnS) ions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coordination of two conserved water molecules (W and WS) to ZnS and the H-bonding interaction of WS to S151 have indicated the plausible involvement of that metal ion in the catalytic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beside this the coupling of ZnC and ZnS metal ions (ZnC - W(H) (W(1))…..W(2) ….H(162) - ZnS) through two conserved hydrophilic centers (occupied by water molecules) may also provide some rational on the recognition of two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27365">zinc ions</z:chebi> which were separated by ~13 Å in their X-ray structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This unique recognition of both the Zn(+2) ions in the enzyme through conserved water molecules may be implemented/ exploited for the design of antiproteolytic agent using water mimic drug design protocol </plain></SENT>
