<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate clinicopathologic and molecular features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) and their outcomes in early-phase trials using pathway-targeting agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed characteristics of 238 patients with mCRC referred to the phase 1 trials unit at MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF status were tested using PCR-based DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of patients harbored KRAS mutations; 15% had PIK3CA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate regression model for clinical characteristics KRAS mutations were associated with an increased incidence of lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastases</z:e> and decreased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854178" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adrenal metastases</z:e>; PIK3CA mutations were marginally correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumors</z:e> (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations were strongly associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Advanced Duke's stage (p&lt;0.0001) and KRAS mutations (p = 0.01) were the only significant independent predictors of poor survival (Cox proportional hazards model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with PIK3CA mutations had a trend toward shorter progression-free survival when treated with anti-EGFR therapies (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 78 assessable patients (23%) treated with PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis inhibitors achieved stable disease [SD] ≥6 months or complete response/partial response (CR/PR), only one of whom were in the subgroup (N = 15) with PIK3CA mutations, perhaps because 10 of these 15 patients (67%) had coexisting KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No SD ≥6 months/CR/PR was observed in the 10 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway targeting drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KRAS and PIK3CA mutations frequently coexist in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and are associated with clinical characteristics and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overcoming resistance may require targeting both pathways </plain></SENT>
