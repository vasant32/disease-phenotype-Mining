<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relation between <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi> intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We prospectively evaluated whether a higher <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi> intake in the remote past is more strongly associated with a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> than is an intake in the recent past in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We assessed <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi> intake every 4 y by using validated food-frequency questionnaires and followed 86,440 women and 44,410 men for ≤28 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable RRs and 95% CIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi> intake was significantly associated with an ∼20-30% lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in age-adjusted results, but this association became attenuated and nonsignificant after additional adjustment for nondietary and dietary factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the highest to lowest quintiles of cumulative total <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi> intake were compared, RRs (95% CIs) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were 0.99 (0.80, 1.24; P-trend = 0.55) for women and 0.95 (0.73, 1.23; P-trend = 0.75) for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the same comparison, RRs were 0.92 (0.73, 1.16) for total <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi> intake 0-4 y before diagnosis, 0.99 (0.78, 1.26) for intake 4-8 y before diagnosis, 0.92 (0.71, 1.21) for intake 8-12 y before diagnosis, and 0.93 (0.69, 1.26) for intake 12-16 y before diagnosis in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corresponding RRs for men were 0.86 (0.63, 1.17), 0.96 (0.70, 1.32), 0.90 (0.63, 1.29), and 1.16 (0.75, 1.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results did not differ by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> subsite, source of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi> (food or supplement), alcohol consumption, or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data do not support a strong role of adulthood <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi> intake in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in these US health professionals </plain></SENT>
