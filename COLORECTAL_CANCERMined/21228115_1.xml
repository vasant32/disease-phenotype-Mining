<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prepared phage microarrays containing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cDNA libraries to identify phage-expressed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> recognized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific autoantibodies from patient sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a total of 1536 printed phages, 128 gave statistically significant values to discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients from control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From this, 43 peptide sequences were unique following DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six phages containing homologous sequences to STK4/MST1, SULF1, NHSL1, SREBF2, GRN, and GTF2I were selected to build up a predictor panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A previous study with high-density protein microarrays had identified STK4/MST1 as a candidate biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An independent collection of 153 serum samples (50 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sera and 103 reference samples, including healthy donors and sera from other related pathologies) was used as a validation set to study prediction capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A combination of four phages and two recombinant proteins, corresponding to MST1 and SULF1, achieved an area under the curve of 0.86 to correctly discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> from healthy sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of sera from other different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> did not change significantly this value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For early stages (A+B), the corrected area under the curve was 0.786 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we have demonstrated that MST1 and SULF1 proteins, homologous to phage-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequences, can replace the original phages in the predictor panel, improving their diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
