<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: : Patients with nonresectable CLMs have poor prognosis, and few survive beyond 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLMs are currently considered an absolute contraindication for liver transplantation, although liver transplantation for primary and some secondary liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> shows excellent outcome in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before 1995, several liver transplantations for CLMs were performed, but outcome was poor (5-year survival rate: 18%) and liver transplantation for CLMs was abandoned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since then, the survival rate after liver transplantation in general has improved by almost 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this, a 5-year survival rate of about 50% after liver transplantation for CLMs could be anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : In a prospective pilot study, liver transplantation for nonresectable CLMs was performed (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Main inclusion criteria were liver-only CLMs, excised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, and at least 6 weeks of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Kaplan-Meier estimates of the OS rate at 1, 3, and 5 years were 95%, 68%, and 60%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Metastatic recurrence of disease was common (mainly pulmonary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a significant proportion of the recurrences were accessible for surgery, and at follow-up (after median of 27 months; range, 8-60), 33% had no evidence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>Hepatic tumor</z:mpath> load before liver transplantation, time from primary surgery to liver transplantation, and progressive disease on chemotherapy were identified as significant prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : OS exceeds by far reported outcome for chemotherapy, which is the only treatment option available for this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, OS is comparable with liver resection for resectable CLMs and survival after repeat liver transplantation for nonmalignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Selection strategies based on prognostic factors may further improve the outcome (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01311453) </plain></SENT>
