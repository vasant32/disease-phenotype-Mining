<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two drug entities were loaded into calcium alginate beads, engineered to erode upon exposure to a de-crosslinking agent, to allow for the controlled, concomitant release of the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The synchronized release-driven improved cytotoxicity of NUT and Doxil was tested in vitro in RKO (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53) and HT-29 (mutant p53) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, by measuring intracellular expression of p53, p21 and Mdm2, as well as monitoring cell proliferation and viable cell numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NUT treatment alone was identified to be cytotoxic exclusively towards RKO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, coadministration of NUT enhanced Doxil's anti-proliferative effects and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induction in a synergistic manner in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also identified that combinatorial treatment in a wt p53 context affected the p53 pathway by elevating the expression of p53 and its target p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The capability of the formulation to erode in the presence of a de-crosslinking agent was demonstrated in vivo in the cecum of the anesthetized rat using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> as a poorly water-soluble PK probe </plain></SENT>
