<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in people with CKD (stages 3-5, transplant recipients and those on dialysis) from three centres in Sydney, Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured participants' own QOL and that of two hypothetical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> health states using a rating scale, and a utility-based QOL measure, the time trade-off, with extremes of 0 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) and 1 (full health) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recipients of kidney transplants (n=79) had the highest mean QOL weights of 0.79 (standard deviation (SD)=0.34) compared with participants with CKD 3-5 (n=53) with mean QOL weights of 0.70 (SD=0.39), and those on dialysis (n=89), who had the lowest mean QOL weights of 0.62 (SD=0.41) (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Having early and advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were valued at mean QOL weights of 0.44 (SD=0.41) and 0.12 (SD=0.25) among people with moderate stage CKD; 0.45 (SD=0.39) and 0.11 (SD=0.24) among dialysis patients; 0.62 (SD=0.36) and 0.18 (SD=0.29) among kidney transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: People with CKD have poor QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Having coexistent illnesses such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> further reduces the overall well-being of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to the development of effective screening and treatment programs to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes in people with CKD, our study also highlights the need for effective interventions to improve the QOL in people with CKD, particularly those with major comorbidities like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
