<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate (ADR) is one of the main quality measures for colonoscopy, but it is burdensome to calculate and is not amenable to claims-based reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To validate the correlation between polypectomy rates (PRs) and ADRs by using a large group of endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community and academic endoscopy units in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Sixty endoscopists and their patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Proportion of patients with any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removed; correlation between ADRs and PRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 14,341 screening colonoscopies were included, and there was high correlation between endoscopists' PRs and ADRs in men ( r(s)= .91, P &lt; .0001) and women (r(s) = .91, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists with PRs in the highest quartile had a significantly higher ADR than did those in the lowest quartile in men (44.6% vs 19.4%, P &lt; .0001) and women (33.6% vs 11.6%, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists in the top polypectomy quartile also found more advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> than did endoscopists in the bottom quartile (men: 9.6% vs 4.6%, P = .0006; women: 6.3% vs 3.0%, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Benchmark PRs of 40% and 30% correlated with ADRs greater than 25% and 15% for men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Retrospective analysis of a subset of a national endoscopic database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopists' PRs correlate well with their ADRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given its clinical relevance, its simplicity, and the ease with which it can be incorporated into claims-based reporting programs, the PR may become an important quality measure </plain></SENT>
