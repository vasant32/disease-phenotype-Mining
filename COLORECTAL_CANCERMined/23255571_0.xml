<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Associations might be modified by mandated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (FA) fortification or alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations between intakes of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B-12</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, stratified by time exposed to FA fortification and alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 88,045 postmenopausal women were recruited during 1993-1998; 1003 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were ascertained as of 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quartiles of dietary intakes were compared; HRs and 95% CIs were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dietary and total intakes of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B-6</z:chebi> in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.97 and HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.99, respectively) and total intakes of <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi> (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.99) were associated with reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> overall and of regionally spread disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In current drinkers who consumed &lt;1 drink (13 g alcohol)/wk, B vitamin intakes were inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (P-interaction &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake was positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk among women who had experienced the initiation of FA fortification for 3 to &lt;9 y (P-interaction &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">Vitamin B-6</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi> intakes from diet and supplements were associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associations of B vitamin intake were particularly strong for regional disease and among women drinkers who consumed alcohol infrequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study provides new evidence that the increased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake during the early postfortification period may have been associated with a transient increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
