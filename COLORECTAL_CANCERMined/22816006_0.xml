<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now know that 90% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> develop from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polypectomy of colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> leads to a significant reduction in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At present most of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> are removed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> identified at colonoscopy are small and do not pose a significant challenge for resection to an appropriately trained and skilled endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Advanced polypectomy techniques are intended for the removal of difficult <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colon polyps</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have defined a "difficult <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>" as any lesion that due to its size, shape or location represents a challenge for the colonoscopist to remove </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although many "difficult <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>" will be an easy target for the advanced endoscopist, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> that are larger than 15 mm, have a large pedicle, are flat and extended, are difficult to see or are located in the cecum or any angulated portion of the colon should be always considered difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although very successful, advanced resection techniques can potentially cause serious, even life-threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, post polypectomy complications are more common in the presence of difficult <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, any endoscopist attempting advanced polypectomy techniques should be adequately supervised by an expert or have an excellent training in interventional endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This review describes several useful tips and tricks to deal with difficult <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
