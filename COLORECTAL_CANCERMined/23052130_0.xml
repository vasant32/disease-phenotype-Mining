<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first pathway, chromosome instability (CIN), is driven by APC mutations and is typified by Kras mutations, p53 mutation/loss of heterozygosity, and deletions at chromosome 18q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second pathway is referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI), a genetic hallmark of the accumulated mutations that occur as a consequence of derangements in the mismatch repair genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> may involve methylation of a number of genes, which is frequently referred to as the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and are associated with B-raf mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability to stratify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> by risk would be facilitated by the identification of polymorphisms that might be utilized as biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LIN28B is an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> binding protein that is overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We find that LIN28B rs314277 is associated with significant recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Stage II disease, which may have translational therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
