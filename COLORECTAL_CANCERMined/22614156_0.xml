<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is driven by genetic alterations causing its progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides accepted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor- and onco- genes, a series of genes have been identified, which contribute to transformation into a more malignant stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the expression level of such genes, alone or in combination, could add to predict the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> samples from 118 CRC patients were screened in a retrospective analysis by qRT-PCR for expression of the four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>-associated genes osteopontin (Opn), transforming growth factor β (Tgf-β), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp-2) and cyclooxigenase-2 (Cox-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting qRT-PCR values were related to those of housekeeping genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were clustered for similar expression levels between the four genes with R statistical software using the package pvclust, which provides bootstrap agglomerative hierarchical clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clusters with similar expression of the four genes were analyzed for correlation with UICC stages and survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of the four genes varied considerably within the cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis of patients revealed a subgroup (n = 33) who in comparison with the other patients showed tenfold higher expression levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four genes (p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was no correlation between patients expressing high or low levels of these four genes and known parameters of clinical prognosis (UICC stages, survival time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, tenfold increased expression levels of Opn, Tgf-β, Mmp-2 and Cox-2 in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients did not predict for a clinical outcome that is different from that of the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
