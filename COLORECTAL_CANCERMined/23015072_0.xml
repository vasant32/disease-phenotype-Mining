<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Targeted therapies using the anti-EGFR antibodies panitumumab (Pmab) or cetuximab (Cmab) are currently restricted to patients with metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> do not show a mutation in KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent retrospective studies indicated that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> mutated in codon 13 of KRAS may benefit from treatment with Cmab in contrast to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> mutated in KRAS codon 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To study the functional impact of the subtype of KRAS mutations on the efficiency of EGFR-targeted therapies, we correlated the KRAS mutation status of 15 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines with the in vitro sensitivity of these cells to Cmab/Pmab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the potential predictive biomarkers BRAF and PIK3CA as well as protein expression of EGFR and PTEN were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four out of seven KRAS-mutated cell lines were characterised by the p.G13D mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these cells using Cmab/Pmab induced a significant growth inhibition in contrast to cell lines showing a KRAS mutation at codon 12 or 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of the eight KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cell lines, five were insensitive to Cmab/Pmab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cell lines were characterised either by BRAF mutation or by absence of EGFR or PTEN protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since KRAS p.G13D-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells may respond to EGFR-targeted therapy, we suggest including subtype analysis of KRAS mutations in prospective clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, BRAF mutations and loss of EGFR or PTEN expression may lead to resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy and should be considered as additional negative predictive biomarkers </plain></SENT>
