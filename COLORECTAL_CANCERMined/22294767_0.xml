<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Known differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates are mainly attributed to differences in diet and other environmental factors represented, among others, by nutrition-related complex diseases (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005978'>diabetes mellitus type II</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within the last years, it has become evident that environmental risk factors can be complemented by a genetic component when considering the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, a number of polymorphisms are known to be associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that the 'ancestral-susceptibility model' can be reasonably applied to nutrition-related complex diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The work in hand shortly discusses whether the ancestral-susceptibility model can also be applied to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as a nutrition-related complex disease </plain></SENT>
