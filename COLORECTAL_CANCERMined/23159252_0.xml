<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous trials of decision <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> to increase SDM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening uptake have yielded mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the impact of decision aid-assisted SDM on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted at an urban, academic safety-net hospital and community health center between 2005 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants were asymptomatic, average-risk patients aged 50-75 years due for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Study participants (n=825) were randomized to one of two intervention arms (decision aid plus personalized risk assessment or decision aid alone) or control arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interventions took place just prior to a routine office visit with their primary care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was completion of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test within 12 months of the study visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of test completion and mediators of the intervention effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis was completed in 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the decision-aid group were more likely to complete a screening test than control patients (43.1% vs 34.8%, p=0.046) within 12 months of the study visit; conversely, test uptake for the decision aid and decision aid plus personalized risk assessment arms was similar (43.1% vs 37.1%, p=0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Assignment to the decision-aid arm (AOR=1.48, 95% CI=1.04, 2.10), black race (AOR=1.52, 95% CI=1.12, 2.06) and a preference for a patient-dominant decision-making approach (AOR=1.55, 95% CI=1.02, 2.35) were independent determinants of test completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Activation of the screening discussion and enhanced screening intentions mediated the intervention effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decision aid-assisted SDM has a modest impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A decision aid plus personalized risk assessment tool is no more effective than a decision aid alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.govNCT00251862 </plain></SENT>
