<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this report, we present the results of a phase II trial of FOLFOX6+bevacizumab in patients with non-optimally resectable CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received six cycles of FOLFOX6+ five of bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients not achieving resectability received six additional cycles of each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A PET-CT was performed at baseline and again within 1 month after initiating treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From September 2005 to July 2009, 21 patients were enrolled (Male/Female: 15/6; median age: 65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An objective response (OR) was documented in 12 cases (57.1%; complete responses (CRs): 3, partial response (PR): 9); one patient died from toxicity before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients underwent radical surgery (61.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three (23%) had a pathological CR (pCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients (46.1%) experienced minor postsurgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a median 38.8-month follow-up, the median OS was 22.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients achieving at least 1 unit reduction in Standard uptake value (SUV)max on PET-CT had longer progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS: 22 vs 14 months, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX6+bevacizumab does not increase postsurgical complications, yields high rates of resectability and pCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early changes in PET-CT seem to be predictive of longer PFS </plain></SENT>
