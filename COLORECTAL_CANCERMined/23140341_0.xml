<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the accuracy of linked routinely collected administrative health data for monitoring colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> care in New South Wales (NSW), Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> cases diagnosed in NSW between 2000 and 2002 were identified from the NSW Central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (CCR) and linked to their hospital discharge records in the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These records were then linked to data from two relevant population-based patterns of care surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were the sensitivity and specificity of data from the CCR and APDC for disease staging, investigative procedures, curative surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and selected comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data for 2917 colorectal and 1580 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unknown disease stage was more common for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in the administrative data (18%) than in the survey (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopies were captured reasonably accurately in the administrative data compared with the surveys (82% and 79% respectively; 91% sensitivity, 53% specificity) but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other colorectal or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> diagnostic procedures were under-enumerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases had potentially curative surgery recorded in the administrative data compared to 95% in the survey (96% sensitivity, 92% specificity), with similar accuracy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (16% and 17%; 92% sensitivity, 99% specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy (~40% sensitivity) and radiotherapy (sensitivityâ‰¤30%) were vastly under-enumerated in the administrative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only comorbidity that was recorded reasonably accurately in the administrative data was <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Linked routinely collected administrative health data provided reasonably accurate information on potentially curative surgical treatment, colonoscopies and comorbidities such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other diagnostic procedures, comorbidities, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were not well enumerated in the administrative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other sources of data will be required to comprehensively monitor the primary management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
