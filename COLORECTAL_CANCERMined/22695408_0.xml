<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the associations between these assessments and overall survival in stage IV colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anthropometric measures, energy intake, biochemical variables, nutritional risk screening, assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> and body composition from computed tomography images were analysed, in 77 patients from Norway and Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were dichotomized into presence or absence of nutritional risk, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> and sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and associated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 22% up to 55% of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> according to different <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> criteria: 34% were malnourished, 42% were at nutritional risk, and 39% were sarcopenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent of the patients did not meet criteria for any of these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> defined by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>Cachexia</z:hpo> Study Group (CCSG) had shorter survival in an unadjusted analysis, [Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-4.47; P = 0.005] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for nation, age and gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> (HR = 2.26; CI 1.18-4.32; P = 0.014) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> (HR = 1.83; CI 1.06-3.13; P = 0.029) remained significant predictors of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in up to 55% of the patients was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lack of concordance between the results obtained by different assessment criteria was obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CCSG's <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> score was the best prognostic factor for overall survival </plain></SENT>
