<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Among the 294 patients with non-resectable colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> enrolled in the Fédération Francophone de Cancérologie Digestive (FFCD) 9601 phase III trial, which compared different first-line single-agent chemotherapy regimens, 216 patients (73%) presented with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> at study entry and constituted the present study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Potential baseline prognostic variables including prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> resection were assessed by univariate and multivariate Cox analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS curves were compared with the logrank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 216 patients with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (median follow-up, 33 months), 156 patients (72%) had undergone resection of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> prior to study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resection and non-resection groups did not differ for baseline characteristics except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> location (rectum, 14% versus 35%; p=0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, resection of the primary was the strongest independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio (HR), 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-0.8; p=0.0002) and OS (HR, 0.4; CI, 0.3-0.6; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both median PFS (5.1 [4.6-5.6] versus 2.9 [2.2-4.1] months; p=0.001) and OS (16.3 [13.7-19.2] versus 9.6 [7.4-12.5]; p&lt;0.0001) were significantly higher in the resection group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences in patient survival were maintained after exclusion of patients with rectal primary (n=43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> may be associated with longer PFS and OS in patients with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> starting first-line, single-agent chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
