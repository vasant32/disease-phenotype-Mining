<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Proteomic approach was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proteins were extracted using Tris buffer and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36946">thiourea</z:chebi> lysis buffer (TLB) for extraction of aqueous soluble and membrane-associated proteins, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemometrics, namely principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), were used to assess the usefulness of these proteins for identifying the cancerous state of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Differentially expressed proteins identified were 37 aqueous soluble proteins in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi> extracts and 24 membrane-associated proteins in TLB extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the protein spots intensity on 2D-gel images, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> by applying an eigenvalue &gt; 1 was successfully used to reduce the number of principal components (PCs) into 12 and seven PCs for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi> and TLB extracts, respectively, and subsequently six PCs, respectively from both the extracts were used for LDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LDA classification for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi> extract showed 82.7% of original samples were correctly classified, whereas 82.7% were correctly classified for the cross-validated samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LDA for TLB extract showed that 78.8% of original samples and 71.2% of the cross-validated samples were correctly classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues by <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and LDA provided a promising distinction between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These methods can possibly be used for identification of potential biomarkers among the differentially expressed proteins identified </plain></SENT>
