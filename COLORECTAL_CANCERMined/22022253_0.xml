<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is believed to arise from mutant stem cells in colonic crypts that undergo a well-characterized progression involving benign <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, the precursor to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a number of (epi)genetic events have been identified as drivers of this process, little is known about the dynamics involved in the stage-wise progression from the first appearance of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> to its ultimate conversion to malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By the time <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> become endoscopically detectable (i.e., are in the range of 1-2 mm in diameter), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> are already comprised of hundreds of thousands of cells and may have been in existence for several years if not decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, a large fraction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> may actually remain undetected during endoscopic screening and, at least in principle, could give rise to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> before they are detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is therefore of importance to establish what fraction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> is detectable, both as a function of when the colon is screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and as a function of the achievable detection limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To this end, we have derived mathematical expressions for the detectable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> number and size distributions based on a recently developed stochastic model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results and illustrations using these expressions suggest (1) that screening efficacy is critically dependent on the detection threshold and implicit knowledge of the relevant stem cell fraction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, (2) that a large fraction of non-extinct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> remains likely undetected assuming plausible detection thresholds and cell division rates, and (3), under a realistic description of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> initiation, growth and progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the empirical prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> is likely inflated with lesions that are not on the pathway to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
