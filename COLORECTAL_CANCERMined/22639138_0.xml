<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One understudied strategy for increasing physical activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors may be sport participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the sport participation rate, sport preferences, and correlates of sport participation among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A provincial, population-based mailed survey of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors in Alberta, Canada was performed and included measures of sport participation, sport preferences, sport benefits and barriers, and medical and demographic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 600 CRC survivors completed the survey (34 % response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Almost a quarter (23.0 %) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors reported participating in a sport in the past month, with the most common sport being golf (58.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, 33.0 % (p = 0.001) of the variance in sport participation was explained by being male (β = 0.12; p = 0.006), in better general health (β = 0.12; p = 0.006), and ≥ 5 years post-diagnosis (β = 0.09; p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common barriers to sport participation were time, age/agility, and no interest/dislike of sports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common anticipated benefits of sport participation were improved physical fitness, meeting people, and improved health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over half (57.2 %) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors were possibly interested in learning about sport participation opportunities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Promotion of sport participation may be a potentially fruitful strategy for increasing physical activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
