<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Intensive surveillance after curative treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is associated with improved overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined concordance with the 2005 ASCO surveillance guidelines at the population level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 250 patients diagnosed with stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 2004 and alive 42 months after diagnosis was identified from health administrative data in Manitoba, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy, liver imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing were assessed over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Guidelines were met if patients had at least one colonoscopy in 3 years and at least one liver imaging test and three CEA tests annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression assessed the effect of patient and physician characteristics and disease and treatment factors on guideline concordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Guidelines for colonoscopy, liver imaging, and CEA were met by 80.4%, 47.2%, and 22% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Guideline concordance for colonoscopy was predicted by annual contact with a surgeon, higher income, and the diagnosis of colon (rather than rectal) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adherence was lower in those older than 70 years and with higher comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For liver imaging, significant predictors were annual contact with an oncologist, receipt of chemotherapy, and diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concordance with CEA guidelines was higher with annual contact with an oncologist and high levels of family physician contact, and lower in urban residents, in those older than 70, and in those with stage II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Completion of recommended liver imaging and CEA testing fall well below guidelines in Manitoba, whereas colonoscopy is better provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Addressing this gap should improve outcomes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
