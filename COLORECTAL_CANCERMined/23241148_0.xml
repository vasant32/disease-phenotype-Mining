<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Caldesmon (CaD), a major actin-associated protein, is found in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Smooth muscle caldesmon, h-CaD, is a multifunctional protein, and non-muscle cell caldesmon, l-CaD, plays a role in cytoskeletal architecture and dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>h-CaD is thought to be an useful marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206658" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">smooth muscle tumors</z:e>, but the role(s) of l-CaD has not been examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> tissues were obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to chemoradiotherapy (CRT), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and cancerous tissues were obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole-tissue protein extracts were analyzed by 2-DE-based proteomics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression and phosphorylation level of main cellular signaling proteins were determined by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation after CaD siRNA transfection was monitored by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression level of l-CaD was significantly increased in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> tissues compared to the level in the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cancerous tissues obtained from the patients showing poor response to CRT (Dworak grade 4), the expression of l-CaD was increased compared to that of good response group (Dworak grade 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In line with, l-CaD positive human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines were more resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and radiation treatment compared to l-CaD negative cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Artificial suppression of l-CaD increased susceptibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells to 5-FU, and caused an increase of p21 and c-PARP, and a decrease of NF-kB and p-mTOR expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Up-regulated expression of l-CaD may have a role for increasing metastatic property and decreasing CRT susceptibility in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
