<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although repeating a prior chemotherapy [in particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and fluoropyrimidine (FOX)] is an option, there is very little evidence in the literature for this approach; thus, we reviewed our registry to assess the frequency and outcome of rechallenging with FOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who had been rechallenged with FOX were identified from the South Australian metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics were analyzed, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response was retrospectively assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients were eligible for inclusion in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of prior lines of therapy received for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 4 lines for 2 patients, 3 lines for 6 patients, 2 lines for 7 patients, and 1 line for 3 patients, with 3 patients having received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> as adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had received bevacizumab previously, 7 patients had undergone antiepidermal growth factor receptor treatment, and 4 patients had undergone liver resection earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rate was 18%, and 47% had stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 3.7 months, median overall survival was 7.8 months, and 1-year survival was 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this selected population, there is evidence of modest activity of rechallenge with FOX chemotherapy, although radiologic response is uncommon </plain></SENT>
