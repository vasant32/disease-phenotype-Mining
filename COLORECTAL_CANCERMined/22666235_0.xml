<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete cytoreduction was done in 62/81 (76.5%), 228/420 (54.3%), and 101/166 (60.8%) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, APN, and GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main reasons of incomplete resections were involvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> peritoneal regions and diffuse involvement of small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence (64%, 302/470) of CC-0 resection after introduction of an <z:chebi fb="105" ids="15377">aqua</z:chebi> dissection was significantly higher than before (42%, 82/197) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 41 (6.1%) patients died postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major complication (grade 3-4 complications) occurred in 126 patients (18.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A reoperation was necessary in 36 patients (5.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By the multivariate analysis, PCI scores capable of serving as thresholds for favorable versus poor prognosis in each group and CC scores demonstrated as the independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Peritonectomy using an <z:chebi fb="105" ids="15377">aqua</z:chebi> dissection improves the incidence of complete cytoreduction, and improves the survival of patients with PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with PCI larger than the threshold values should be treated with chemotherapy to improve the incidences of complete cytoreduction </plain></SENT>
