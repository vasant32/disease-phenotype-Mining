<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) mortality rates have been decreasing for many decades in the United States, with the decrease accelerating in the most recent time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent to which this decrease varies across states and its influence on the geographic patterns of rates is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the temporal trend in age-standardized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates for each state from 1990 to 2007 using joinpoint regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined the change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates between 1990-1994 and 2003-2007 using rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals and illustrated the change in pattern using maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the change in mortality rates and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates for 2004 by state was examined using Pearson's correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality rates significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> states except Mississippi between 1990 and 2007 based on the joinpoint model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates between 1990-1994 and 2003-2007 ranged from 9% in Alabama to greater than 33% in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and Alaska; Mississippi and Wyoming showed no significant decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generally, the northeastern states showed the largest decreases, whereas southern states showed the smallest decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality rates shifted from the northeastern states during 1990 to 1994 to the southern states along the Appalachian corridor during 2003 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality rates by state correlated strongly with uptake of screening (r = -0.65, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Progress in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality varies across states, with the Northeast showing the most progress and the South showing the least progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: These findings highlight the need for wider dissemination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
