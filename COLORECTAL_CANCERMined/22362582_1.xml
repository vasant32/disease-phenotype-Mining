<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by serum 25(OH)D concentration, comparing the relative effects of successively adding body mass index, physical activity, and other health and lifestyle characteristics particular to each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In models with matching factors only, low (vs. high) serum 25(OH)D was associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> odds ratio of 2.72 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.55, 4.77) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> odds ratio of 1.33 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.72) </plain></SENT>
