<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are diverse clinical settings in which a healthcare provider has the opportunity to assess an individual for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prediction models offer a potentially feasible and useful strategy to systematically identify at-risk individuals, whether they are affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or not, and to help with management of the implications of molecular and germline test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given the complexity of diagnostic information currently available to clinicians involved in identifying and caring for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, prediction models provide a useful and complementary aid in medical decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systematic implementation of prediction models estimates should be considered in routine clinical care and at various stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk assessment and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this manuscript, we review the main prediction models developed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, focus on their specific features and performance assessed in several validation studies, compare the models with other clinical and molecular strategies for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, and discuss their potential uses in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
