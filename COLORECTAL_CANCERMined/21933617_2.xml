<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: HIWI is a member of PIWI gene family and its expression is found in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, indicating that it may play a pivotal role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designated to examine HIWI protein expression profile in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines and its prognostic value for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Totally 270 patients who underwent surgical resection of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 1999 and December 2002 with a median follow-up time of 33 months were registered in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens from these patients and 236 matched adjacent non-cancerous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-HIWI monoclonal antibodies were generated and used for evaluating HIWI protein expression. Ï‡(2) tests were conducted to determine the association between HIWI expression and the other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was performed by using the Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By generating antibodies specific for HIWI, we examined HIWI protein expression in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines and demonstrated positive expression of HIWI in 69 out of 270 (25.6%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues; 15 of 236 (6.4%) matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues were also positive for HIWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive HIWI expression in adjacent non-cancerous tissue had statistically lower overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) compared with negative patients (OS: 10.4% vs. 55.5%, P = 0.009; DFS: 10.4% vs. 55.1%, P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For early stage group (stages I and II), patients with positive HIWI expression had significantly lower OS and DFS (OS: 57.4% vs. 79.5%, P = 0.014; DFS: 56.7% vs. 80.5%, P = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In lymph node negative group, patients with positive HIWI expression had statistically lower OS and DFS (OS: 53.0% vs. 73.5%, P = 0.037; DFS: 52.2% vs. 74.6%, P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that HIWI over-expression was a significant prognostic factor for OS (95%CI: 1.132 - 2.479, P = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HIWI could be a potential prognostic biomarker for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially for those at early stages or without lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
