<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During May 2008 to December 2008, Seventy patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> requiring colorectal resection were randomized into two groups: a fast track group (35 cases) and a conventional care group (35 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> included patients received elective open colorectal resection with combined tracheal intubation and general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters, stress markers and insulin sensitivity were evaluated in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 62 patients finally completed the study, 32 cases in the fast-track group and 30 cases in the conventional care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The speed of recovery of postoperative insulin sensitivity on 7 days postoperative in the fast-track group (97% ± 9%) was significantly faster than the conventional care group (88.5% ± 9.0%, t = 2.552, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hospitalization days in the fast-track group was 6 days (M(50)), and it was significantly shorter than the conventional care group ((11.7 ± 3.8) days, Z = 4.360, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time of recovery of bowel function were faster in the fast-track group (time to pass flatus was 2 days (M(50))) than the conventional care group (4 days, Z = 3.976, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Infectious complication rate in the fast-track group (2/32) is lower than the other group (8/30, P = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fast track surgery accelerates recovery of postoperative insulin sensitivity in elective surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with a lower rate of postoperative infectious complications and a shorter length of postoperative hospital stay </plain></SENT>
