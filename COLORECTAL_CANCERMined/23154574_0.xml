<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of adverse drug reaction reported with cetuximab from 1985 to 2010 were extracted from the French Pharmacovigilance database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The severity of infusion reactions was assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE criteria (v4.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the severity of infusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 602 adverse drug reaction reported with cetuximab during the study period, 374 infusion reactions were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indication is more likely to be head and neck than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among patients experiencing an infusion reaction (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> related to an infusion reaction, five patients were treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infusion reactions were more likely to be severe when they occurred during the first administration (OR = 7.40 95% CI [2.21-24.71]), adjusted for age, sex, region of France, quarter of the year, indication, year of occurrence, and premedication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study found that reports of infusion reactions more often concerned patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e>, that in these patients the adverse drug reaction was more often fatal and severe infusion reactions were more likely during the first administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In daily practice, the close monitoring of patients during the first infusion, especially patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e>, is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering the possible immunoglobulin E-mediated mechanism, reliable tests for their detection need to be readily available </plain></SENT>
