<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse relationships between socio-demographic characteristics, healthcare access, and behaviour with regard to participation in organised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed a subset of 2,276 individuals from a cross-sectional population-based survey of French households in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome was participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening using multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studied variables included socio-demographic characteristics, healthcare access-related variables, and health or perceived health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, living in a pilot district for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, and having a private additional insurance were associated with participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening for both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In men, other characteristics were associated: not having 100% coverage for medical fees for a long-term disease, having consulted a medical specialist in the last 12 months, and not smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening behaviours were associated with participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results also showed that 81.4% of individuals, who did not have a HemoccultÂ® test, consulted a GP in the last 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite efforts made, results confirmed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening differed among socioeconomic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GPs should be encouraged to systematically recommend <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening to their patients fitting the criteria of the organised <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programme and further investigation is required to optimise information strategies targeting GPs </plain></SENT>
