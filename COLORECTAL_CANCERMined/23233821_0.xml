<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi>-regulatory gene, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase 1 (Odc1, rs2302615) is prognostic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined joint effects of meat consumption and Odc1 polymorphism on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analytic cohort was comprised of 329 incident stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases diagnosed 1994-1996 with follow- up through March 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odc1 genotyping was conducted using primers that amplify a 172-bp fragment containing the polymorphic base at +316 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dietary questionnaires were administered at cohort entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mortality was stratified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, node, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (TNM) stage, and adjusted for clinically relevant variables, plus meat consumption (as a continuous variable, i.e., the number of medium-sized servings/week), Odc1 genotype, and a term representing the meat consumption and Odc1 genotype interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the interaction of Odc1 and meat intake on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mortality, as assessed by departures from multiplicative joint effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Odc1 genotype distribution was 51% GG, 49% GA/AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate model, there was a significant interaction between meat consumption and Odc1 genotype, P-int = 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among Odc1 GA/AA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases in meat consumption Quartiles 1-3, increased mortality risk was observed when compared to GG cases (adjusted hazards ratio (HR) = 7.06 [95% CI 2.34-21.28]) - a difference not found among cases in the highest dietary meat consumption Quartile 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Effects of meat consumption on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mortality risk differ based on genetic polymorphism at Odc1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results provide further evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> metabolism and its modulation by dietary factors such as meat may have relevance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> outcomes </plain></SENT>
