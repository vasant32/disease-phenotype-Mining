<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: 13 patients( 7 men and 6 women) with advanced, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> were treated by mFOLFOX6 regimen with first-line bevacizumab from August 2008 to July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>4 years (51 to 79 years old) with 10 and 3 patients having a PS score of 0 and 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks in association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and folinic acid according to the mFOLFOX6 regimen </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> tended to have a better response rate and disease control rate than patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may represent a prognostic factor for clinical outcome in advanced, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with first-line bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
