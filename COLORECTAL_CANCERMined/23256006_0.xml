<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The study analysed the impact of conversion of laparoscopic surgery to open resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> on short- and long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prospectively collected data of 469 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2006 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short- and long-term results were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relative frequency of conversion was 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subgroups were statistically similar regarding age, gender, body mass index (BMI), localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, T stage, and TNM stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a lower frequency of previous surgery (p = 0.018) in the group of patients with conversions to open surgery as well as statistically significantly higher frequency of patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) score II (p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference in morbidity, mortality, or the length of hospital stay between both the groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The operating time was significantly higher in the group of patients with conversion (p = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher blood loss in the patient groups with conversion to open surgery and in the group with primarily open surgery (p = 0.00023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the overall survival (p = 0.712), disease-free survival (p = 0.072) or in the local (p = 0.432) or distant (p = 0.957) recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No negative impact on short- or long-term results of conversion to open surgery was verified in patients with colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
