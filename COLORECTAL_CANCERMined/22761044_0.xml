<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the past several decades, there has been a considerable and still growing interest in discovering <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> with anticancer potential from traditional Chinese medicine and increasing their anticancer selectivity by chemical modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, total synthesis of active compounds from <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> can overcome problems related to poor resource availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DYZ-2-90 is a novel ring-opened compound modified from neo-tanshinlactone, which is isolated from Chinese medicinal herb tanshen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both in vitro and in vivo tubulin polymerization assays showed that DYZ-2-90 directly bound to microtubules and rapidly induced tubulin depolymerization, inducing ERK-mediated mitotic arrest and subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by JNK activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the fate of cells that undergo mitotic arrest is dictated by two competing networks activated by DYZ-2-90: the cytoprotective ERK pathway and the stress-related JNK pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DYZ-2-90 is therefore a novel microtubule-destabilizing agent and a new drug candidate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This paper provides a new insight into the model of mitotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which was proposed in order to elucidate how <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells respond to microtubule-interfering agents and prolonged cell cycle delay </plain></SENT>
