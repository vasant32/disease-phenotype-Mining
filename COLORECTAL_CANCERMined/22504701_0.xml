<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, emergent treatments are sometimes required because of severe adverse events associated with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We experienced a case of massive <z:mp ids='MP_0003293'>rectal hemorrhage</z:mp> during BV treatment, and interventional radiology(IVR)successfully controlled it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An 81-year-old male visited our hospital, suffering from local recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He underwent colostomy for fecal diversion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic chemotherapy with XELOX+BV was performed for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the 27th day after the first administration of BV, the patient was hospitalized because of anal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and a state of shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The colonoscopic examination showed a dimple caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage, which was closed by clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a state of shock was caused by intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> again afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The hemorrhagic point was identified as the oral side of the dimple by angiography, and coil embolization led to immediate hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The colonoscopic examination revealed nothing abnormal besides the dimple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is therefore suspected that the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0003293'>rectal hemorrhage</z:mp> might be induced by BV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During combination chemotherapy with BV, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is one of the severe adverse events requiring an emergent treatment regardless of BV dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IVR may be an effective treatment when <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> can not be controlled by endoscopic hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we should construct a system for emergency hemostasis including IVR </plain></SENT>
