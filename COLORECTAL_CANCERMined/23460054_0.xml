<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between screening colonoscopy and risk for incident late-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Nested case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Four U.S. health plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 1039 average-risk adults enrolled for at least 5 years in one of the health plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case patients were aged 55 to 85 years on their diagnosis date (reference date) of stage IIB or higher (late-stage) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during 2006 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One or 2 control patients were selected for each case patient, matched on birth year, sex, health plan, and prior enrollment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Receipt of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening 3 months to 10 years before the reference date, ascertained through medical record audits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Case patients and control patients were compared on receipt of screening colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy by using conditional logistic regression that accounted for health history, socioeconomic status, and other screening exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In analyses restricted to 471 eligible case patients and their 509 matched control patients, 13 case patients (2.8%) and 46 control patients (9.0%) had undergone screening colonoscopy, which corresponded to an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.58) for any late-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 0.36 (CI, 0.16 to 0.80) for right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and 0.26 (CI, 0.06 to 1.11; P = 0.069) for left colon/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two case patients (19.5%) and 173 control patients (34.0%) had screening sigmoidoscopy, corresponding to an AOR of 0.50 (CI, 0.36 to 0.70) overall, 0.79 (CI, 0.51 to 1.23) for right colon late-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and 0.26 (CI, 0.14 to 0.48) for left <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: The small number of screening colonoscopies affected the precision of the estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Screening with colonoscopy in average-risk persons was associated with reduced risk for diagnosis of incident late-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, including right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For sigmoidoscopy, this association was seen for left <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but the association for right colon late-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
