<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> spreads to lymph nodes via surrounding lymphatic vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Once this spread has occurred, the prognosis of the patient is significantly worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphatics are difficult to identify on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin stains and lack of specific markers has meant that little is known about their distribution in colorectal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> screening program has resulted in an increase in the diagnosis of T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with suitable T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> can avoid bowel resections and their associated morbidity with the advances in local resection techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This means, however, that formal staging and lymph node assessment cannot be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prognostic tools are required to predict risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies assessing risk of lymph node spread in T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have found that invasion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> into the deepest third of the submusosa affords a much greater risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that this might be due to the quantity or characteristics of lymphatic vasculature in this third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A specific lymphatic marker, D2-40 was applied to 5-Î¼m sections of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissue from 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Slides were scanned and analyzed using Aperio's ImageScope software for PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis boxes of fixed area were placed within the mucosal layer and within each third of the submucosal layer allowing characteristics of the lymphatics in each third to be quantified individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lymphatic vessels were found in the mucosal layer of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples although these were significantly smaller than the submucosal vessels (P = .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lymphatics were significantly more numerous in the superficial third of the submucosa (P = .0005); however, vessel size was similar in Sm1, Sm2, and Sm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The deepest third of the submucosa contains the smallest number of lymphatic vessels despite invasion into this layer being associated with a higher risk of lymph node spread </plain></SENT>
