<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to analyze the impact of cryosurgery (CRYO) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> compared to other thermoablative techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> model, evidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell spread was analyzed comparing CRYO, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an experimental study, we compared cell spillage in the washout of isolated perfused rat livers undergoing thermal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the same model, CC531-GFP rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> were treated with CRYO, RFA, or LITT and the number of vital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells within the perfusate was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) were analyzed after in vivo ablation of rat colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in the third experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our data showed pronounced washout of cells after CRYO with a higher amount of intravascular cells and cell detritus compared to RFA and LITT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the effluent fluid of cryosurgery-treated livers revealed GFP-stained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression was significantly higher after cryosurgery than after RFA and LITT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When using thermoablative techniques, intravascular metastatic cell spillage is highest in CRYO, and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases may further facilitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, RFA and LITT may be preferable whenever surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> is impossible </plain></SENT>
