<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have focused on this issue, and have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> play a crucial role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> growth and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of the enzymes involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> alterations have yet to be examined in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study focused on the expression of chondroitin-synthesizing enzymes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens from healthy controls and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were subjected to RT-PCR analysis after <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolation, and to Western blotting after sequential extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that chondroitin polymerizing factor and glucuronyltransferase gradually increased with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage, and were expressed at much higher levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> compared to adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The opposite profile was obtained for chondroitin synthase I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chondroitin synthase III was present at low levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples examined; however, its expression was higher in the samples from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients than in those from the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can therefore be concluded that, among the various factors regulating the structure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the differential expression of chondroitin-synthesizing enzymes is of the most significance </plain></SENT>
