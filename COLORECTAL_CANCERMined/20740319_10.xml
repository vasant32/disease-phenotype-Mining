<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hepatic arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33543">sulfonate</z:chebi> hydrogel microsphere (drug-eluting beads), irinotecan preloaded therapy (DEBIRI) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> refractory to systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicenter multinational single-arm study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who received DEBIRI after failing systemic chemotherapy from 10/2006 to 8/2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were safety, tolerance, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response rates, and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five patients who had received prior systemic chemotherapy and who underwent a total of 99 DEBIRI treatments were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median number of DEBIRI treatments was 2 (range 1-5), median treatment dose was 100 mg (range 100-200 mg), with total hepatic treatment of 200 mg (range 200-650 mg), with 86% of treatments performed as lobar infusion and 30% of patients treated with concurrent simultaneous chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adverse events occurred in 28% of patients with median grade of 2 (range 1-3) with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> at 30 days post procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rates were 66% at 6 months and 75% at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival in these patients was 19 months, with progression-free survival of 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic arterial drug-eluting bead, irinotecan (DEBIRI) was safe and effective in treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (MCC) refractory to multiple lines of systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DEBIRI is an acceptable therapy for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> to the liver </plain></SENT>
