<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the miRNA expression pattern and its alteration following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> intervention for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The miRNA expression profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues, matched adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosae and HT-29 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> were determined using miRNA microarray, and further confirmed using the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The target genes of the aberrant miRNAs in HT-29 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> were further assessed through bioinformatic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from this study demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of 35 miRNAs and a decrease in 30 miRNAs in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 28 aberrantly expressed miRNAs, 20 were upregulated and 8 were downregulated in the HT-29 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> compared to the matched control cells (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-552 was found to be correlated with clinical stage, lymph node and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stage and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> revealed differential expression of miR-139-3p and grade disclosed aberrant expression of miR-142-3p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, multiple target genes involved in several essential survival pathways were found be modulated by the aberrantly expressed miRNAs in HT-29 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data revealed that a common pattern of miRNA expression in the colorectum could distinguish malignant tissue from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> inhibited HT-29 cell growth in vitro which was partly attributable to the altered expression of miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>miRNAs may be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and can serve as potential therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
