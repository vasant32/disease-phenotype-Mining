<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of mechanisms was emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, therapeutic interference with the effects of BRAF mutations was repeatedly discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also reported that anti-CTLA4 antibodies provided the first treatment improving survival of patients with stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was introduced as a mechanism of resistance, particularly in lung and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, where the role of microenvironment factors was also indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo>, the use of liquid biopsies, namely, measurements of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nucleic acid in blood, were indicated as a way to obtain whole-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> assessment instead of the partial assessment obtainable with traditional biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the mechanisms of drug action and resistance was stressed to be essential for the design of new agents and combination of agents aimed at increasing antitumor effectiveness and overcoming resistance </plain></SENT>
