<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The guidelines established by the National Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Network do not describe mucinous histology as a clinical factor that should influence the therapeutic algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies show conflicting results regarding the prognosis of colorectal mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we described the clinicopathological features of mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in Japan, to identify optimal therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 144 patients with mucinous and 2673 with non-mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> who underwent primary resection in two major centers in Yokohama, Japan were retrospectively evaluated for clinicopathological features and treatment factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis for overall survival followed by the comparison of overall survival using Cox proportional hazard model were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e>, higher preoperative CEA levels, a deeper depth of invasion, higher rates of nodal and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and more metastatic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis for overall survival revealed a mucinous histology to be an independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis stratified by stage, Patients diagnosed as stageIII and IV disease had a worse survival in mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> than non-mucinous, while survival did not differ significantly in patients diagnosed as Stage0-II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In stageIII, local recurrence in rectal cases and peritoneal dissemination were more frequently observed in patients with a mucinous histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study indentified that mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was associated with a worse survival compared with non-mucinous in patients with stageIII and IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In rectal StageIII disease with mucinous histology, additional therapy to control local recurrence followed by surgical resection may be a strategical alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further molecular investigations considering genetic features of mucinous histology will lead to drug development and better management of peritoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
