<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme that mediates post-translational modification of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen known members of the PARP superfamily can be grouped into three classes based on catalytic activity: (i) classical poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerases, (ii) mono(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>‑<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26565">ribosyl</z:chebi>) transferases and (iii) catalytically inactive members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARP6 belongs to the mono(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26565">ribosyl</z:chebi>) transferase class, and here we have found that PARP6 is a negative regulator of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forced expression of PARP6 in HeLa cells induced growth suppression, but a PARP6 mutant with a C-terminal deletion lacking the catalytic domain had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PARP6-expressing cells accumulated in the S-phase, and the magnitude of S-phase accumulation was observed to be greater in cells expressing a PARP6 mutant with an N-terminal deletion, lacking a putative regulatory domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PARP6 positivity was found at higher frequencies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues with well-differentiated histology compared to those with poorly differentiated histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PARP6 positivity negatively correlated with the Ki-67 proliferation index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that PARP6-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> had a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we propose that PARP6 acts as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor through its role in cell cycle control </plain></SENT>
