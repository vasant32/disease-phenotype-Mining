<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed the present study to observe CD44s and CD44v6 expressions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and evaluate their clinical value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD44s and CD44v6 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues were examined by an immunohistochemical test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences between the CD44-positive and -negative groups were evaluated with the logrank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive rates of CD44s and CD44v6 were 66.7% and 63.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant associations between CD44s positive expression and Dukes' stage or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant associations between CD44v6 positive expression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, Dukes' stage and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rates between CD44v6-positive and CD44v6-negative groups (52.78% and 80.95%, respectively), but not between CD44s-positive and CD44s-negative groups (55.26% and 78.95%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that CD44v6 positive expression predicts a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CD44s and CD44v6 play important roles in the infiltration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CD44v6 positive expression can be a predictor for a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
