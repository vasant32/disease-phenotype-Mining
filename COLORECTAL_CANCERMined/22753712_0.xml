<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/folinic acid plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX) is a standard regimen for the chemotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major dose-limiting toxic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> is neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive effects of traditional Japanese medicines, goshajinkigan and shakuyakukanzoto on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity with FOLFOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 2006 and November 2008, a total of 44 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> received modified FOLFOX6 or FOLFOX4, as first-line chemotherapy at three institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They concurrently received either goshajinkigan (group A, n=20) or shakuyakukanzoto (group B, n=24) for neurotoxicity reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median number of treatment cycles and the median cumulative dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> were 12 cycles (range, 4-19) and 898 mg/m(2) (range, 340-1255) in group A and 10.5 cycles (range, 6-20) and 845 mg/m(2) (range, 510-1480) in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients in group A and 24 in group B received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in a cumulative dose exceeding 500 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a dose of 500 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, grade 1-2 toxicity occurred in 10 patients of group A and in 7 of group B, but there was no grade 3 or higher toxicity in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response rate of the 38 patients with measurable lesions was 50.0% (9/18) in group A and 65% (13/20) in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The administration of traditional Japanese medicine may reduce oxalipatin-induced neurotoxicity without negatively affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who undergo FOLFOX therapy </plain></SENT>
