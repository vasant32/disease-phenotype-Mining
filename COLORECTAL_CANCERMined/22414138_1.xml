<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined feasibility of the double balloon enteroscope-guided withdrawal-reinsertion method as a rescue procedure in patients with failed palliative stent placement for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small bowel obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 19 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small bowel obstruction</z:e> due to metastatic gastric (n = 15) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (n = 2), or primary small bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n = 2), in whom previous attempts to place self-expandable metal stents using conventional endoscopy had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had undergone previous gastric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After passing a guide-wire using an enteroscope with or without the double-balloon method, the enteroscope was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A conventional endoscope was re-inserted along the guide-wire, and through-the-scope self-expandable metal stent placement was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Obstruction sites were efferent jejunal loop, proximal jejunum, and third duodenal portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Technical success was achieved with 94.7% (18/19) of stents, and clinical success occurred with 84.2% (16/19) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162651" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric outlet obstruction</z:e> score (pre-procedure: 0.68 ± 0.58) increased by one week (2.05 ± 0.52, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stent migration and restenosis occurred in two (10.5%) and four (21.1%) of 19 stents, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median stent patency duration was 67 days and median survival was 93 days; these did not differ significantly by palliative chemotherapy (P = 0.76 and 0.67, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The double-balloon enteroscopy-guided method followed by conventional endoscopic self-expandable metal stent delivery was effective for rescue palliation of malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small bowel obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
