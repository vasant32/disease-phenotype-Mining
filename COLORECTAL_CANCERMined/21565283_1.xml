<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published data on this topic are inconclusive, so we conducted a population-based study in Ireland to address it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry to collect data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Ireland from 1994 to 2005 (n = 22,335) and identified those who also had IBD (n = 170) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics, treatment, and survival of patients with IBD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were compared with those of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> without IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and IBD were, on average, 7.7 years younger than those without IBD at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P = .001), and were less likely to smoke (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> in patients with IBD were stage 4 at diagnosis (12% vs 22% in non-IBD patients; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment modalities between patients with or without IBD (P = .57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with IBD was about 3 years longer than that of patients without IBD (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that IBD was not a significant prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P = .97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, older age, male sex, smoking, and advanced grade and stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were associated independently with shorter survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When propensity score matching was used to analyze outcomes, the survival times of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with and without IBD did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and IBD differ significantly from those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients without IBD, but each group of patients receive similar treatment and have similar patterns of disease progression after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
