<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present population-based study was undertaken to determine the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Kashmiri population which is non-migratory and ethnically homogeneous having stable food habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a period of one year, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed and histological proved cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible areas, where such patients are diagnosed and treated were prospectively registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 212 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were registered; of them 113 (53.3%) originated in the colon and other 99 (46.7%) in rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male to female ratio was 1.2:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 3.65/100,000; it was 3.78 in males, and 3.50/100,000 in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Muslims and Hindus were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence rate for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was highest for district Srinagar 6.19/100,000 (urban area) and lowest for district Kupwara (rural area) 1.59/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest numbers of cases were detected in the age group 55-59 years (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The age-specific rate for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was highest in the age group 55-59 years (17.21/100,000), followed by 65-69 years (14.86/100,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The age standardized incidence rate was 4.52/100,000 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The truncated age adjusted incidence rates in age group 35-64 years was 8.31/100,000; while that for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was 8.77/100,000 in males and 7.66/100,000 in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Kashmir valley is similar to that reported in the rest of India </plain></SENT>
