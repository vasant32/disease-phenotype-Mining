<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However the detection of large-scale deletions in the 3' end of the PMS2 gene has not been possible due to technical difficulties associated with pseudogene sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we utilised a recently described MLPA/long-range PCR-based approach to screen the remaining 22 % (n = 16) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-affected probands for mutations in the 3' end of the PMS2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No deletions encompassing any or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of exons 12 through 15 were identified; therefore, our results suggest that 3' deletions in PMS2 are not a frequent occurrence in such families </plain></SENT>
