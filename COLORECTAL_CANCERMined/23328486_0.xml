<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objectives: We conducted a phase II clinical trial of high-dose cetuximab plus irinotecan in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients who progressed on standard-dose cetuximab plus irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Patients who progressed within 4 weeks from receiving a minimum of 6 weeks of standard-dose cetuximab plus irinotecan were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab was administered at 500 mg/m/week and irinotecan was administered at the same dose/schedule on which each individual patient had previously progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was closed early after having met its primary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Twenty patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regimen was found to be efficacious, with 9 patients achieving disease control lasting more than 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.8 and 6.6 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The toxicity profile was favorable, with the exception of grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> which was noted in 25% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: High-dose cetuximab plus irinotecan rechallenge can re-elicit clinical benefits in patients who have previously failed cetuximab plus irinotecan treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical benefits are modest and may be related to cetuximab rechallenge rather than cetuximab dose escalation </plain></SENT>
