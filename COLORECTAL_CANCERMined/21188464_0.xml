<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We conducted a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CKD-732 [6-O-(4-dimethylaminoethoxy) cinnamoyl fumagillol hemioxalate] in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX) in nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who had progressed on irinotecan-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a dose-escalation schedule, CKD-732 doses of 2, 5, or 10 mg/m(2)/d were administered twice weekly for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (130 mg/m(2)) was administered on day 1, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (1,000 mg/m(2) twice a day) was orally administered for 14 days of a 3-week cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the group given the 10 mg/m(2)/d dose, two patients experienced dose limiting toxicities (one had grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>; the other had grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg/m(2)/d, and the clinically recommended dose was 5 mg/m(2)/d for CKD-732 in combination with XELOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequently encountered non-hematological grade 3/4 adverse events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> (22.2%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (11.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> (11.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (11.1%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (11.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration of CKD-732 increased in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no notable effects of CKD-732 on the PK of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-derived <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Phase II recommended dose of CKD-732 was determined to be 5 mg/m(2)/d, and this dose was safely combined with a conventional dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies on the effects of CKD-732 in combination with XELOX and other chemotherapies using a larger study population are warranted </plain></SENT>
