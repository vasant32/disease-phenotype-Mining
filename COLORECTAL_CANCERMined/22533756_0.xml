<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1321 colorectal ESDs were performed in 11 institutions including two Asian centers outside Japan </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar clinical results were reported in the two Asian centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences with regards to clinical results between the two periods although the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate decreased from 3.3% to 2.4% </plain></SENT>
