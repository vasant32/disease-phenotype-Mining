<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening reduces mortality yet remains underutilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low health literacy may contribute to this underutilization by interfering with patients' ability to understand and receive preventive health services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine if a web-based multimedia <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening patient decision aid, developed for a mixed-literacy audience, could increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients aged 50-74 years and overdue for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were randomized to the web-based decision aid or a control program seen immediately before a scheduled primary care appointment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A large community-based, university-affiliated internal medicine practice serving a socioeconomically disadvantaged population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients completed surveys to determine their ability to state a screening test preference and their readiness to receive screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Charts were abstracted by masked observers to determine if screening tests were ordered and completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between November 2007 and September 2008, a total of 264 patients enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data collection was completed in 2009, and data analysis was completed in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A majority of participants (mean age=57.8 years) were female (67%), African-American (74%), had annual household incomes of &lt;$20,000 (76%), and had limited health literacy (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When compared to control participants, more decision-aid participants had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening preference (84% vs 55%, p&lt;0.0001) and an increase in readiness to receive screening (52% vs 20%, p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More decision-aid participants had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests ordered (30% vs 21%) and completed (19% vs 14%), but no statistically significant differences were seen (AOR=1.6, 95% CI=0.97, 2.8, and AOR=1.7, 95% CI=0.88, 3.2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found across literacy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The web-based decision aid increased patients' ability to form a test preference and their intent to receive screening, regardless of literacy level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further study should examine ways the decision aid can be combined with additional system changes to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
