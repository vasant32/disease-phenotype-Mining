<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Accidental puncture or laceration during a surgical procedure is a patient safety indicator that is publicly reported and will factor into the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid's pay-for-performance plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accidental puncture or laceration includes serosal tear, enterotomy, and injury to the ureter, bladder, spleen, or blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify risk factors and assess surgical outcomes related to accidental puncture or laceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: This study was conducted in a single-hospital department of colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Inpatients undergoing colorectal surgery in which an accidental puncture or laceration did or did not occur were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were surgical complications, length of stay, and readmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2897 operations, 269 had accidental puncture or laceration (9.2%) including serosal tear (47%), enterotomy (38%), and extraintestinal injuries (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accidental puncture or laceration cases had more diagnoses of enterocutaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (11% vs 2%, p &lt; 0.001), reoperative cases (91% vs 61%, p &lt; 0.001), open surgery (96% vs 77%, p &lt; 0.001), longer operative times (186 vs 146 minutes, p = 0.001), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of stay (10 vs 7 days, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with serosal tears had entirely similar outcomes to those without an injury, whereas patients with enterotomies had increased operative times and length of stay, and patients with extraintestinal injuries had higher rates of reoperation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the loss of sensitivity due to grouping extraintestinal injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accidental puncture or laceration is more likely to occur in complex colorectal operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical consequences range from none to significant depending on the specific type of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To make accidental puncture or laceration a more meaningful quality indicator, we advocate that groups who use the measure eliminate the injuries that have no bearing on surgical outcome and that risk adjustment for operative complexity is performed </plain></SENT>
