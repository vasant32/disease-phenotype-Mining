<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE:: Preoperative (preop) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy (CRT) improves local control and reduces toxicity more than postoperative (postop) CRT for the treatment of stages II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, but studies suggest that many patients still receive postop CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined patient beliefs and clinical and provider characteristics associated with receipt of recommended therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: We identified stages II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients who had primary site resection and CRT among subjects in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium, a population-based and health system-based prospective cohort of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients from 2003 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient surveys and abstracted medical records were used to construct variables and determine sequence of CRT and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to model the association between predictors and receipt of preop CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Of the 201 patients, 66% received preop and 34% received postop CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those visiting a medical oncologist and/or radiation oncologist before a surgeon had a 96% (95% confidence interval, 92%-100%) predicted probability of receiving preop CRT, compared with 48% (95% confidence interval, 41%-55%) for those visiting a surgeon first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those visiting a surgeon first, documentation of recommended staging procedures was associated with receiving preop CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Sequence of provider visits and documentation of recommended staging procedures were important predictors of receiving preop CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial multidisciplinary evaluation led to better adherence to CRT guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of provider characteristics, referral patterns, and related health system processes should be undertaken to inform targeted interventions to reduce variation from recommended care </plain></SENT>
