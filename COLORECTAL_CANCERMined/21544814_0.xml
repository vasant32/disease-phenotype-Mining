<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in microsatellite repeats of 790 genes chosen based on reduced expression in MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and existence of a coding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> repeat of 6-10 bp in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the repeats were initially sequenced in 30 primary MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples and whenever frameshift mutations were identified in &gt;20%, additional 70 samples were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To distinguish driver mutations from passengers, we similarly analyzed the occurrence of frameshift mutations in 121 intronic control repeats and utilized a statistical regression model to determine cut-off mutation frequencies for repeats of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types (A/T and C/G, 6-10 bp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Along with several know target genes, including TGFBR2, ACVR2, and MSH3, six novel candidate driver genes emerged that harbored significantly more mutations than identical control repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation frequencies in 100 MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples were 51% in G8 of GLYR1, 47% in T9 of ABCC5, 43% in G8 of WDTC1, 33% in A8 of ROCK1, 30% in T8 of OR51E2, and 28% in A8 of TCEB3 </plain></SENT>
