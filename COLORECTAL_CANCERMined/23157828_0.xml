<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PCR-based direct sequencing was used to detect the mutations of KRAS gene and to correlate between clinicopathological characteristics and the presence of various KRAS mutations in 244 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutations were identified in 92 cases (37.7%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five types of mutation were detected at codon 12, including G12D (40 cases, 16.4%), G12V (16 cases, 6.6%), G12A (7 cases, 2.9%), G12S (5 cases, 2.0%) and G12C (4 cases, 1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two types of mutation were detected at codon 13, including G13D (17 cases, 7.0%) and G13C (2 cases, 0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One type of mutation was detected in codon 61, i.e. Q61K (1 case, 0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation rate was higher in females (45.6%, 36/79) than in males (32.1%, 53/165; P &lt; 0.05), but not related to another clinicopathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Female <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients have a higher KRAS mutation rate than the male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation has no significant correlation with patient's age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> gross appearance, degree of differentiation, depth of invasion, TNM stages, lymphatic invasion, abdominal or distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and prognosis in this study </plain></SENT>
