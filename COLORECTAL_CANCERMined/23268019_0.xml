<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may reduce the recurrence rate after resection of recurrent lesions by ensuring the surgical margin and controlling micro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report presents the treatment regimen and outcome of NAC for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> at this institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e>, excluding hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e>, received NAC before laparotomy between April 2005 and November 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FOLFIRI3 regimen combined with molecular targeting agents was used for NAC, and 4 to 8 courses were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laparotomy was performed during the 4-to 6-week period after the last NAC administration, and 12 courses of mFOLFOX6 were recommended as adjuvant chemotherapy after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission was observed in 1 patient and partial remission in 7 patients according to Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> ver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3, and no progressive disease was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Curative resection was achieved in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3-year overall survival rate was 83.6%, and the 3-year relapse-free survival rate was 50.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This retrospective study using a small number of subjects suggested that NAC for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> may increase the curative resection rate while reducing the recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
