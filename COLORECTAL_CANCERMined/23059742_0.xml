<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The serum levels of 13 cytokines and their relation to clinical and pathological parameters, and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> (mGPS, CRP and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio), were analysed from a prospective series of 148 CRC patients and 86 healthy age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients had higher serum platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, and IL-8 levels and lower monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) levels than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression model for discriminating the patients from the controls - including the five most predictive cytokines (high IL-8, high IL-6, low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, low IL-1ra, and low IP-10) - yielded an area under curve value of 0.890 in receiver operating characteristics analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum cytokines showed distinct correlation with other markers of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were associated with higher levels of IL-8, IL-1ra, and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A metastasised disease was accompanied by an orientation towards Th2 cytokine milieu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is associated with extensive alterations in serum cytokine environment, highlighting the importance of studying relative cytokine level alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum cytokine profile shows promise in separating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from healthy controls but its clinical value is yet to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
