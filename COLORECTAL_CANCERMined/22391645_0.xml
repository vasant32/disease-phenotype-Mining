<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Colonoscopy is the gold standard for visualization of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally accepted as a safe procedure and major adverse events occur at a low rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few data are available on structured assessment of (minor) post-procedural adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive outpatients undergoing colonoscopy were asked for permission to be called 30 days after their procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A standard telephone interview was developed to assess the occurrence of (i) major adverse events (hospital visit required), (ii) minor adverse events, and (iii) days missed from work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were further categorized in definite-, possible-, and unrelated adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were contacted between January 2010 and September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of a total of 1,528 patients who underwent colonoscopy and gave permission for a telephone call, 1,144 patients were contacted (response: 75%), 49% were male, the mean age was 59 years (s.d.: 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (3%) reported major adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These were definite-related in nine (1%) patients, possible-related in 6 (1%), and unrelated in 19 patients (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minor adverse events were reported by 466 patients (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These were definite-related in 336 patients (29%), possible-related in 36 (3%), and unrelated in the remaining 94 patients (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Female gender (odds ratio (OR): 1.5), age &lt;50 years (OR: 1.5), colonoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening/surveillance (OR: 1.6), and fellow-endoscopy (OR: 1.7) were risk factors for the occurrence of any definite-related adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients who reported definite-related adverse events were significantly less often willing to return for colonoscopy (81 vs. 88%, P&lt;0.01) and were less often positive about the entire colonoscopy experience (84 vs. 89%, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Structured assessment of post-colonoscopy adverse events shows that these are more common than generally reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Close to one-third of patients report definite-related adverse events, which are major in close to 1 in 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of adverse events does have an impact on the willingness to return for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
