<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The phase III EXTREME and CRYSTAL studies demonstrated that the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy significantly improved survival in the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the head and neck (SCCHN) and KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>), high EGFR expression was identified as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> biomarker that can predict survival benefit associated with the addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> EGFR expression level was predictive of cetuximab benefit in EXTREME and CRYSTAL study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospectively collected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> immunohistochemistry data were used to generate an EGFR immunohistochemistry score (scale 1-300) for patients in the EXTREME and CRYSTAL studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each study, the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> immunohistochemistry score and cetuximab benefit was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EXTREME and CRYSTAL studies are registered with Clinical Trials.gov, numbers NCT00122460 and NCT00154102, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> EGFR immunohistochemistry data were available for 411 of 442 (93%) patients from the EXTREME study intention-to-treat (ITT) population and 664 of 666 (100%) patients from the ITT population of the CRYSTAL study with EGFR-expressing, KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of immunohistochemistry scores was similar between the treatment arms of each study, but differed between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A clinically relevant benefit for progression-free and overall survival associated with the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy was seen across the full score range in EXTREME study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, CRYSTAL study patients derived a clinical benefit across the full score range, with no meaningful association between EGFR expression level and benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy improved survival in the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic SCCHN and KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mCRC regardless of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> EGFR expression level, indicating that in contrast to findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>, EGFR expression level is not a clinically useful predictive biomarker in these settings </plain></SENT>
