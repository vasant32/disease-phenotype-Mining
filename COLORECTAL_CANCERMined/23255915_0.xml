<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> are considered to progress by <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> (CIN), or microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or epigenetic gene silencing; however, in previous studies we observed a small fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> without this molecular phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate these 'X-type' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, neoplastic glands from five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were isolated by laser-capture microdissection and used for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA from our own low-passage primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines (n=9) was used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these 'X-type' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> had very low numbers of aberrations (totals of four and five, respectively), consisting of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> and arm amplifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, aberrations were markedly more frequent in the control cases and three of the 'X-type' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (range, 11-40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These aberrations included deletions of chromosomes and chromosome arms, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> (UPD), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> and arm amplifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrent microdeletions (&lt;1 MB) were observed at 3p14.2 (FHIT), 16p13.2 (A2BP1) and 20p12.1 (MACROD2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analyses with polymorphic markers at five 'canonical' colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> loci demonstrated a complete loss of one allele in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared to the SNP arrays, concordant results were observed in 93% of tests; however, this was only if DNA from cell lines or laser-capture microdissections was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> may develop without the classic molecular features of CIN, MSI and/or CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), but this is a rare event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UPD is frequent but does not define a separate molecular phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our study supports the notion that SNP arrays are reliable for genome-wide detection of deletions and UPD, but discourages the use of microsatellite analyses to detect loss of heterozygosity with DNA from whole tissues </plain></SENT>
