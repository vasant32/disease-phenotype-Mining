<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rapidly advancing technology has resulted in the generation of the genomic sequences of several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified several mutations of the DNA polymerase β (pol β) gene in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that the expression of the pol β G231D variant increased chromosomal aberrations and induced cellular transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transformed phenotype persisted in the cells even once the expression of G231D was extinguished, suggesting that it resulted as a consequence of genomic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis revealed that its catalytic rate was 140-fold slower than WT pol β, and this was a result of the decreased binding affinity of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> by G231D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Residue 231 of pol β lies in close proximity to the template strand of the DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular modeling demonstrated that the change from a small and nonpolar glycine to a negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> resulted in a repulsion between the template and residue 231 leading to the distortion of the dNTP binding pocket </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression of G231D was insufficient to rescue pol β-deficient cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents suggesting that these agents may be effectively used to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> harboring this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly, this suggests that the G231D variant has impaired base excision repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these data indicate that the G231D variant plays a role in driving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
