<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the variation in risk-adjusted 30-day postoperative mortality for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between hospital trusts within the English NHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional population-based study of data extracted from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Data Repository </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> providers of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery within the English NHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 160,920 individuals who underwent major resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed between 1998 and 2006 in the English NHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures National patterns of 30-day postoperative mortality were examined and logistic binary regression was used to study factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Funnel plots were used to show variation between trusts in risk-adjusted mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 6.7% but decreased over time from 6.8% in 1998 to 5.8% in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The largest reduction in mortality was seen in 2005 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality increased with age (15.0% (95% CI 14.1% to 15.9%) for those aged &gt;80 years), comorbidity (24.2% (95% CI 22.0% to 26.5%) for those with a Charlson comorbidity score â‰¥ 3), stage of disease (9.9% (95% CI 9.3% to 10.6%) for patients with Dukes' D disease), socioeconomic deprivation (7.8% (95% CI 7.2% to 8.4%) for residents of the most deprived quintile) and operative urgency (14.9% (95% CI 14.2% to 15.7%) for patients undergoing emergency resection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk-adjusted control charts showed that one trust had consistently significantly better outcomes and three had significantly worse outcomes than the population mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Significant variation in 30-day postoperative mortality following major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery existed between NHS hospitals in England throughout the period 1998-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Understanding the underlying causes of this variation between surgical providers will make it possible to identify and spread best practice, improve outcomes and, ultimately, reduce 30-day postoperative mortality following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
