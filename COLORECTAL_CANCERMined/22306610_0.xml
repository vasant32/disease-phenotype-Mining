<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that spontaneous loss of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> in the colon results in DNA damage accumulation and aberrant DNA damage responses that may contribute to the increased genomic instability and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We find greater than 2-fold changes in the expression of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-absorption and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> retention genes within the colonocyte, demonstrating that with age the colon is able to induce expression of appropriate genes in response to limiting <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, we also find that aging results in spontaneous accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> in colon DNA, indicating that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> status is not fully restored by the increase in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>-excising enzymes (Ung and Smug) are induced in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> accumulation, and with age we see an approximate 3-fold increase in the level of expression that is matched by a corresponding increase in DNA polymerase Î² expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In further evaluating the DNA damage response, we investigated p53 localization and function and find abundant p53 levels, with p53 sequestered almost entirely in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine whether cytoplasmic localization might impact p53 transactivation function, we conducted an unbiased screen of p53-target genes and found that age substantially alters expression of p53-target genes </plain></SENT>
