<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of DM on stages and outcomes among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study enrolled 945 patients who were diagnosed as having colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> from August 1994 to December 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the cohort, 26 patients were diagnosed as having DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 45.8 months, differences in overall survival and disease-free survival between the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> groups were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Kaplan and Meier analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the two groups in overall survival rates at 3 years or 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, patients with DM, compared with patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, experienced a significantly lower disease-free survival rate (34.2% diabetics vs. 55.1% non-diabetics; P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DM was associated with an increased risk of recurrence in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
