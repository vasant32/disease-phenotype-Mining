<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene SMAD4 (DPC4) encodes for the common intracellular mediator of the TGF-Î² superfamily pathway, which regulates numerous cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell fate and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the presence of genetic variants in SMAD4 gene promoter in malignant pancreatic and colorectal tissue and to analyze their functional consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was performed on genomic DNA isolated from malignant tissue samples obtained on surgery from 50 patients with pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening for mutations within an 800bp-long fragment of the SMAD4 gene promoter was performed by DNA sequencing and two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> repeats, at positions -462 and -4, were found to be polymorphic in malignant tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exact number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidines</z:chebi> in the tracts -462T(15) and -4T(12) was determined by PCR with fluorescently labeled primers followed by capillary electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of -462T(15)/-4T(12) haplotypes was performed by luciferase reporter assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Haplotype -462T(14)/-4T(10) was found in 85% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> tissues, but it was not present in any of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant reduction (p&lt;0.001) in activity was observed in the haplotype -462T(14)/-4T(10) in comparison with the haplotypes -462T(15)/-4T(12) and -462T(14)/-4T(11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results of this study indicate that novel genetic variant -4T(10) in the SMAD4 gene promoter affects its activity and that element -4T(12) may play a role in transcriptional regulation of SMAD4 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Obtained results, though preliminary, also indicate that SMAD4 gene promoter haplotype -462T(14)/-4T(10) may represent a genetic marker of potential relevance for pancreatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study should be confirmed by further investigation in these two and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, on larger number of patients and with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Translational research aimed at investigating potential application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> repeats -462T(15) and -4T(12) in SMAD4 gene promoter as molecular markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> may also prove useful </plain></SENT>
