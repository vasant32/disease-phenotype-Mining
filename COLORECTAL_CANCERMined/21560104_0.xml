<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In Germany, approximately 70.000 people are diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> every year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With early diagnosis the recovery rates are over 90 % and early intervention can significantly reduce the costs of medical treatment as well as the economic losses from worker productivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here present the organisational procedure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> screening and have weighed the costs against benefits to employees, the company and the healthcare system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The screening costs are compared with economic benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The target group for the study consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11.536 employees at the company's site in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Volunteers were given a standardized questionnaire about the risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and an immunological fecal occult blood test (IFOBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If risk factors for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were present or if the test result was positive, a colonoscopy was recommended in accordance with DGVS guidelines (German Society of Digestive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic diseases</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 4.287 employees (37.2 %) indicated an interest in undergoing screening; at the end of the period 3.958 complete datasets (2.296 men and 1.662 women, mean age 51.2 years) were available for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A colonoscopy was performed on 114 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six cases of overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were detected with three in the 36 - 50 age group and three in the 51 - 65 age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five of the six cases were stage T1 or T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>Adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> were found and removed in 29 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The calculated cost benefit ratio was 1:2 for the company and 1:35 for the public health system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using the example of colorectal screening, this study represents a cost benefit analysis of this preventative health measure in a company environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results show that even while taking into account the financial and personal commitment required, the cost benefit ratio is positive both for the company and for the healthcare system </plain></SENT>
