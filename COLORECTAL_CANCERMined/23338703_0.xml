<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After four rounds of panning, four phage clones that bound specifically to the Caco-2 cells were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phage clone SP-2 had a particularly high affinity and specificity for Caco-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This clone was identified using a series of methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> SP-2 that was displayed on phage SP-2 exhibited a high specificity to Caco-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> SP-2 could be a candidate probe for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
