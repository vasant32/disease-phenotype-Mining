<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A subset of aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> exhibit BRAF mutation, MLH1 methylation and a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), but precursors are poorly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the status of these markers in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and evaluated associated risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 932 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> cases and 1,027 controls who were ages 24-80, part of a group health program, received a colonoscopy from 1998-2007 and completed a structured questionnaire assessing risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following standard pathology review, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were assayed for BRAF mutation (V600E) and tested for MLH1 and CIMP methylation, the latter including the genes CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between molecularly-defined subsets of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and potential risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>580 conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 419 serrated lesions were successfully assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, the prevalence of each marker was ≤1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 55% of serrated lesions harbored mutant BRAF, 26% were CIMP-high and 5% had methylated MLH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these lesions, the highest prevalence of markers was in sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (SSPs) of ≥10 mm that localized to right-sided/cecal regions of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for CIMP-high serrated lesions included Caucasian race, current smoking status and a history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, whereas for serrated lesions with mutant BRAF the significant risk factors were male sex, current smoking status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and a history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that SSPs and other large, right-sided serrated lesions have a unique molecular profile that is similar to CIMP-high, BRAF-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
