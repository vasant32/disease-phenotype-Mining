<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, resistance to this drug is relatively frequent, and new strategies to overcome it are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to determine the antitumor properties of a supercritical fluid rosemary extract (SFRE), alone and in combination with 5-FU, as a potential adjuvant therapy useful for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This extract has been recognized as a healthy component by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of SFRE both alone and in combination with 5-FU were evaluated in different human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells in terms of cell viability, cytotoxicity, and cell transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells resistant to 5-FU were used to assay the effects of SFRE on drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, qRT-PCR was performed to ascertain the mechanism by which SFRE potentiates the effect of 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that SFRE displays dose-dependent antitumor activities and exerts a synergistic effect in combination with 5-FU on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SFRE sensitizes 5-FU-resistant cells to the therapeutic activity of this drug, constituting a beneficial agent against both 5-FU sensitive and resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis indicates that the enhancement of the effect of 5-FU by SFRE might be explained by the downregulation of TYMS and TK1, enzymes related to 5-FU resistance </plain></SENT>
