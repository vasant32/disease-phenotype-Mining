<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The best cure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) lies on its early diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to provide the epidemiological features of advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (A-CRA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in symptomatic patients and to determine whether the incidences of A-CRA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> increased simultaneously in China between 1990 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 157,943 patients who had undergone a colonoscopy from 1990 to 2009 were enrolled, of which 6,777 patients had A-CRA and 3,503 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were compared with controls in a stratified analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The detection rates of A-CRA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the 1990s and 2000s were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The detection rate of A-CRA increased 1.88-fold over the two decades, while that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> increased 0.66-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentages of patients with A-CRA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who were elder than 50 years were significantly higher in the 2000s than those in the 1990s (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes of location of A-CRA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during the two decades indicated a shift of lesions from the distal colon to proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in detection rate of A-CRA in the 2000s, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> did not increase at a similar speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that the early detection and removal of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in symptomatic patients might decrease the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
