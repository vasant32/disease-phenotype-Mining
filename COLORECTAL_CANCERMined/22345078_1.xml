<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rac1b is an alternatively spliced isoform of the small GTPase Rac1 that includes the 57-nucleotide exon 3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rac1b was originally identified through its over-expression in breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, and has subsequently been implicated as a key player in a number of different oncogenic signaling pathways, including tumorigenic transformation of mammary epithelial cells exposed to matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although many of the cellular consequences of Rac1b activity have been recently described, the molecular mechanism by which MMP-3 treatment leads to Rac1b induction has not been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we use proteomic methods to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 as a factor involved in Rac1 splicing regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that hnRNP A1 binds to Rac1 exon 3b in mouse mammary epithelial cells, repressing its inclusion into mature <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also find that exposure of cells to MMP-3 leads to release of hnRNP A1 from exon 3b and the consequent generation of Rac1b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we analyze <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breast tissue and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> biopsies, and identify an inverse correlation between expression of hnRNP A1 and Rac1b, suggesting the existence of this regulatory axis in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide new insights on how extracellular signals regulate alternative splicing, contributing to cellular transformation and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
