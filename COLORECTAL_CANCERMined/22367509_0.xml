<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of STAT5a in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We inhibited the expression of STAT5a using lentivirus-mediated artificial microRNA (miRNA) interference in vitro and investigated the viability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells by CCK-8 assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed the cell viability after treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> (CDDP) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-Fu) by CCK-8 assay, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by chemotherapy using flow cytometric analysis and Annexin V <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> staining assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We inhibited the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by 54% and the protein expression by 60% of STAT5 by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference targeting STAT5a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell viability assays showed that inhibition of STAT5a did not affect the viability of SW1116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we found that inhibition of STAT5a restored the sensitivity of SW1116 cells to CDDP and 5-Fu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In additional experiments, we found that inhibition of STAT5a significantly promoted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by CDDP and 5-Fu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that inhibition of STAT5a promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells induced by chemotherapy drugs, such as CDDP or 5-Fu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inhibition of STAT5a may serve as a potential new target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
