<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a driving force during initiation and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, the Wnt/β-catenin targets CDX1, EPHB2, EPHB3 and EPHB4 (EPHB2-4) act as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors in intestinal epithelial cells and frequently appear to be transcriptionally silenced in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms which underlie the apparent loss of expression of a subset of Wnt/β-catenin targets in a background of persistent pathway activity are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into this, we quantified expression of CDX1 and EPHB2-4 in human tissue specimens of case-matched colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular EPHB2-4 display biphasic, albeit not strictly coincident, expression profiles with elevated levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and decreased transcription in approximately 30% of the corresponding <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with their divergent and variable expression we observed considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among the epigenetic landscapes at CDX1 and EPHB2-4 in a model of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike the inactive CDX1 locus, EPHB2-4 maintain DNA hypomethylation of their promoter regions in the silent state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strong reduction of active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications consistently parallels reduced expression of CDX1 and EPHB3 and to some extent of EPHB2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, treatment with inhibitors for DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylases (HDACs) restored CDX1 and EPHB2-4 expression depending upon epigenetic features at their promoters but also upon cellular background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall our findings show that downregulation of CDX1 and EphB receptor genes occurs independently and that different branches of epigenetic control systems including class I and III HDACs contribute to epigenetic silencing of Wnt/β-catenin targets during colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
