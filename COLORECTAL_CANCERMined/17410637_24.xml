<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the impact of surgeon volume and specialization on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> resection rate, restoration of bowel continuity following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> resection, anastomotic leakage and perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Northern Region <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Audit Group conducts a population-based audit of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> managed by surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined 8219 patients treated between 1998 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were modelled using multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> resection was performed in 6949 (93.8 per cent) of 7411 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-volume surgeons with an annual caseload of at least 18.5 (odds ratio (OR) 1.53 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 1.10 to 2.12); P = 0.012) and colorectal specialists (OR 1.42 (95 per cent c.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1.06 to 1.90); P = 0.018) were more likely to perform elective sphincter-saving rectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In elective surgery, the risk of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was lower for high-volume surgeons (OR 0.58 (95 per cent c.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>0.44 to 0.76); P &lt; 0.001), but this was not the case in emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-volume surgeons had lower perioperative mortality rates for elective surgery, and were more likely to use restorative rectal procedures </plain></SENT>
