<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate overall survival after radioembolization or best supportive care (BSC) in patients with chemotherapy-refractory liver-dominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a matched-pair comparison of patients who received radioembolization plus BSC or BSC alone for extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients who received radioembolization were retrospectively matched with a contemporary cohort of &gt;500 patients who received BSC from 3 centers in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using clinical databases, patients were initially matched for prior treatments and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and then 29 patients were consecutively identified with two or more of four matching criteria: synchronous/metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden, increased ALP, and/or CEA &gt;200 U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival was calculated from date of progression before radioembolization or BSC by using Kaplan-Meier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 29 patients in each study arm, 16 pairs (55.2%) matched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four criteria, and 11 pairs (37.9%) matched three criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups had a similar performance status (Karnofsky index, median 80% [range, 60-100%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with BSC alone, radioembolization prolonged survival (median, 8.3 vs. 3.5 months; P &lt; 0.001) with a hazard ratio of 0.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.55; P &lt; 0.001) in a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related adverse events following radioembolization included: grade 1-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (n = 20, 69%), grade 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (n = 14, 48.3%), and grade 2 gastrointestinal ulceration (n = 3, 10.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">grade 3 radiation</z:e>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> were symptomatically managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radioembolization offers a promising addition to BSC in treatment-refractory patients for whom there are limited options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival was prolonged and adverse events were generally mild-to-moderate in nature and manageable </plain></SENT>
