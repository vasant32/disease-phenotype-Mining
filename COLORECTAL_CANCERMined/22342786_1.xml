<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> from appendiceal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) shows great promise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although long-term disease-free survival is achieved in some cases with this procedure, many patients have recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oncologists have treated such recurrences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0496779" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">appendiceal cancer</z:e> similarly to colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, which has been largely ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study uses gene expression analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> to better understand these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: From a prospectively maintained database and tissue bank, 41 snap frozen samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> (26 appendiceal, 15 colorectal) from patients undergoing HIPEC with complete cytoreduction and more than 3 years of follow-up underwent global gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distinct phenotypes were identified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on differential gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival curves restratified by genotype were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three distinct phenotypes were found, 2 consisting of predominantly low grade appendiceal samples (10 of 13 in Cluster 1 and 15 of 20 in Cluster 2) and 1 consisting of predominantly colorectal samples (7 of 8 in Cluster 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cluster 1 consisted of patients with good prognosis and Clusters 2 and 3 consisted of patients with poor prognosis (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Signatures predicted survival of low- (Cluster 1) vs high-risk (Cluster 2) appendiceal (p = 0.04) and low-risk appendiceal (Cluster 1) vs colon primary (Cluster 3) (p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first use of gene expression profiling for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0496779" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">appendiceal cancer</z:e>, and demonstrates genomic signatures quite distinct from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, confirming their unique biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, therapy for appendiceal lesions extrapolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> regimens may be unfounded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These phenotypes may predict outcomes guiding patient management </plain></SENT>
