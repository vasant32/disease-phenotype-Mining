<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the role of a fifth-year surveillance Computed Tomography (CT) scan in detecting recurrence in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had undergone potentially curative resections of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> between 2003 and 2004 was performed using electronic and casenote records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and GnuPSPP statistical software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and seven patients (111 male and 96 female) with a median age of 74 years (IQR 66-80) undergoing colorectal resections were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-one patients (58%) were alive and disease free at 5 years of whom 81 (67%) had received a fifth-year surveillance CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifth-year scanning did not demonstrate any new colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However 6 (7%) scans revealed new, undiagnosed, non-colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were diagnosed by 3Â½ years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these 34 cases presented after their second-year surveillance CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Those patients with asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> at the time of their discovery demonstrated improved likelihood of five year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed no role for a fifth-year surveillance CT scan in the detection of resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, however there was a 7% pick up rate for detecting new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CT scanning beyond 2 years was needed to identify about one-third of the recurrences reported in this study </plain></SENT>
