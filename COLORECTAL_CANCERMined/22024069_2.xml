<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this small retrospective institutional study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the continuation of BV in combination with various chemotherapeutic agents, within the framework of multiple line therapy in progressed mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Our retrospective study included 21 patients with mCRC that had received at least one course of irinotecan-based or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy with BV before disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BV treatment was continuously dispensed after disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis was performed in terms of age, site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, spread and co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) was 23+ months (range 4-51 months) with no statistically significant differences between the aforementioned subgroups of patients, except from the subgroup according to spread (p=0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time to progression was 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades) was reported in 33.3% of the patients, while <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were reported in 28.6% and 14.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiple line treatment in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, including BV combined with standard chemotherapy, may improve OS with an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with mCRC after disease progression </plain></SENT>
