<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (CRAC) is exceedingly rare in the pediatric population (fewer than 2 cases per 1 million children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are 2 major categories of pediatric colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> syndromes: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e>-related and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333990" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</z:e>, also known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Germ line mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (eg, MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6) have been established as the molecular genetic basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another prognostic factor in adult CRAC is the reduced expression of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), which has been associated with poor outcome in some adult CRAC cases; however, its role in predicting prognoses in pediatric cases remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven pediatric patients with primary CRAC were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Available molecular genetic test results were evaluated, and immunohistochemical labeling for MMR proteins and E-cadherin were performed on 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the 5 patients in our study with available paraffin blocks showed loss of MMR protein expression, consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases stained for E-cadherin, 3 were strongly positive and 2 were weakly positive; however, with the small sample size and the relatively short follow-up period, an accurate correlation between E-cadherin and prognosis cannot be reached with any degree of certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight the importance of genetic testing for MMR gene mutations in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and suggest further investigation into the prognostic role of E-cadherin in pediatric CRAC </plain></SENT>
