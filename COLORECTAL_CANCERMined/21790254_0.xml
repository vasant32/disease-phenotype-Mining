<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from Tunisia are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we analyzed trends in incidence rates of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> over a 15-year period, 1993-2007, in Central Tunisia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Five-year age-specific rates, crude incidence rates, world age-standardized rates, and annual percent change were calculated using annual data on population size and its estimated age structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,443 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were registered, with a male to-female sex ratio of 1.1:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The world age-standardized rate was 10.0 per 100,000 among females and 11.7 among males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over time, there were significant increasing trends by +2.6% (95% CI: 0.1%, 5.1%) and +5.3% (95% CI: 2.7%, 7.9%) for females and males, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The absence of a screening program for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> could explain the increasing trends observed among males and females in Central Tunisia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings point the need to plan and develop effective programs aimed at the control and prevention of the spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Tunisia </plain></SENT>
