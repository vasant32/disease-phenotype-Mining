<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A close link between the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltrating lymphocytes and prognosis has been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, recent studies have shattered our dogmas as the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltrating lymphocytes seems to be a better prognostic factor than TNM classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review is focused on immune response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific cell-mediated immunity is important for the control of tumoral growth </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the numerous tumoral antigens that could induce an immune response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the carcinoembryonic antigen is the most studied but its immunogenicity remains low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with microsatellite instability, several immunogenic neo-antigens have been identified and could explain the high level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltrating lymphocytes and the better prognosis of this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> can escape immune response by immune response modulation or tumoral cells modifications conducting to immune resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data should be considered for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or the development of immunotherapy strategies </plain></SENT>
