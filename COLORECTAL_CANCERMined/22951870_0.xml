<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare physicians' communication with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> patients vs. non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> patients, assess whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> family history were associated with physician-patient communication, and describe patients' disclosure of colonoscopy and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> diagnosis to their relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred nine patients completed an online survey regarding physician-patient communication of colonoscopy results, perceived personal and familial risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and disclosure of colonoscopy results to relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six percent of participants reported that their physicians discussed familial risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyp</z:mpath> diagnosis and family history predicted physician-patient discussions about familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyp</z:mpath> diagnosis predicted physician-patient discussions of future surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two percent of patients told none of their relatives that they had a colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Family history, gender, and education were associated with patient-family communication </plain></SENT>
