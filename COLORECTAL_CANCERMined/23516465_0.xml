<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to assess the health preference and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (CRN), and to determine the clinical correlates that significantly influence the HRQOL of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred and fifty-four CRN patients, inclusive of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, who attended the colorectal specialist outpatient clinic at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between October 2009 and July 2010, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were interviewed with questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics, and generic and health preference measures of HRQOL using the SF-12 and SF-6D Health Surveys, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical information on stage of disease at diagnosis, time since diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> site was extracted from electronic case record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean HRQOL and health preference scores of CRN patients were compared with age-sex matched controls from the Chinese general population using independent t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations of clinical characteristics with HRQOL measures with the adjustment of socio-demographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cross-sectional data of 515 eligible patients responded to the whole questionnaires were included in outcome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with age-sex matched normative values, CRN patients reported comparable physical-related HRQOL but better mental-related HRQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Amongst CRN patients, time since diagnosis was positively associated with health preference score whilst patients with rectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> had lower health preference and physical-related HRQOL scores than those with sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Health preference and HRQOL scores were significantly lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> than those with other less severe stages, indicating that progressive decline from low-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> was observed in HRQOL scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In CRN patients, a more advanced stage of disease was associated with worse HRQOL scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite potentially adverse effect of disease on physical-related HRQOL, the mental-related HRQOL of CRN patients were better than that of Chinese general population </plain></SENT>
