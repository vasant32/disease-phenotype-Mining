<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who seek to improve their knowledge of health and treatment options can now access in a few seconds data that would previously have required hours of research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the attitudes of patients toward Web browsing for information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We surveyed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients attending a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> follow-up clinic between January and August 2007 on their use of the Internet to obtain information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 439 patients with mean age of 68.6 years participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 24% reported using the Internet to obtain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most participants used the Google search engine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 13% of participants confirmed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> information on the Internet was helpful in decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients under the age of 65 years were more likely to have Internet access (p &lt; 0.001), more likely to use the Internet to find <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> information (p = 0.005) and more likely to access a site recommended by a colorectal specialist (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among Internet users, men were slightly more likely than women to use the Internet, although the difference was not significant (p = 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Internet is a useful tool for disseminating information about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best sites are still difficult for patients to distinguish from the thousands of sites returned by search engines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the level of potential interest is sufficient to justify the development of a departmental or regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> network of websites and indicates areas of interest for patients </plain></SENT>
