<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify a new plasma biomarker for use in early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the combination of hollow fiber membrane (HFM)-based low-molecular weight protein enrichment and two-dimensional image converted analysis of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (2DICAL), we compared the plasma proteome of 22 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with those of 21 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An identified biomarker candidate was then validated in two larger cohorts [validation-1 (n = 210) and validation-2 (n = 113)] using a high-density reverse-phase protein microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a total of 53,009 mass peaks, we identified 103 with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.80 or higher that could distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A peak that increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, with an AUC of 0.81 and P value of 0.0004 (Mann-Whitney U test), was identified as a product of the PLIN2 gene [also known as perilipin-2, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), or adipophilin] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in plasma adipophilin was consistently observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, including those with stage I or stage II disease (P &lt; 0.0001, Welch's t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that adipophilin is expressed primarily in the basal sides of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells forming polarized tubular structures, and that it is absent from adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adipophilin is a plasma biomarker potentially useful for the detection of early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: The combination of HFM and 2DICAL enables the comprehensive analysis of plasma proteins and is ideal for use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biomarker discovery studies </plain></SENT>
