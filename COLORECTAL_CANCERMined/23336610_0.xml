<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) for in vivo diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) compared with conventional histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients underwent CLE examination for screening or surveillance colonoscopy were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Suspected malignant lesions and adjacent mucosal sites were first examined by confocal imaging, and then the specimens of these sites were obtained using biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confocal images were independently interpreted by two endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis made with CLE was compared with the conventional histologic diagnosis in a prospective and blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one patients with suspected malignant lesions were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 74 lesions and 92 adjacent mucosal sites were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CLE in diagnosis of invasive growth <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 97.1%, 99.0% and 98.2% for endoscopist A, and 98.6%, 96.9% and 97.6% for endoscopist B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interobserver agreement between the two endoscopists was excellent (Îº = 0.950) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The accuracy in diagnosing poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using CLE was 97.0% for endoscopist A and 95.6% for endoscopist B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CLE has the potential to enable an immediate diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the degree of differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during ongoing endoscopy in vivo </plain></SENT>
