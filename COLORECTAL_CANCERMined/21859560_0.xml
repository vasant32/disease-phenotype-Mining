<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As of 2006, bevacizumab was available for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) in British Columbia (BC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compares survival between referred patients diagnosed with mCRC in 2003/2004 (pre-bevacizumab era) and 2006 (bevacizumab era) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The BC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> agency (BCCA) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> network treating approximately 60% of patients with mCRC in BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the BCCA diagnosed with mCRC in 2003/2004 and 2006 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One thousand four hundred seventeen patients were included: 969 from 2003/2004, and 448 from 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between 2003/2004 and 2006, the proportion of patients treated with systemic therapy for mCRC increased (61.1% to 67.6%; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant difference in treatment between the cohorts was in the proportion of patients who received bevacizumab (5.9% to 30.6%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median OS significantly differed between the 2 cohorts (13.8 to 17.3 months; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median OS for patients who received systemic therapy increased (18.6-23.6 months; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median OS for patients who did not receive systemic therapy was unchanged (6.1-5.9 months; P = .65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this population-based study, median OS for mCRC significantly increased between 2003/2004 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An increase in the proportion of patients treated with systemic therapy, and the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy, seem to have contributed to this improvement in survival </plain></SENT>
