<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent clinical trials found an association between KRAS mutation status and resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy, leading to the recommendation to perform KRAS mutation analysis before cetuximab or panitumumab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to compare and evaluate the efficacy of four different methodologies--high resolution melting, Sanger sequencing, DxS kit, and SNaPshot--for KRAS mutation detection in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 372 samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were analyzed by high resolution melting and SNaPshot, with 184 of those being further analyzed by Sanger sequencing and 188 with the DxS kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivities were compared after consensus findings were determined by the presence of the same result in two of the three methodologies used in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations in our population was 43.5%, and a discordant finding was observed in 22 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing to Sanger sequencing, significantly more consensus mutations were detected by the DxS kit (P=0.0139), high resolution melting (P=0.0004), and SNaPshot (P=0.00001), but no statistically significant differences were found among the three methodologies with higher sensitivity </plain></SENT>
