<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is variable in Dukes' B, so the aim of this study was to determine whether or not SAC has a poor prognosis in Dukes' B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised 64 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook a statistical analysis of the association of SAC and non-SAC with sex, age, histologic type, depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, venous invasion and lymphatic invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SACs were encountered in 17.5% of cases (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SAC had a less favorable 5-year survival than non-SAC (p = 0.0396 log-rank, Kaplan-Meier) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The factors that achieved statistical significance in the univariate analysis were subsequently included in a multivariate analysis and we found that SAC was an independent factor (p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SAC has a poor prognosis and is not affected by other factors confirming that SAC is an independently less favorable prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
