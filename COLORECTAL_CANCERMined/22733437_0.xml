<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Research for reliable and patient-specific markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is based on solid evidence that staging alone is not informative enough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Employing four cellular receptors, we embarked to identify aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> behaviour and impact of surrogate marker expression on patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-hundred eighty-three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were enrolled in our investigation that focused on an array of biological markers, namely epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-Met, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase (FAK) and CD44v6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples, clinicopathological data and patient's follow-up information were collected, and immunohistochemical assays evaluated the levels of the aforementioned molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> available data were correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> grade, stage, patient age, gender and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> receptors correlated closely with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage (P &lt; 0.01) exhibiting a connection with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>'s invasiveness and progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival also proved to depend significantly on molecular expression (log-rank test for Kaplan-Meier; EGFR P = 0.030, c-Met P = 0.050, FAK P &lt; 0.001, CD44v6 P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stage, FAK and CD44v6 emerged as independent predictors of survival in a stepwise regression analysis (FAK P = 0.001 Exp(B) = 2.517, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.704-5.831 and CD44v6 P = 0.005, Exp(B) = 2.299, 95 % CI = 1.287-4.110) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-stage, nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metastatic types (N/M) and size correlated with at least one of the receptors or their co-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, increased staining for each receptor was followed by statistically significant expression elevation of at least one of the other markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the selected cellular receptors are suitable for use as biomarkers of survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we provide additional evidence for receptor interaction, properly clarifying their importance, which could potentially lead to more effective anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> regimens </plain></SENT>
