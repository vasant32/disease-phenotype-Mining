<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy response rates for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remain disappointingly low, primarily because of drug resistance, so there is an urgent need to improve current treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify novel determinants of resistance to the clinically relevant drugs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and SN38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), transcriptional profiling experiments were carried out on pretreatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> biopsies and HCT116 parental and chemotherapy-resistant cell line models using a disease-specific DNA microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To enrich for potential chemoresistance-determining genes, an unsupervised bioinformatics approach was used, and 50 genes were selected and then functionally assessed using custom-designed short interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) screens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the primary siRNA screen, silencing of 21 genes sensitized HCT116 cells to either 5-FU or SN38 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three genes (RAPGEF2, PTRF, and SART1) were selected for further analysis in a panel of 5 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Silencing SART1 sensitized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 cell lines to 5-FU treatment and 4/5 cell lines to SN38 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, silencing of RAPGEF2 or PTRF had no significant effect on 5-FU or SN38 sensitivity in the wider cell line panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further functional analysis of SART1 showed that its silencing induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> that was caspase-8 dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, silencing of SART1 led to a downregulation of the caspase-8 inhibitor, c-FLIP, which we have previously shown is a key determinant of drug resistance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study shows the power of systems biology approaches for identifying novel genes that regulate drug resistance and identifies SART1 as a previously unidentified regulator of c-FLIP and drug-induced activation of caspase-8 </plain></SENT>
