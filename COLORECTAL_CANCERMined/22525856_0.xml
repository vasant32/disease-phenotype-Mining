<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A CRR is sometimes defined as a locoregional recurrence (LR) and sometimes as a lymph node recurrence (NR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine the nature of CRR and evaluate prognostic factors after complete CRR resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1988 and December 2008, 31 patients underwent a complete resection of CRR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CRRs were divided into NR (n = 23) and LR (n = 8), whether pathological examination disclosed lymph node involvement or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences were found between LR and NR regarding TNM stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> location, time interval from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> resection to CRR, number of metastatic sites, number of metastatic lesions and therapeutic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median preoperative CEA level was higher in the NR group (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 47 months NRs were associated with better overall survival (OS) (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) in the LR and NR groups were 27% and 0% versus 81% and 26%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (87%) patients developed a re-recurrence within a median interval of 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of metastatic sites or lesions, the size of the CRR, the type of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, the interval between the primary resection and CRR and the TNM stage had no impact on OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LR in patients with CRR had a poorer prognosis than NR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A multimodality approach with complete resection may yield long-term survival for NR </plain></SENT>
