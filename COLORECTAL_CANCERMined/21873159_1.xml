<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Oncogenic KRAS plays several key roles in a three-dimensional (3D) colonic-crypt model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, miRNA expression regulated by oncogenic KRAS in this model is still elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The differential expression of 105 cancer-related microRNAs was examined and compared in HCT116 cells and HKe3 cells (HCT116 cells in which mutated KRAS allele was deleted) in 3D culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HKe3 cells stably overexpressing oncogenic KRAS and the public datasets for microRNA expression analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were further examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increased expression of miR-200c, miR-221 and miR-222 were observed exclusively in 3D culture, but not in the two-dimensional culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These microRNAs were regulated by oncogenic KRAS and were significantly overexpressed in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, the protein expression level of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a putative target of miR-221/222 cluster, was reduced under the control of oncogenic KRAS in a 3D-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oncogenic KRAS regulates 3D-specific molecules, possibly being associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> development in vivo </plain></SENT>
