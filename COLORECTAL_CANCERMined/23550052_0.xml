<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators that inhibit gene expression by promoting <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay and/or suppressing translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relative contributions of these two mechanisms to gene repression remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early studies favor a translational repression-centric scenario, whereas recent large-scale studies suggest a dominant role of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay in miRNA regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we generated proteomics data for nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines and integrated them with matched miRNA and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression data to infer and characterize miRNA-mediated regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous reports, we found that 8mer site, site positioning within 3'UTR, local AU-rich context, and additional 3' pairing could <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> help boost miRNA-mediated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these sequence features were generally not correlated with increased translational repression, except for local AU-rich context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus the contribution of translational repression might be underestimated in recent studies in which the analyses were based primarily on the response of genes with canonical 7-8 mer sites in 3'UTRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we found that translational repression was involved in more than half, and played a major role in one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> predicted miRNA-target interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was even the predominant contributor to miR-138 mediated regulation, which was further supported by the observation that differential expression of miR-138 in two genetically matched cell lines corresponded to altered protein but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance of most target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, our study also provided interesting insights into <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> biology such as the possible contributions of miR-138 and miR-141/miR-200c in inducing specific phenotypes of SW480 and RKO cell lines, respectively </plain></SENT>
