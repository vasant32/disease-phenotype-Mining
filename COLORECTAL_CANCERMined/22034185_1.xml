<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> of colorectal origin appears to be a combination of systemic chemotherapy and complete surgical cytoreduction with synchronous intraperitoneal chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of, and outcomes following, surgical treatment and systemic chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospectively collated data from the Erlangen Registry for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> were analysed for patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> of colorectal origin between 1990 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operative and adjuvant treatment, along with details of postoperative morbidity, were evaluated and correlated with survival outcomes after 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some 125 patients underwent surgical resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds also had non-peritoneal distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>R0/R1 resection was possible in 24 (59 per cent) of 41 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> alone, and in a further seven patients with both peritoneal and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (overall R0/R1 resection rate 24路8 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In-hospital morbidity and mortality rates were 32路0 and 12路0 per cent respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of the 31 patients who underwent R0/R1 resection developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival for the entire group was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following R0/R1 resection median survival was 25 months and the 5-year survival rate 22 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six (4路8 per cent) of the 125 patients survived for more than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Complete resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> was associated with improved survival and was possible in almost 60 per cent of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> alone </plain></SENT>
