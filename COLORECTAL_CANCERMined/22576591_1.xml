<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If SES and social support affects <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment has not been thoroughly explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were initially diagnosed with or who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC, n=781) in three Scandinavian university hospitals from October 2003 to August 2006 was set up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and socioeconomic data were registered prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients living alone more often had synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> at presentation and were less often treated with combination chemotherapy than those cohabitating (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.85, P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical removal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was less common in patients living alone (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.86, P=0.02) but more common among university-educated patients (HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.10-4.49, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Smoking, being married and having children did not influence treatment or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 7.7 months in patients living alone and 11.7 months in patients living with someone (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Living alone remained a prognostic factor for survival after correction for age and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients living alone received less combination chemotherapy and less secondary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Living alone is a strong independent risk factor for poor survival in mCRC </plain></SENT>
