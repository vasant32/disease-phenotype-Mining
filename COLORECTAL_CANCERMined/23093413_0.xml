<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> outcomes in an urban underserved population with sociodemographic factors distinctly different than those previously studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 11-year retrospective study, the demographics and clinical features of 331 CRC patients from a Northern California urban county hospital were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to evaluate differences in 5-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 38 % Whites, 37 % Asians, 22 % Hispanics, and 4 % Blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients either had government-sponsored insurance (62.5 %) or were uninsured (21.8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to national SEER data, stage IV disease was more prevalent in our study cohort (37 vs 20 %) and the overall 5-year survival rate was worse (52.9 vs 64.3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.24, P=0.002), while insurance status was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, advanced age (HR 2.48, confidence interval (CI) 1.39-4.42, P=0.002) and late stage (stage IV: HR 32.46, CI 9.92-106.25, P&lt;0.001) predicted worse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contrary to some population-based studies, Hispanics in our cohort had significantly better overall mortality compared to Whites (HR 0.46, CI 0.29-0.74, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> outcomes for urban underserved populations persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there is geographic and socioeconomic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in factors that have been previously shown to contribute to mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screening and therapeutic strategies formulated from larger population-based studies may not be generalizable to these unique subpopulations </plain></SENT>
