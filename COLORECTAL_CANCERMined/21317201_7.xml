<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sex steroids may play a role in this gender-associated difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to explore the relationship of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in steroid hormone signaling (ESR1, ESR2, PGR, NR1I2, and SHBG), phase I- and II-metabolizing enzyme (COMT, HSD17B1, CYP1A1, CYP17A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and GSTP1), and hormone transporter (ABCB1) genes with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in German women and men, separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the population-based DACHS study (South Germany), 47 putatively functional SNPs were genotyped in 1798 CRC cases (746 women and 1052 men) and 1810 controls (732 women and 1078 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant allele dose-response associations were observed with ESR2_rs1255998, ESR2_rs928554, HSD17B1_rs605059, and ABCB1_rs2229109 in women (P trend=0.004, 0.05, 0.03, and 0.05 respectively) and with ABCB1_rs1045642, ABCB1_rs9282564, and SHBG_rs6259 in men (P trend=0.01, 0.03, and 0.02 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ESR2_rs1255998_G allele showed the most significant association with risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in women, with a per-allele odds ratio (OR) of 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding was replicated in an independent study from North Germany including 1076 female <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and 1151 controls (OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.71-1.04), yielding a per-allele OR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.69-0.93, P trend=0.003) in the pooled sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings implicate a role of ESR2 in the risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in women and suggest that HSD17B1, ABCB1, and SHBG genes may contribute to sex steroid-mediated effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
