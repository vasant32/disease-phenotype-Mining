<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The establishment of KRAS mutation testing in this setting represents a significant change to standard diagnostic procedures and a major advance in the personalization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Against a changing regulatory background, three cross-sectional surveys of physicians in 14 countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia were conducted in 2008, 2009, and 2010 to investigate the uptake and outcome of KRAS testing for patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physicians in each year answered questions on four patients (last patient seen and last seen in first-, second- and third-line settings) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fieldwork was carried out February-May 2008, January-April 2009, and January-April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from 3,819, 3,740 and 3,820 anonymized, uncoded patient records were collated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of KRAS testing in patients with mCRC increased from 3% in 2008 to 47% in 2009 and 69% in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2010 survey revealed that test results were available within 15Â days for 82%, 51% and 98% of the 1679, 679, and 261 tested patients in the European, Latin American and Asian regions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab was the most commonly administered targeted agent in tested patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mCRC (798/1607 patients; 50%) and bevacizumab was the most commonly administered targeted agent in tested patients with KRAS mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (396/893; 44% overall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, KRAS testing is now widely established as a routine diagnostic procedure for patients with mCRC and is used increasingly to guide treatment selection </plain></SENT>
