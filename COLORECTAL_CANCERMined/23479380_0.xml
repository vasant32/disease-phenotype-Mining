<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We sought to identify predictors of self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surveillance participation among 5-year survivors who completed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood Cancer</z:e> Survivor Study (CCSS) 2007 Follow-Up Questionnaire and met the criteria above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariable generalized linear models with a log link and Poisson distribution were used to calculate relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surveillance guidelines (i.e., home stool blood testing and/or colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of 711 childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors eligible for the study was 44 years (SD = 5.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 231 (32.5%) reported ever performing home stool blood testing and 276 (38.8%) reported ever having colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 711 participants, 60 (8.4%) reported home stool blood testing in the past year (meeting screening guidelines for the general adult population) and 207 (29.1%) reported having a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years (meeting surveillance recommendations for survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> treated with radiation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariable analyses, factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surveillance were age 50 years or older (RR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.9-2.9); having routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> follow-up visit within one year prior to questionnaire completion (RR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.5); having a physical impairment requiring the assistance of others for routine activities of daily living (RR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.2); and having discussed future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk with a physician at their most recent follow-up visit (RR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: More than 70% of survivors at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were not screened as recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, unless a physician discussed their future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, most survivors were not screened until they reached age 50, the time at which <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is recommended for individuals at average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings underscore the need for education of survivors and their physicians regarding the heightened <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk following radiation </plain></SENT>
