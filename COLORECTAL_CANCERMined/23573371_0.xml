<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated patients (n=652) who had undergone <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery (colectomy, colectomy of the rectum and sigmoid colon, total colectomy, total proctectomy) at five teaching hospitals during 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality was defined as 30-day or in-hospital surgical mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk-adjusted mortality models were constructed using claims data (basic model) with the addition of TNM staging (TNM model), physiological data (physiological model), surgical data (surgical model), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical data (composite model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to develop the risk-adjustment models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To compare the performance of the models, both c-statistics using Hanley-McNeil pair-wise testing and the ratio of the observed to the expected mortality within quartiles of mortality risk were evaluated to assess the abilities of discrimination and calibration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The physiological model (c=0.92), surgical model (c=0.92), and composite model (c=0.93) displayed a similar improvement in discrimination, whereas the TNM model (c=0.87) displayed little improvement over the basic model (c=0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discriminatory power of the models did not differ by the Hanley-McNeil test (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within each quartile of mortality, the composite and surgical models displayed an expected mortality ratio close to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of clinical data to claims data efficiently enhances the performance of the risk-adjusted postoperative mortality models in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommended that the performance of models should be evaluated through both discrimination and calibration </plain></SENT>
