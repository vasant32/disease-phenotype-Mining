<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to assess the clinical outcomes of a transanal tube (Dennis colorectal tube [DCT]) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with ACO, focusing in particular on the impact of the DCT on subsequent elective LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients and methods: Among 1142 patients who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between January 2007 and December 2011, 92 patients with ACO were identified retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 92 patients, the DCT procedure was performed in 66 patients who fulfilled the indications for DCT, and these patients were included in the study.Results: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 66 patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Technical and clinical success rates for DCT were 93.9 % and 86.4 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> after DCT occurred in 4.5 % and the mortality rate was 1.5 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of LAC was 48.5 %, and the rate of primary stoma was 13.6 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For curative stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with ACO, DCT resulted in a primary stoma rate of 13.6 %, a one-stage surgery rate of 90.9 %, a LAC rate of 50.0 %, and a 3-year survival rate of 73.1 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases with clinical success by DCT, the one-stage surgery rate was 97.4 % and the LAC rate was 56.4 %.Conclusions: DCT achieved a high rate of clinical success and enabled safe one-stage surgery and LAC for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with ACO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DCT followed by LAC is proposed as a promising non-invasive strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with ACO </plain></SENT>
