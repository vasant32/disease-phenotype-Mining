<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Pain is prevalent among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, yet pain management patterns in outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 3,123 ambulatory patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> of the breast, prostate, colon/rectum, or lung were enrolled onto this prospective study regardless of phase of care or stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At initial assessment and 4 to 5 weeks later, patients completed a 25-item measure of pain, functional interference, and other symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Providers recorded <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> prescribing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pain management index was calculated to assess treatment adequacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 3,023 patients we identified to be at risk for pain, 2,026 (67%) reported having pain or requiring <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> at initial assessment; of these 2,026 patients, 670 (33%) were receiving inadequate <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> prescribing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in treatment adequacy between the initial and follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis revealed that the odds of a non-Hispanic white patient having inadequate pain treatment were approximately half those of a minority patient after adjusting for other explanatory variables (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.70; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other significant predictors of inadequate pain treatment were having a good performance status, being treated at a minority treatment site, and having nonadvanced disease without concurrent treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most outpatients with common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> must confront issues related to pain and the use of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is significant disparity in pain treatment adequacy, with the odds of undertreatment twice as high for minority patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings persist over 1 month of follow-up, highlighting the complexity of these problems </plain></SENT>
