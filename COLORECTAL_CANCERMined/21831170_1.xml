<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This national study consisted of 3571 patients for whom information on DRM was available and who were radically treated by anterior resection between 1993 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 3342 (93.5%) patients had not received preoperative radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DRM was measured on fixed specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year local recurrence rate was 14.5% for patients with a DRM of 0-10 mm compared to 9.6% for patients with a DRM of 11-20 mm, 8.9% for a DRM of 21-30 mm, 7.0% for a DRM of 31-40 mm, 7.7% for a DRM of 41-50 mm and 8.7% for a DRM of &gt; 50 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for other independent prognostic factors, a DRM of 0-10 mm was found to have significant impact on local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DRM had no impact on distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients treated without radiotherapy, a DRM of &gt; 10 mm is recommended </plain></SENT>
