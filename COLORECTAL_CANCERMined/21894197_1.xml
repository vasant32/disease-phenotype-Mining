<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological evidence has shown a small, but significant association between fruit and vegetable intake and a reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro and animal data have also demonstrated that many dietary phytochemicals have potent chemopreventive activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in humans, single-agent compounds have yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A key concept is that dietary phytochemicals exert beneficial effects at low concentrations when working in synergy with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the gut microflora evolved in an environment rich in dietary fiber and phytochemicals, the rapid shift towards a Western diet creates an environment in which the gut is more vulnerable to carcinogens, genetic alterations and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As enforcing dietary interventions on large populations is not realistic, we believe future chemopreventive work should focus on delivering phytochemical mixtures that target the multiple molecular events involved in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
