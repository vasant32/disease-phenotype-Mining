<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development among patients with IBD enrolled in the observational cohort <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> et Surrisque Associ√© aux Maladies Inflammatoires Intestinales En France (CESAME) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: We followed and collected data from 19,486 patients with IBD (60.3% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 30.1% receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy) enrolled in CESAME from May 2004 and June 2005, and followed until December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the study began, 2841 patients (14.6%) were characterized as having long-standing, extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (&gt;10 years, involving 50% or more of the colon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early lesions (HGD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were defined as those diagnosed within 10 years after diagnosis of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Thirty-seven patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during the follow-up period, and 20 developed colorectal HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The standardized incidence ratios of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 2.2 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IBD patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-3.0; P &lt;.0001), 7.0 for patients with long-standing extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (95% CI, 4.4-10.5; P &lt;.001), and 1.1 for patients without long-standing extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (95% CI, 0.6-1.8; P =.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with long-standing extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, the multivariate adjusted hazard ratio for colorectal HGD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 0.28 for those who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, compared to those who never received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy (95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients developed early lesions; 7 of these were related to IBD, based on histologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: Patients with IBD and long-standing extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> are at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, although risk is lower among patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients without long-standing extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> have a risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> similar to that of the general population, but they can develop IBD-related lesions within 10 years after diagnosis of IBD </plain></SENT>
