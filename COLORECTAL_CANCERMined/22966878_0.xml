<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several dietary and lifestyle factors can modulate DNA methylation suggesting that they may influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk through epigenetic regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Wnt regulatory genes DKK1 and Wnt5a are important contributors to colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and are often silenced by promoter hypermethylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; however, the dietary contributions to these events have not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the link between dietary/lifestyle factors and epigenetic regulation of these Wnt signaling genes, we assessed promoter methylation of these genes in a large cohort of Canadian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from Ontario (n = 549) and Newfoundland (n = 443) and examined associations to dietary/lifestyle factors implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk and/or DNA methylation including intake of vitamins, fats, cholesterol, fiber, and alcohol as well as body mass index (BMI), and smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several factors were associated with methylation status including alcohol intake, BMI, and cigarette smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most significantly, however, dietary <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake was strongly negatively associated with DKK1 methylation in Newfoundland (P = 0.001) and a similar trend was observed in Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> and other dietary/lifestyle factors may alter <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk by mediating extracellular Wnt inhibition </plain></SENT>
