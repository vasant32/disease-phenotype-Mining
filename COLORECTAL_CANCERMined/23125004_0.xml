<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This raises potential challenges in how and when to target services; however, data describing longitudinal patterns of distress are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study describes the long term psychological outcomes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) survivors and trajectories of adjustment over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective survey of a population-based sample of 1966 CRC survivors assessed sociodemographic variables, perceived social support and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e>, including distress subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149779" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">somatization</z:e>, at six time points from 5 months to 5 years post-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the 5-year trajectory, the prevalence of high overall distress ranged between 44% and 32% but was greater for men compared with women (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four distress trajectory styles within clusters were identified for overall distress and for each distress subtype with a constant low distress group providing the basis for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher distress trajectories varied for overall distress and distress subtypes but were generally differentiated by gender, younger age, lower education, poor socioeconomic advantage, late disease stage and poor social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For global distress, by comparison with women, men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are vulnerable to distress, with men who are younger and with low education and poor social support being a priority for targeted intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While distress screening early in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> experience will identify those with a constant high distress trajectory, others with late emerging distress or caseness may be missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On this basis, distress screening through the illness trajectory into long term survivorship seems warranted </plain></SENT>
