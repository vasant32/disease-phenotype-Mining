<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Immunochemical faecal occult blood tests perform as well with either one or two samples, and better than guaiac tests with 6 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Clarifying relationship between tests' performance, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> pattern and observation level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data of 32,225 average-risk subjects who performed both Hemoccult II (guaiac) and Magstream (immunochemical) tests were re-analysed by varying the cutoff and number of samples of Magstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The identical performances obtained using one or two samples of Magstream (lower cutoff for one sample) at the population level were explained by opposite patterns of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> according to the presence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They translated into discrepancy at the individual level: for example a 60% increase in sensitivity and 20% in specificity observed with one (39ng Hb/ml cutoff) or two samples (63ng Hb/ml cutoff) Magstream compared with Hemoccult II meant that 28.5% of the subjects testing positive with one sample (18.0% in subjects with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>) would have been considered negative by using two samples of Magstream at a higher cutoff (and reciprocal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The identical performance of immunochemical tests using one or two samples (different cutoff), explained by opposite pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> according to advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> is true only at the population level, the appropriate level for mass screening </plain></SENT>
