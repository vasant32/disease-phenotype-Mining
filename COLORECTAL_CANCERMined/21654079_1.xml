<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intestine is extremely sensitive to surgical stress with consequent postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the increase of reactive oxygen species as subcellular changes plays an important role in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article focuses on the effect of surgical stress on nuclear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA from healthy sections of colon and rectum of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA copy number, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> common deletion and nuclear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine content were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the colon and rectal tissue were significantly damaged either at the nuclear or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA was more damaged in rectum than in colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present investigation found an association between surgical stress and nuclear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA damage, suggesting that surgery may generate an increase in free radicals, which trigger a cascade of molecular changes, including alterations in DNA </plain></SENT>
