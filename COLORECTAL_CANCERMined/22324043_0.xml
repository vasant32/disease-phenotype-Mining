<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells (RSC, RRC1, and RRC2) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition percentage (%inhibition) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and relative quantitation of thymidylate synthase (TS) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were measured on day 2, day 5 after replacement of 70% media on day 2, day 7, and day 3 after replacement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> media on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doses that produced 50% inhibition (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Dm</z:e>) were calculated to evaluate drug effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative quantitation of TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and correlations between TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and 5-FU concentrations were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RRC1 was more resistant than RRC2 on day 7, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Dm</z:e> value of RRC2 increased three days after replacement of media from 12.3 to 18.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of RSC on D2 and D7 were significantly lower than those of RRC1 and RRC2, respectively (P = 0.004, P = 0.004 on D2; P = 0.010, P = 0.006 on D7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in RRC1 were significantly reversely correlated with 5-FU concentrations on day 2 (correlation coefficient = -0.867, P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, correlations were not significant in RRC2 (r = 0.067) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Evaluating %inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells at one point in chemosensitivity tests seems to be inadequate in determining chemotherapeutic regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multilateral approaches, such as trials evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell survival before and after media replacement and correlations between TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and 5-FU concentrations, needs to be implemented for the practical application of chemosensitivity tests </plain></SENT>
