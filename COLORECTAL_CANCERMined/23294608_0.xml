<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The objective of this first-in-human trial included the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and antitumour effects of KRN330, a novel fully-human monoclonal antibody directed against A33, a membrane bound <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> uniformly expressed in 95% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) refractory to standard therapy were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients received weekly intravenous KRN330 (0.1-10mg/kg) for a minimum of 4 weeks in a standard 3+3 design, and nine patients received q2week doses at 3mg/kg with pre- and post-biopsies to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> binding and safety on this schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common KRN330 related adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (66%), diarrhoea (61%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MTD was 3mg/kg weekly, with dose-limiting grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicities at 10mg/kg and the intermediate dose level of 6mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics of KRN330 was linear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stable disease was reported in 12/38 patients (32%), with a median duration of 155 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of human anti-human antibodies, and immunohistochemistry on biopsy samples demonstrated that KRN330 remained bound to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> 2 weeks after dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KRN330 is safe and tolerable at the MTD of 3mg/kg once weekly in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dosing on alternate weeks is supported by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The long treatment durations and lack of immunogenicity warrant further investigation of KRN330 in combination </plain></SENT>
