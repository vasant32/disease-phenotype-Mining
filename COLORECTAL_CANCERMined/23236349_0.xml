<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on a disease are increasingly available from multiple related populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, meta-analyses can improve power to detect homogeneous genetic associations, but if there exist ancestry-specific effects, via interactions on genetic background or with a causal effect that co-varies with genetic background, then these will typically be obscured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we have developed a robust statistical method for detecting susceptibility gene-ancestry interactions in multi-cohort GWAS based on closely-related populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We use the leading principal components of the empirical genotype matrix to cluster individuals into "ancestry groups" and then look for evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> genetic associations with disease or other trait across these clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Robustness is improved when there are multiple cohorts, as the signal from true gene-ancestry interactions can then be distinguished from gene-collection artefacts by comparing the observed interaction effect sizes in collection groups relative to ancestry groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When applied to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we identified a missense polymorphism in iron-absorption gene CYBRD1 that associated with disease in individuals of English, but not Scottish, ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association replicated in two additional, independently-collected data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our method can be used to detect associations between genetic variants and disease that have been obscured by population <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can be readily extended to the identification of genetic interactions on other covariates such as measured environmental exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We envisage our methodology being of particular interest to researchers with existing GWAS data, as ancestry groups can be easily defined and thus tested for interactions </plain></SENT>
