<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of introducing into the UK's NHS a national screening programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> based on faecal occult blood testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Demonstration pilot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two English health authorities and three Scottish health boards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: People aged 50-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 478,250 residents of the pilot areas were invited to take part in the screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uptake (the proportion in whom a final faecal occult blood test result was available) was 56.8% (n = 271,646) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of a positive test result was 1.9% and the rate for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 1.62 per 1000 people screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both these values were higher in Scotland than in England, higher in men than in women, and increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was 10.9% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and 35.0% for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>552 cancers were detected by screening; 92 (16.6%) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>48% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screen detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were Dukes's stage A, and 1% had metastasised at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by testing for faecal occult blood is feasible within the context of the United Kingdom's NHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screening should lead to a reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the population offered screening </plain></SENT>
