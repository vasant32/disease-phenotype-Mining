<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A metastasectomy of the lung is reported to improve the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience in evaluating the surgical outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who have undergone a pulmonary metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-center retrospective evaluation of clinical prognostic factors (1996-2008) related to a pulmonary metastasectomy of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven consecutive patients in our hospital who had undergone a resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were retrospectively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients who underwent an initial pulmonary metastasectomy was 63.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> was 3.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary metastasectomy was performed an average of 1.6 times per head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 patients had undergone a liver metastasectomy, and the 5-year survival of these 32 patients was 43.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival of the time from first pulmonary metastasectomy was 53.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences with regard to the disease-free interval, interval from primary resection, or the number of pulmonary metastasectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A pulmonary resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> is therefore considered to be a favorable treatment for long-term survival even in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thoracic surgeons should therefore aggressively perform a pulmonary metastasectomy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
