<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetic profile of a chronomodulated, dose-intensified regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (N = 18) with 0 or 1 line of prior chemotherapy received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 100 mg/m(2) on day 1 from 1400 to 1800 hours with escalating dose levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (2,500, 3,000, 3,500, 4,000, 4,500, and 5,000 mg) once daily taken at 2400 hours on days 1-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each cycle lasted 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MTD of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> was 4,500 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transaminitis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were the commonest non-hematologic and hematologic toxicities, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicities were generally mild, with only five occurrences of grade 3 toxicity and none of grade 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no dose-limiting toxicities, defined as specific grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurring in the first two cycles of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The objective response rate was 33.3 %, and median overall survival was 16.3 months (95 % CI: 11.2-18.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC([0-âˆž])) of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> metabolites in our fixed-dosing chronomodulated regimen were comparable to values seen with comparably dose-intense regimens but associated with significantly reduced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chronomodulated dose-intensified XELOX facilitates delivery of dose-intense treatment in mCRC with a favorable therapeutic index that is promising </plain></SENT>
