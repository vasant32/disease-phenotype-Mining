<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the prevalence of endoscopic lesions, according to age and location, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> who underwent total colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospective observational study examining records from the hepatogastroenterology department at the Cocody University Hospital (Abidjan) of colonoscopies for rectal examination from September 1, 1991, through August 15, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data collected and analyzed from the records included age, sex and colonoscopy results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 1,158 colonoscopies, 270 (23.3%) were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo>: 105 women (mean age: 48.8 years ± 19.9 years, range: 10-96 years) and 165 men (mean age: 46 ± 14.2, range: 21-83 years) with a sex-ratio (M/F) of 1.57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> seems to occur at a younger age in Africa, patients were divided into two groups (aged 45 years: 139 [51.5%] and above 45 years: 131 [48.5%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities found were consistent with anal pathologies (16.3%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (10.4%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> (11.1%), colorectal inflammatory lesions (21.5%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diverticula were significantly more common in those older than 45 years and inflammatory lesions in the younger group (p &lt; 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More than two thirds of the significant lesions were found in the distal colon (p &lt; 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The predominance of distal colon lesions suggests that exploration by flexible sigmoidoscopy can be performed in patients with low to moderate risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with total colonoscopy reserved for the population at high risk </plain></SENT>
