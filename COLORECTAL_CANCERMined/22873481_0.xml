<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We evaluated changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) incidence and mortality by anatomic site to assess the possible impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using data from 9 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries, we estimated trends in 1975-2007 CRC incidence and 1985-2007 incidence-based mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated trends separately for proximal and distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, overall and by stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, and race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1975 and 2007, 323 237 adults in the study area were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and population subgroups, incidence rates increased between 1975 and 1985 and subsequently declined markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Declines were most rapid between 1999 and 2007 and were greater for distal than proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Declines in incidence were greater for White than Black adults and greatest for regional-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was little difference in trends across subsites within the proximal and distal colorectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Declines in incidence-based mortality mirrored those for incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recent declines in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality are greater for distal than proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differing trends across populations may reflect variations in screening prevalence; distinct trends by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics likely reflect differences in screening efficacy </plain></SENT>
