<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In resectable cases, surgery is the only potentially curative treatment and achieves survival rates up to 50% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Management is complex, as colorectal resection, liver resection, chemotherapy, and, in locally advanced mid/low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e>, radiotherapy have to be integrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Modern medical practice usually relies on evidence-based protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of evidence for synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> are poor: published studies include few recent prospective series and several retrospective analyses collecting a limited number of patients across long periods of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data are difficult to be generalized and are mainly representative of single centre's experience, biased by local recruitment, indications and surgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this context, surgeons have to renounce to "evidence-based medicine" and to adopt a sort of "experience-based medicine" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anyway, some suggestions are possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous colorectal and liver resection can be safely performed whenever minor hepatectomies are planned, while a case-by-case evaluation is mandatory in case of more complex procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is preferentially scheduled for patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> to assess disease biology and to control lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can be safely performed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> in situ, even planning simultaneous resection at its end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Locally advanced mid/low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumor</z:e> represents a further indication to neoadjuvant therapies, even if treatment's schedule is not yet standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, several issues have to be solved, but every single HPB centre should define its proper strategy to optimize patient's selection, disease control and safety and completeness of surgery </plain></SENT>
