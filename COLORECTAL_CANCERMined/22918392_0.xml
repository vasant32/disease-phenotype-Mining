<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A pre-colonoscopy consultation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening is necessary to assess a screenee's general health status and to explain benefits and risks of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first option allows for personal attention, whereas a telephone consultation does not require travelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that a telephone consultation would lead to higher response and participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening compared with a face-to-face consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 6600 persons (50-75 years) were 1:1 randomised for primary colonoscopy screening with a pre-colonoscopy consultation either face-to-face or by telephone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both arms, we counted the number of invitees who attended a pre-colonoscopy consultation (response) and the number of those who subsequently attended colonoscopy (participation), relative to the number invited for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire regarding satisfaction with the consultation and expected burden of the colonoscopy (scored on five-point rating scales) was sent to invitees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides, a questionnaire to assess the perceived burden of colonoscopy was sent to participants, 14 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 3302 invitees were allocated to the telephone group and 3298 to the face-to-face group, of which 794 (24%) attended a telephone consultation and 822 (25%) a face-to-face consultation (P=0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 674 (20%) participants in the telephone group and 752 (23%) in the face-to-face group attended colonoscopy (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Invitees and responders in the telephone group expected the bowel preparation to be more painful than those in the face-to-face group while perceived burden scores for the full screening procedure were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More subjects in the face-to-face group than in the telephone group were satisfied by the consultation in general: (99.8% vs 98.5%, P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using a telephone rather than a face-to-face consultation in a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> colonoscopy screening programme leads to similar response rates but significantly lower colonoscopy participation </plain></SENT>
