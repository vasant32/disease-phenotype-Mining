<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Van-Gogh-like 2 (VANGL2) belongs to the non-canonical WNT pathway whose activation inhibits canonical WNT signaling </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proliferation, colony formation and activation of the WNT pathway were tested in cells after VANGL2 overexpression.Results:Van-Gogh-like 2 mRNA was significantly higher in 5-aza-treated RKO, LOVO and SW48, whereas no differences were found in SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Van-Gogh-like 2 was fully methylated in RKO, SW48, HCT116, DLD1 and Caco2; partially methylated in LOVO, LS174T and SW837; and unmethylated in SW480, SW620 and HT29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher expression of VANGL2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was found in the unmethylated cell lines </plain></SENT>
