<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms of the gene encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) have been studied widely in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, reports on the association of various polymorphisms with certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> are contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have investigated whether the prevalence of the most common polymorphism (C677T) in the MTHFR gene has any link with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, using genomic DNA and polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the heterozygous variant (677CT) but not that of 677TT was found to be significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases than in controls (p &lt; 0.039; odds ratio 2.35 and 95% confidence interval 1.02-5.415) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies for 677CT were 11.0 and 5.0% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples and controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, the frequency of the 677TT variant was 6.0% which differed significantly (p &lt; 0.026) from the control value of 1.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the frequencies of the variants in cervical, thyroid, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cases did not differ from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data taken together with other reports indicates that the polymorphism C677T of MTHFR is a risk factor for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> but not cervical, thyroid, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study also reconfirms that frequencies of the variants are not gender-specific </plain></SENT>
