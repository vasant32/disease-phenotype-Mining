<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PRL-3-associated proteins were analysed using functional distribution and category enrichment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to detect nuclear PRL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between PRL-3 and JMJD1B or JMJD2B and the roles of JMJD1B, JMJD2B and PRL-3 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> demethylation were determined after these proteins were knocked down using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case-control studies on JMJD1B and JMJD2B in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were performed using immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The in vitro functional effects of JMJD2B and JMJD1B were examined further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: JMJD1B and JMJD2B, two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> demethylases, were enriched among PRL-3-associated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nuclear PRL-3 was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and clinical samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of nuclear PRL-3 was increased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at more advanced Dukes' stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PRL-3 was involved in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methylation by affecting the activities of JMJD1B and JMJD2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A low expression of the JMJD1B protein was positively correlated with the lymph node status (p=0.032), Dukes' classification (p=0.008) and TNM staging (p=0.022) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high expression of JMJD2B was positively correlated with the lymph node status (p=0.03), Dukes' classification (p=0.036) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion (p=0.003) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A loss-of-function analysis confirmed that JMJD2B promoted the proliferation, colony formation and migration of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data reveal a new role for PRL-3 as a key regulator of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> demethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>JMJD1B seems to be a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor and JMJD2B seems to be a potential oncoprotein in the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
