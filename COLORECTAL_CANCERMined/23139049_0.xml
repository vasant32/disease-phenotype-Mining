<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study defined the resectability regardless of the size and number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, and attempted curative hepatic resection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four patients that tolerated chemotherapy were diagnosed with CLM (colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>) without extrahepatic metastase from January 2007 to November 2010, and received an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the resectability after chemotherapy, and the patients were divided in two groups; the resected and unresected group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients underwent hepatic resection without chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five patients underwent surgical resection (resected group) and twenty-nine patients were considered unresectable (unresected group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 35 patients in the resected group safely received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy safely without serious adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No serious postoperative complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (MST) was significantly higher in the resected than in the unresected group (56.93 [95 % CI 38.13-75.73] and 25.07 months [95 % CI 17.87-32.26], respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median disease-free survival was 20.2 [95 % CI 8.82-31.65] months in the resected group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preoperative chemotherapy for CLM is well tolerated and does not increase postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Curative surgery with preoperative chemotherapy has the potential to improve the overall survival in patients with CLM </plain></SENT>
