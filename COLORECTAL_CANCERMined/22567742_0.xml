<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It could maintain significant plasma concentration of 5, 10-meTHF during the whole 5-FU perfusion with the potential of increasing 5-FU cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized phase II clinical trial on leucovorin calcium (LV/Ca) and LV/Na in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main objectives were to assess efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty seven patients with mCRC and no previous chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were randomized to receive LV/Na or LV/Ca with irinotecan or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatine</z:chebi> combined with infusional 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV/Na was defined as warranting further evaluation in phase III if true overall response rate (ORR) &gt; 35% (α=5%, β=10% in case of true ORR &gt;55%, 51 evaluable patients planned/arm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results for LV/Ca and LV/Na arm respectively were: observed ORR, 55% (significantly higher than 35%, p = 0.02) and 61% (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival durations were 11.9 months and 22.9 months (p = 0.02) and PFS 8.0 vs. 11.5 months (ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 events were 64% and 46% (p = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both LV/Na and LV/Ca disclosed an ORR &gt; 35% with comparable safety </plain></SENT>
