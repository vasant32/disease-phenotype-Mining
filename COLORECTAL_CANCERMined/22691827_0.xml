<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Changes in working practices implemented over the last decade particularly with respect to subspecialisation have changed the working practices of the traditional general surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of non-colorectal specialists who wish to continue abdominal surgery have been limited to pursue right sided colorectal pathology only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of colorectal procedures performed by one non-colorectal specialist general surgeon who commenced consultant practice in 1991 and compare these outcomes against the outcomes recorded in the literature for low and high volume caseload surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient records of 131 patients who underwent right hemicolectomy by a single surgeon between March 1991 and December 2010 were retrieved and retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent midline laparotomy with two-layer handsewn end-end or end-side ileocolonic anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications of interest were postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and clinically relevant anastomotic leaks as well as clinically diagnosed medical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 61.5 years (range 17-83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 92 patients were operated upon for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and 39 patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No anastomotic leaks occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was only a single inpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our small study of a single surgeon's career long practice for elective right hemicolectomies demonstrates that high standards in terms of anastomotic leak rates and operative mortality can be achieved in clinical practice by the non-specialist General Surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, prospective data collection would be required to apply this to the broader non-colorectal specialist community </plain></SENT>
