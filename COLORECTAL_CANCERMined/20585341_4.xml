<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated associations between polymorphisms in both miRNA-containing genomic regions (primary and precursor miRNA) and in genes related to miRNA biogenesis with clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and irinotecan (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in 61 patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genotypes CC and CT were favorable when compared with the TT variant genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, SNP rs1834306, located in the pri-miR-100 gene, significantly correlated with a longer <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the miRNA-biogenesis pathway, a trend was identified between SNP rs11077 in the exportin-5 gene and disease control rate (P=0.076) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to suggest a relationship between treatment outcome and SNPs in the miRNA-biogenesis machinery, in both primary and precursor miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that miRNA polymorphic variants might be useful predictors of clinical outcome in mCRC patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 combination </plain></SENT>
