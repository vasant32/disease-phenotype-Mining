<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> studies showed the unique characteristics of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCCs</z:chebi> were more prevalent in women than men and old patients, and the age difference between <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e> was more apparent in women </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the left and right colon have been considered as dichotomous or even different organs in the view of molecular, histopathological, epidemiologic and clinical bases for over three decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the evolutionary data suggesting linearity from the rectum to ascending colon beyond the simple right-left dichotomization in the views of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> molecular features and site-specific clinicopathological differences, support the need for a paradigm shift to the colorectal continuum model rather than the traditional two-colon concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This new multi-segmental or colorectal continuum hypothesis would provide both the better understanding of the complex etiology of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and the tailored preventive and therapeutic strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> including individualized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programs </plain></SENT>
