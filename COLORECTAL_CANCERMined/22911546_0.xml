<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is much controversy not only regarding the most appropriate therapeutic approach in the neoadjuvant setting but also after surgery is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many patients will experience early relapses but others will be long survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We need to establish reliable prognostic and predictive factors to offer a tailored treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several prognostic factors after metastasectomy have been identified: high C-reactive protein levels, a high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, elevated neutrophil count and low serum albumin are related to a worst outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated CEA and Ki 67 levels, intrahepatic and perihepatic lymph node invasion are also some of the markers related to a worst outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the administration of preoperative chemotherapy has been associated with a better prognosis after hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The administration of adjuvant chemotherapy should be done taking in consideration these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding predictive factors, determination of ERCC1, TS, TP and DPD and UGT1 polymorphisms assessment could be considered prior to chemotherapy administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This would avoid treatment related toxicities and increase this population quality of life </plain></SENT>
