<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we have identified two genomic regions in which pairs of tagging-single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) are associated with disease; these comprise chromosomes 1q41 (rs6691170, rs6687758) and 12q13.13 (rs7163702, rs11169552) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated these regions further, aiming to determine whether they contain more than one independent association signal and/or to identify the SNPs most strongly associated with disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of additional sample sets at the original tagSNPs showed that, for both regions, the two tagSNPs were unlikely to identify a single haplotype on which the functional variation lay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, one of the pair of SNPs did not fully capture the association signal in each region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore undertook more detailed analyses, using imputation, logistic regression, genealogical analysis using the GENECLUSTER program and haplotype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 1q41 region, the SNP rs11118883 emerged as a strong candidate based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these analyses, sufficient to account for the signals at both rs6691170 and rs6687758 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rs11118883 lies within a region with strong evidence of transcriptional regulatory activity and has been associated with expression of PDGFRB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For 12q13.13, a complex situation was found: SNP rs7972465 showed stronger association than either rs11169552 or rs7136702, and GENECLUSTER found no good evidence for a two-SNP model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, logistic regression and haplotype analyses supported a two-SNP model, in which a signal at the SNP rs706793 was added to that at rs11169552 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post-GWAS fine-mapping studies are challenging, but the use of multiple tools can assist in identifying candidate functional variants in at least some cases </plain></SENT>
