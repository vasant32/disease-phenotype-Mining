<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its prognostic significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has not been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to confirm the expression of S100P in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as well as the epigenetic mechanism underlying its gene expression, and to demonstrate whether S100P could be used to predict prognosis as a biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the expression of S100P in 96 CRCs and their paired tissue controls, as well as 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines by RT-PCR and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of the S100P protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly higher in cancerous regions compared to that in paired non-cancerous tissues (P=4.59 x 10(-17), 0.005 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression was significantly correlated with the hypomethylation of the S100P promoter (P=4.92 x 10(-5)), which was detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> sequencing PCR (BSP) and quantitative methylation-specific real-time PCR (QMSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In stages I to III, the patients with positive expression of S100P protein showed poorer overall survival compared to those with S100P negative expression, P=0.031 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also measured the preoperative serum S100P levels by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum levels of S100P showed favorable prognosis compared with patients with elevated S100P levels (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that S100P protein may be a potential novel prognostic biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
