<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> chemotherapy reduces recurrences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but causes severe gastrointestinal toxicity, partly related to disturbed intestinal microbiota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY: Resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (n=143) were analyzed for colonic methanogenesis and pH before and during the 24 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> chemotherapy and for gastrointestinal symptoms during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was performed within the setting of an intervention study on the effects of Lactobacillus on chemotherapy-related gastrointestinal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The site of resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, resection type, stoma, chemotherapy regimen, hypolactasia, and Lactobacillus intervention were considered as possible confounding factors, and multivariate models were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> producers had less frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (more than or equal to moderate) during chemotherapy than nonproducers [odds ratio (OR), 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20 to 0.88; P=0.022] and more frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 2.01 to 10.32; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline fecal pH was also associated with symptoms during chemotherapy; higher the pH, the lower the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.02; P=0.058) and higher the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.35 to 3.68; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate stepwise models, methanogenesis was a significant explaining factor with inverse association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and positive association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fecal pH, which was significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> production, was no longer a significant explaining factor when methanogensis was included in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">Methane</z:chebi> producer status has a role in determining whether patient experiences <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This underscores the importance of intestinal microbiota in the development of intestinal toxicity during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
