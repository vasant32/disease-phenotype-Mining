<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal-cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1993 through 2001, we randomly assigned 154,900 men and women 55 to 74 years of age either to screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy, with a repeat screening at 3 or 5 years, or to usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from the disease were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 77,445 participants randomly assigned to screening (intervention group), 83.5% underwent baseline flexible sigmoidoscopy and 54.0% were screened at 3 or 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after a median follow-up of 11.9 years was 11.9 cases per 10,000 person-years in the intervention group (1012 cases), as compared with 15.2 cases per 10,000 person-years in the usual-care group (1287 cases), which represents a 21% reduction (relative risk, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.85; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions were observed in the incidence of both distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (479 cases in the intervention group vs. 669 cases in the usual-care group; relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001) and proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (512 cases vs. 595 cases; relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.97; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 2.9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> per 10,000 person-years in the intervention group (252 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>), as compared with 3.9 per 10,000 person-years in the usual-care group (341 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>), which represents a 26% reduction (relative risk, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.87; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality from distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was reduced by 50% (87 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the intervention group vs. 175 in the usual-care group; relative risk, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P&lt;0.001); mortality from proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was unaffected (143 and 147 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, respectively; relative risk, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.22; P=0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy was associated with a significant decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal-cancer</z:e> incidence (in both the distal and proximal colon) and mortality (distal colon only) </plain></SENT>
