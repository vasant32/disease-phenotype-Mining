<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab has shown consistent clinical efficacy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC), but some patients respond better than others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is crucial to identify biomarkers that permit the recognition of potentially responsive subjects and to spare toxicity in those who are unlikely benefit from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 24 mCRC patients undergoing Bevacizumab-based first-line treatment, we assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry changes in circulating endothelial cell (CEC) number, their apoptotic fraction (<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-CEC) and their mutual relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were compared with those from a group of 21 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CECs and <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-CECs were higher in patients versus controls (p = 0.01 and p &gt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in CECs at the 3rd cycle in complete response (CR) patients was statistically significant (p = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A better progression-free survival was evidenced in patients that showed an increase in CECs at the 6th cycle (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding the changes in CECs and <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-CECs, a strong correlation was evidenced, at baseline, both in the global population (0.002; r: 0.53) and in the CR subgroup (p: 0.02; r: 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the partial response + stable and progression disease (SD + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) subgroup, this correlation was highly significant at the 6th cycle (p: 0.001; r: 0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the predictive role of an increase in CECs in mCRC patients treated with Bevacizumab-based therapy and showed that modifications in CECs and <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-CECs are independent factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This underlines the relevance of a simultaneous quantitative and functional evaluation of these biomarkers in view of their possible diagnostic utility </plain></SENT>
