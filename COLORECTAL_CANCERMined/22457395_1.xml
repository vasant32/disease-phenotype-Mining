<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, rats were fed Western-type diets moderate in fat (19%) and protein (20%) containing digestible starches [low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28102">amylose</z:chebi> maize <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> (LAMS) or low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28102">amylose</z:chebi> whole wheat (LAW)] or RS [HAMS, HAMSB, or a whole high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28102">amylose</z:chebi> wheat (HAW) generated by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference] for 11 wk (n = 10/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A control diet included 7% fat, 13% protein, and LAMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonocyte DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) were significantly higher (by 70%) in rats fed the Western diet containing LAMS relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary HAW, HAMS, and HAMSB opposed this effect while raising digesta levels of SCFA and lowering ammonia and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SSB correlated inversely with total large bowel SCFA, including colonic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> concentration (R(2) = 0.40; P = 0.009), and positively with colonic ammonia concentration (R(2) = 0.40; P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of gut microbiota populations using a phylogenetic microarray revealed profiles that fell into 3 distinct groups: control and LAMS; HAMS and HAMSB; and LAW and HAW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of colonic genes associated with the maintenance of genomic integrity (notably Mdm2, Top1, Msh3, Ung, Rere, Cebpa, Gmnn, and Parg) was altered and varied with RS source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HAW is as effective as HAMS and HAMSB in opposing diet-induced colonic DNA damage in rats, but their effects on the large bowel microbiota and colonocyte gene expression differ, possibly due to the presence of other fiber components in HAW </plain></SENT>
