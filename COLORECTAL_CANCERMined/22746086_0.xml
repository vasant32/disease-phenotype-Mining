<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, surgical therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is a generally accepted therapeutic approach that has been proven to extend long term patient survival with acceptable perioperative morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to retrospectively analyse a group of patients who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> over a period of ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2000 to 2009, 39 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> underwent surgical therapy at the site of the authors, out of whom 21 were males (53.8%), with a mean age of 60.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of the total, 24 patients (61.5%) presented with solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were found in the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>8 patients (20.5%) bileral affection was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>34 patients (87.2%) underwent adjuvant oncological therapy of a radically surgically curable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> before metastasectomy and 6 patients (15.4%) underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients in the group (12.8%) had both pulmonary and secondary liver affections at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median disease-free period after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> surgery was 27 months in the whole group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, we performed 31 unilateral (79.5%) and 8 bilateral (20.5%) one- or two- step surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common type of surgery included anatomical pulmonary resections (18 procedures), laser excisions (13 procedures) and wedge resections (9 procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In total, we performed 73 radical resections of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and 5 metastases were treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Metastatic affection of hilar lymph nodes was found in three patients (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perioperative morbidity reached 12.8%, mortality was zero, and two re-operations were required because of complications (5.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>53.8% of patients with metastasectomy are still alive, the median survival time is 38 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The three-year survival rate is 52% and the five-year survival rate is 41% five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pre-operatively increased value of tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15841">polypeptid</z:chebi> specific antigen (TPS) was the only statistically significant factor that had a negative impact on the overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>30.7% of patients with metastasectomy show no disease progression, the median disease- free interval is 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There is a statistically significant correlation between DFI (Disease Free Interval) following metastasectomy and the type of surgery and the lowest value of DFI was achieved with radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The risk of disease progression is 3.4-times higher in patients with two and more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> up to 3.9-times higher in subjects with three and more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The positive effect of pulmonary metastasectomy on the long-term survival is evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, careful selection of patients with individual evaluation of each single case is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In particular, indication for metastasectomy should be carefuly considered in cases of multiple affection, which are associated with higher risk of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The essential requirement is to achieve complete resection of the pathological focus, with a maximum effort aimed at sparing healthy pulmonary tissue, which allows for potential necessary reoperations in case of the disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy (SMLA) should be an integral part of any pulmonary metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
