<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis compared the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with or without panitumumab in the two trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with mCRC were randomised to FOLFOX (first-line trial) or FOLFIRI (second-line trial)Â±panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EuroQoL 5-Dimensions Health State Index (EQ-5D HSI) and Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D VAS) were assessed at baseline and monthly follow-up until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC with baseline and post-baseline HRQoL scores were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Difference in change from baseline between treatment groups was evaluated using linear mixed and pattern-mixture models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first-line trial, 576 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC (284 panitumumab+FOLFOX4 and 292 FOLFOX4 alone) were included in the HRQoL analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second-line trial, 530 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC were included in these analyses (263 panitumumab+FOLFIRI and 267 FOLFIRI alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the change in EQ-5D HSI and VAS scores between treatment groups in either trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of panitumumab to FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI in first- or second-line treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC significantly improved progression-free survival without compromising HRQoL </plain></SENT>
