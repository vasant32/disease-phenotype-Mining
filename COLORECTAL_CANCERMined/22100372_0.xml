<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the inclusion of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) involving faecal tagging and no <z:chebi fb="35" ids="50503">laxatives</z:chebi> on the computed tomography (CT) study routinely used in staging patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CTC was performed on 25 patients who had a diagnosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, with pathological correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Researchers recorded the accuracy of the CTC for staging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, as well as any changes to the plans for surgery based on this exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients' tolerance of the preparation required and the quality of the exams was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> exams were well-tolerated, and only one had unsatisfactory quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CTC identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and had an overall accuracy of 80%, 60.1% and 100% for the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> depth, lymph nodes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CTC identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> greater than 9 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following CTC, changes to surgical plans were observed in 20.8% of the cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with incomplete optical colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTC proved useful for the pre-operative evaluation of patients with a diagnosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, affecting plans for surgery in a expressive number of patients with an incomplete colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
