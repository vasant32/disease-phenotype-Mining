<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advances in this field are mainly due to enhanced processing capacity of computers, availability of specific software to perform the necessary tasks, and refined mathematical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of ten strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening, as well as no screening, incorporating quality of life, noncompliance and data on the costs and profit of chemotherapy in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a Markov model to measure the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of a 50-year-old average-risk Iranian without screening and with screening by each test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we tested the model with data from the Ministry of Health and published literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We considered costs from the perspective of a health insurance organization, with inflation to 2011, the Iranian Rial being converted into US dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We focused on three tests for the 10 strategies considered currently being used for population screening in some Iranians provinces (Kerman, Golestan Mazandaran, Ardabil, and Tehran): low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed annually; fecal immunochemical test, performed annually; and colonoscopy, performed every 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These strategies reduced the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by 39%, 60% and 76%, and mortality by 50%, 69% and 78%, respectively, compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These approaches generated ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) of $9067, $654 and $8700 per QALY (quality-adjusted life year), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the influence of various scales on the economic evaluation of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results were sensitive to probabilistic sensitivity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy every ten years yielded the greatest net health value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> is economical and cost-effective over conventional levels of WTP8 </plain></SENT>
