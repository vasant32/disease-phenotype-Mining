<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the United States, of approximately 250,000 colectomies each year, only 5% to 15% of these cases are being done laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic colorectal surgery can be performed successfully on patients for both benign and malignant conditions in any anatomic location of the colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The COST trial definitively established that laparoscopic colon surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> had similar rates of local recurrence and survival compared to open surgery, with better short-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It demonstrated that laparoscopic resections resulted in shorter hospital stays, decreased IV narcotics and oral <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi>, and improved quality of life within two weeks of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the authors' clinical experience of more than 1500 laparoscopic surgeries, patients who undergo laparoscopic colorectal surgery experience decreased rates of wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the challenges of laparoscopic colorectal surgery is standardizing these complex, minimally invasive procedures in the operating room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With standard techniques, one can create optimal outcomes for patients, minimizing perioperative complications and maximizing oncologic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This paper describes a sequenced step approach for each procedure to facilitate this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left colectomy follows a nine-step process, and right colectomy follows a four-step process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both of these procedures are described in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The newest horizon in minimally invasive surgery is single incision surgery, which allows for colorectal resections through a single 2.5 cm incision, producing an excellent cosmetic result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on this chapter, we advocate the laparoscopic approach be used as the primary method for colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
