<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the benefit of surgery and the criteria for the inclusion of patients developing hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> are not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the outcome for patients who undergo surgery for both hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, to present a set of preoperative criteria for use in patient selection, and to analyze potential prognostic factors related to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This was an observational study with retrospective analysis of data collected with a prospective protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: This investigation was conducted at a tertiary centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Between January 1996 and January 2010, of 319 patients who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 44 also had resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A set of strict selection criteria established by a panel of liver surgeons, chest surgeons, oncologists, and radiologists was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate analyses were performed to evaluate potential prognostic factors for survival, including variables related to patient, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e>, hepatic, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 44 patients received a total of 53 pulmonary resections: 36 patients had 1, 7 patients had 2, and 1 patient had 3 resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no postoperative mortality and the morbidity rate after pulmonary resection was 1.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 93% at 1 year, 81% at 3 years, and 64% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Factors related to poor prognosis in the univariate analysis were presence of more than 1 pulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p = 0.04), invasion of the surgical margin (p = 0.006), and administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.01 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> and p = 0.02 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by its observational nature and the relatively small number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> selected according to strict inclusion criteria, surgical treatment performed in a specialized center is a safe option that offers prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
