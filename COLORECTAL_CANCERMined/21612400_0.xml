<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have been performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) lesions and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> (AP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify mtDNA mutations in the cancerous and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> of Egyptian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the mutations found in six regions of the mtDNA genome (ND1, ND5, COI, tRNAser, D-loop 1, and 2) in 80 Egyptian patients (40 CRC, 20 UC, and 20 AP) was performed using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism techniques and followed up by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of mutations was 25%, 25%, and 35% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, UC, and AP cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was no common mutation pattern within each group, a large number of mutations were detected in the D-loop region in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some mutations (e.g., T414G) were detected repeatedly in precancerous (UC and AP) and cancerous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations detected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were predominantly found in the ND1 gene (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary study suggests that Egyptian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have a large number of mtDNA mutations, especially in the D-loop region, which have not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the mtDNA of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> (i.e., AP and UC) may contribute to transformation events that lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
