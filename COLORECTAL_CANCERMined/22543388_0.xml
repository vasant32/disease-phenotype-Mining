<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH APPROACH: A qualitative, descriptive approach involving focus groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A community healthcare clinic in Baltimore, MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 14 African American men and women aged 40 or older with at least one first-degree family member affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: In-depth focus groups were conducted until thematic saturation was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thematic analysis and data reduction were conducted using ATLAS.ti, version 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening barriers and facilitators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The participants were mostly male, insured, and had a parent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Commonly reported barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening included fear of serious illness, mistrust of the medical establishment, potential screening discomfort, lack of information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors, lack of healthcare access, absence of symptoms, no knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening benefits, community reticence about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> myths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Facilitating factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening included a belief of personal risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, physician recommendations, and acknowledgment of age as a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Suggestions to increase screening rates included distribution of culturally appropriate and community-based efforts (e.g., mobile units, church-based interventions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Participants also suggested ways to increase motivation and provide social support for screening patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Additional research is needed to identify and test effective screening approaches for this underserved group at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Study results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk and screening education, coupled with screening opportunities in the community, may yield increased screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Lack of knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening exists in the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Promoting screening across generations, developing and disseminating culturally appropriate educational materials within the community, and encouraging older individuals to screen to take care of their family may be appropriate interventions </plain></SENT>
