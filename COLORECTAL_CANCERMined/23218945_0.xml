<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate which modifiable factors, directly related to the endoscopic procedure, influenced the ADR in screening colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational, nested study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Multicenter, randomized, controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Asymptomatic people aged 50 to 69 years were eligible for a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial designed to compare colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 4539 individuals undergoing a direct screening colonoscopy were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Bowel cleansing, sedation, withdrawal time in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopies, and cecal intubation were analyzed as possible predictors of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection by using logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age and sex, factors independently related to the ADR were a mean withdrawal time longer than 8 minutes (odds ratio [OR] 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.96) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopies and split preparation (OR 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01-1.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, only withdrawal time maintained statistical significance in the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, withdrawal time and cecal intubation maintained independent statistical significance, whereas only withdrawal time longer than 8 minutes and a &lt;10-hour period between the end of preparation and colonoscopy showed independent associations for distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Only endoscopic variables have been analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Withdrawal time was the only modifiable factor related to the ADR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening colonoscopies associated with an increased detection rate of overall, advanced, proximal, and distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
