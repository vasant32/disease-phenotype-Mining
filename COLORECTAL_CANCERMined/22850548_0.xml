<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: When anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibody bevacizumab is applied in neoadjuvant treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, 5-6 weeks between last bevacizumab dose and liver resection are currently recommended to avoid complications in wound and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context, we aimed to determine whether VEGF is inactivated by bevacizumab at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> received neoadjuvant chemotherapy Â± bevacizumab supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The last dose of bevacizumab was administered 6 weeks before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma, subcutaneous and intraabdominal wound fluid were analysed for VEGF content before and after liver resection (day 1-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation was applied to determine the amount of bevacizumab-bound VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bevacizumab-treated individuals showed no increase in perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the entire monitoring period, plasma VEGF was inactivated by bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In wound fluid, VEGF was also completely bound by bevacizumab and was remarkably low compared with the control chemotherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data document that following a cessation time of 6 weeks, bevacizumab is fully active and blocks circulating and local VEGF at the time of liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, despite effective VEGF inactivation no increase in perioperative morbidity is recorded suggesting that VEGF activity is not essential in the immediate postoperative recovery period </plain></SENT>
