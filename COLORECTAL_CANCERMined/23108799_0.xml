<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Igf2, insulin 2 (Ins2), and H19 genes form a cluster of imprinted genes on chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-FISH protocol to detect Igf2as and Igf2 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-FISH were confirmed with quantitative real-time PCR and clearly indicate that the Igf2as transcripts are predominantly located in the cytoplasm of C2C12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a polysome association study, we showed that the Igf2as sedimented with polysomes in a <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cellular localization of Igf2as transcripts together with polysome fractionation analysis provides compelling evidence that the Igf2as is protein coding </plain></SENT>
