<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, 6 to 8 biopsies are recommended for diagnosis of a suspected malignant lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, multiple biopsies may result in several problems, such as an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, procedure prolongation, and increased workload to pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the optimal number of endoscopic biopsy specimens required in diagnosis of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who were diagnosed with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> during endoscopy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five specimens were obtained sequentially from viable tissue of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experienced pathologists evaluated each specimen and provided diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 91 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine subjects had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, and 32 had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive diagnosis rates of the first, second, and third advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> specimens were 81.3%, 94.9%, and 98.3%, respectively, while positive diagnosis rates of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> specimens were 78.1%, 87.5%, and 93.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further biopsies did not increase positive diagnosis cumulative rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that three specimens were sufficient to make correct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathologic diagnoses</z:e> in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend 3 or 4 biopsies from viable tissue in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> to make a pathologic diagnosis during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
