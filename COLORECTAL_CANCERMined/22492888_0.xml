<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured the quality of outpatient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care, using validated quality measures, in a consortium of thirty-six outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practices in Michigan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discovered that throughout the measurement period, for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> care, there was a more than 85 percent rate of adherence to quality care processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For end-of-life care processes, the adherence rate was 73 percent, and for symptom and toxicity management care processes, adherence was 56 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, we found variations in care around the fundamental oncologic task of management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address quality gaps, we developed interventions to improve adherence to treatment guidelines, improve pain management, and incorporate palliative care into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that statewide consortia that assume much of the cost burden of quality improvement activities can bring together <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> providers and payers to measure quality and design interventions to improve care </plain></SENT>
