<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 2002, colonoscopy was introduced as a tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-term objective was to reduce the incidence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) by detection and removal of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, the effect of colonoscopy screening on the population-based incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Germany is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We provide data on stage-specific (age-standardized) incidence rates in three federal states in Germany, 6 years after the implementation of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2008 a statistically significant decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence could be observed (annually 3.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.8; -2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decline could be observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> categories (T2, T3, and T4), whereas the incidence of in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (Tis) increased annually by 51.6% (95% CI: 28.0; 79.4) until 2004, and remained stable until 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The observed changes cannot be attributed definitively to the screening activities, but the presented data support a possible causal association </plain></SENT>
