<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adequate nodal harvest (â‰¥ 12 lymph nodes) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has been shown to optimize staging and proposed as a quality indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An audit within a single health district in Nova Scotia, Canada presented and published in 2002, revealed that adequate nodal harvest occurred in only 22% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this current study was to identify factors associated with adequate nodal harvest, and specifically to examine the impact of the audit and feedback strategy on nodal harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This population-based study included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing resection for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Nova Scotia, Canada, from 01 January 2001 to 31 December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage of the provincial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry with other databases (hospital discharge, physician claims data, and national census data) provided clinicodemographic, diagnostic, and treatment-event data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with adequate nodal harvest were examined using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specific interaction between year and health district was examined to identify any potential effect of dissemination of the previously-performed audit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 2,322 patients, the median nodal harvest was 8; overall, 719 (31%) had an adequate nodal harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, audited health district (p &lt; 0.0001), year (p &lt; 0.0001), younger age (p &lt; 0.0001), non-emergent surgery (p &lt; 0.0001), more advanced stage (p = 0.008), and previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> history (p = 0.03) were associated with an increased likelihood of an adequate nodal harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interaction between year and audited health district was identified (p = 0.006) such that the increase in adequate nodal harvest over time was significantly greater in the audited health district </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> nodal harvest did occur over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A published audit demonstrating suboptimal nodal harvest appeared to be an effective knowledge translation tool, though more so for the audited health district, suggesting a potentially beneficial effect of audit and feedback strategies </plain></SENT>
