<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 116 patients were enrolled in this study: 33 patients older than age 70 years had laparoscopic colectomy, whereas 24 had open colectomy; 44 patients younger than age 70 years had laparoscopic colectomy and 15 of them had open colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients answered to three questionnaires about generic (EORTC QLQ C30) and disease-specific quality of life (EORTC CR29) and about treatment satisfaction (EORTC IN-PATSAT32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonparametric tests and forward stepwise multiple regression analysis were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One month after surgery, global quality of life (QL2 item) was significantly impaired in elderly patients who had laparoscopic colectomy compared with younger patients who had the same operation (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, role function (RF), physical function (PF), emotional function (EF), cognitive function (CF), and social function (SF) were impaired in elderly patients who had laparoscopic colectomy compared with younger patients (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.013, p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> (FA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> (SL), appetite loss (AP), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (DY) affected the quality of life of these patients more than younger patients (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.055, p��= 0.051, and p = 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> experience less postoperative local complications than elderly patients undergoing open colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in the first postoperative month, these patients experience a worse global quality of life than younger patients undergoing the same operation with impairment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the functions and the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo>, appetite loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
