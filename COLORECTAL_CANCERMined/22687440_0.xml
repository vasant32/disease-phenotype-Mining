<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fatty acyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> derivative of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> was synthesized by its conjugation to octadecylamine with the expectation to improve its loading capacity in NLCs of 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NLCs were prepared by an emulsification-solvent evaporation method using cholesterol and cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25629">stearate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical properties and drug release were studied in NLCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of NLCs loaded with 5-FU and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> conjugate was studied on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells (HT29) using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To confirm that drug targeting has been done through <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptors, <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-E was omitted from the cell culture and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FTIR and (1)H NMR spectra confirmed successful production of the conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed the IC(50) of free 5-FU was about 7.6 Î¼M while in comparable concentration, the cytotoxicity of 5-FU loaded in NLCs containing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> conjugate was nearly 2 fold of NLCs just loaded with 5-FU and more than 5 fold of free 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> conjugate loaded NLCs prepared by cholesterol can target <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptors of HT29 cells and seems promising in reducing 5-FU dose in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
