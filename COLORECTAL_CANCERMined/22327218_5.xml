<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The founding member, E2F-1, is endowed with contradictory activities, being able to promote cell-cycle progression and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms that underlie the opposing outcomes of E2F-1 activation remain largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that E2F-1 is directly methylated by PRMT5 (protein arginine methyltransferase 5), and that arginine methylation is responsible for regulating its biochemical and functional properties, which impacts on E2F-1-dependent growth control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, depleting PRMT5 causes increased E2F-1 protein levels, which coincides with <z:mp ids='MP_0001732'>decreased growth rate</z:mp> and associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arginine methylation influences E2F-1 protein stability, and the enhanced transcription of a variety of downstream target genes reflects increased E2F-1 DNA-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, E2F-1 is methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, and a reduced level of methylation is evident under DNA damage conditions that allow E2F-1 stabilization and give rise to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly, in a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, high levels of PRMT5 frequently coincide with low levels of E2F-1 and reflect a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results establish that arginine methylation regulates the biological activity of E2F-1 activity, and raise the possibility that arginine methylation contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumourigenesis</z:e> by influencing the E2F pathway </plain></SENT>
