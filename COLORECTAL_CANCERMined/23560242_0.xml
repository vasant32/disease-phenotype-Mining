<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many studies have provided evidence for an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, physical inactivity, and western diet as risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies directly address the association between type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) and the risk of colorectal lesions at specific anatomic locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2,663 subjects with a previous history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>(s) and removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> current <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at study entry were followed for a mean time of three years across three different chemoprevention clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence and number of lesions during the treatment phase; the secondary endpoints were presence of advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (CRN) and location of CRN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using log linear regression, the effect of DM status on the relative risk (RR) of CRN recurrence, advanced CRN, and location of CRN was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DM status was not significantly associated with incidence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, incidence of advanced colorectal lesions, or left-sided colorectal neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with DM had a marginally increased risk of right-sided (p= 0.06) colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and a significant increased risk of multiple right-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (p=0.03) in the unadjusted model; this association was not significant after adjusting for age and other potential confounders (RR=1.22, 95% CI: 0.85-1.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We did not observe a statistically significant increased risk in CRN recurrence for overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in individuals with DM compared to non-DM individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, given the patterns observed in this investigation, future studies with longer follow-up time and longer DM exposure, incorporating objective measurements of type 2 DM might help elucidate the risk of CRN among individuals with DM </plain></SENT>
