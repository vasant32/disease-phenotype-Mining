<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been extensively connected with resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33749">platinum compounds</z:chebi>, no role has been established in 5-FU resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that p38MAPK activation is a key determinant in the cellular response to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, inhibition of p38MAPKÎ± by SB203580 compound or by short-hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference-specific knockdown correlates with a decrease in the 5-FU-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and chemical resistance in both HaCaT and HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of p38MAPK by 5-FU was dependent on canonical MAP2K, MAPK kinase (MKK)-3 and MKK6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> mutated (ATM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> and Rad3 related (ATR) showed a redundancy of function for the final activation of p38MAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resistance associated with p38MAPK inhibition correlates with an autophagic response that was mediated by a decrease in p53-driven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, without effect onto p53-dependent autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-derived cell lines with different p53 status and patterns of resistance to 5-FU suggest that de novo and acquired resistance was controlled by similar mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data demonstrate a critical role for the p38MAPK signaling pathway in the cellular response to 5-FU by controlling the balance between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and autophagy </plain></SENT>
