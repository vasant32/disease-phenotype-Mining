<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Complete bowel cleansing is mandatory for effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening and surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current pilot study, which was conducted in humans, was to test the safety and efficiency of a newly developed disposable cleaning device, the MedJet, for intraprocedural bowel cleansing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with screening or surveillance colonoscopy after previous polypectomy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The colonoscope was first inserted to the cecum and the overall cleansing was assessed according to the Ottawa scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MedJet device was used if colon cleansing had been incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MedJet catheter was passed over the working channel of the colonoscope and the colon was cleaned during withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MedJet device delivered controlled jets comprising compressed <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> and minimal amounts of <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> water, which allowed disintegration and removal of residual stool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of cleaning was assessed according to the Boston scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 32 patients (16 female; mean age 61 years) were treated with the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No device-related adverse or serious adverse events were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MedJet application during withdrawal provided effective and significant improvement in bowel cleansing (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, which were hidden behind stool remnants, could be identified in 11 patients following use of the MedJet device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the withdrawal times were prolonged (11.4Â±6.0 minutes) due to the additional cleaning procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients tolerated the procedure well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new MedJet device enabled highly effective and safe bowel cleansing during colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The catheter-based system was easy to use and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> was applied for cleansing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The procedure was well tolerated by patients </plain></SENT>
