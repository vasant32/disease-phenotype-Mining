<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The enhanced recovery program (ERP) aims to reduce the metabolic response to surgery, hastening recovery and shortening hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerns exist regarding morbidity and hospital stay in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to compare the outcomes and compliance of elderly patients managed by an ERP protocol with a younger group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A review was performed of a prospective database of patients undergoing colorectal resection managed under the ERP protocol between 2005 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped into &lt;80 years and ≥ 80 years, and perioperative data were collated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative outcomes were compared with the goals set out by the ERP protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 688 patients were included, 558 were &lt;80 years (median: 66 years; range: 17-79 years) and 130 were ≥ 80 years (median: 83 years; range: 80-95 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some 96% of operations were planned laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median total length of hospital stay was 6 days (range: 1-108 days) for the &lt;80 year group and 8 days (range: 1-167 days; P 0.363) for the elderly group, with a 30 day readmission rate of 8.6% for the population and no significant differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 30 day mortality was 5%, with a significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences in protocol adherence were identified in the discontinuation of intravenous fluids, catheter removal, and early mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An enhanced recovery program is feasible for colorectal surgery patients ≥ 80 years of age, with similar compliance as the younger group to some aspects of the protocol and an acceptable readmission rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Attention to improving compliance in the postoperative phase is necessary, particularly in such high-risk patients, as such improvement may reduce the morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
