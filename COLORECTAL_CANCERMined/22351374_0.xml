<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study's purpose was to investigate the impact of comorbid conditions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A stage-matched randomized clinical trial was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic African Americans over age 50, with a primary care physician, and eligible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were recruited at The Mount Sinai Hospital from 2005 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-one patients were assessed for referral for, and completion of, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, comorbid conditions, "readiness to change," and number of physician visits within the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data was compared to a pretrial index to predict the likely effect of comorbid conditions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-nine patients completed the study; 108 (68.9%) were referred for and 34 (21.2%) completed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No demographic characteristics were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening referrals were similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, regardless of comorbidities or clinical visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comorbidities rated as having extreme influence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening showed a trend toward lower screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in screening rates among participants in advanced stages of readiness at enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that while comorbidities did not predict colonoscopy completion, they may play a role in concert with other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the only study to assess the effect of screening colonoscopy in an African American primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We must continue to explore interventions to narrow the disparate gap in screening and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
