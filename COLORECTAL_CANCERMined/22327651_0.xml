<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To derive a more precise estimation of the association, we conducted this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, with the last report up to May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 individual studies including 8,219 cases and 11,498 controls based on the search criteria were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis was performed for slow versus rapid acetylation genotypes of NAT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no association between NAT1 polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in overall population (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.88-1.05 P = 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) without significant publication bias present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses, similar results were found in different ethnicities, source of controls, genotyping methods and adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current meta-analysis suggests that lack of association between the NAT1 polymorphisms and individual risk to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
