<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relationship between the diagnostic interval and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This association was examined by taking account of important confounding factors at the time of first presentation of symptoms in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 268 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were included in a prospective, population-based study in a Danish county </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic interval was defined as the time from first presentation of symptoms until diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed patients separately according to the general practitioner's interpretation of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to estimate 3-year mortality odds ratios as a function of the diagnostic interval using restricted cubic splines and adjusting for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> site, comorbidity, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or any other serious illness, the risk of dying within 3 years decreased with diagnostic intervals up to 5 weeks and then increased (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients presenting with vague symptoms, the association was reverse, although not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in primary care is two sided: aimed at expediting ill patients while preventing healthy people from going to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This likely explains the counterintuitive findings; but it does not explain the increasing mortality with longer diagnostic intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study provides evidence for the hypothesis that the length of the diagnostic interval affects mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
