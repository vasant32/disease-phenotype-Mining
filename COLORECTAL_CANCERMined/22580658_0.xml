<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: The current standard chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> is the FOLFOX or the FOLFIRI regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these regimens include the continuous infusion of an anticancer agent, chemotherapy is possible by using implantable central venous port systems with a portable disposable pump in an outpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is an evaluation of the usefulness of implantable central venous port systems for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: An implantable central venous port system was placed in 93 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received modified FOLFOX6 ± bevacizumab or FOLFIRI ± bevacizumab regimens via the port system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up continued for each patient until removal of the port system, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or unavailability of further information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence and details of the complications were investigated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 1,246 treatments, a total of 16 incidents of port system-related complications were identified (1.28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidents involved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (n=12), catheter pinch off (n=2), fibrin sheath (n=1) and drug leakage (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A port system removal was required in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Implantable central venous port systems are safe and have a low long-term complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We consider port systems, such as modified FOLFOX6 ± bevacizumab or FOLFIRI ± bevacizumab regimens, useful for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
