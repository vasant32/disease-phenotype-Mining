<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Heterocyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxides</z:chebi> are an interesting class of antitumor agents that selectively kill the hypoxic cells found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-selective activity of the lead compound in this class, tirapazamine, stems from its ability to undergo intracellular one-electron reduction to an oxygen-sensitive drug radical intermediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the presence of molecular oxygen, the radical intermediate is back-oxidized to the parent molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under hypoxic conditions, the extended lifetime of the drug radical intermediate enables its conversion to a highly cytotoxic DNA-damaging intermediate via a "deoxygenative" mechanism involving the loss of oxygen from one of its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxide</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The natural product myxin is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36674">phenazine</z:chebi> di-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxide</z:chebi> that displays potent antibiotic activity against a variety of organisms under aerobic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In light of the current view of heterocyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxides</z:chebi> as agents that selectively operate under hypoxic conditions, it is striking that myxin was identified from Sorangium extracts based upon its antibiotic properties under aerobic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we set out to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of myxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We find that myxin causes bioreductively activated, radical-mediated DNA strand cleavage under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our evidence indicates that strand cleavage occurs via a deoxygenative metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We show that myxin displays potent cytotoxicity against the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line HCT-116 under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions that is comparable to the cell-killing properties of tirapazamine under anaerobic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This work sheds light on the processes by which the naturally occurring aromatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxide</z:chebi> myxin gains its potent antibiotic properties under aerobic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these studies highlight the general potential for aromatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxides</z:chebi> to undergo highly cytotoxic deoxygenative metabolism following enzymatic one-electron reduction under aerobic conditions </plain></SENT>
