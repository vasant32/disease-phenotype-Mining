<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 31 men (median age 65, range 48-75 years) with confirmed Dukes' B colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were recorded: age of the patients (years), baseline CEA serum levels (ng/ml), Ki-67 and p53 expression (%), and survival (months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean overall survival was 37.3 ± 13.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean baseline CEA serum level was 79 ± 7.4 ng/ml, while the percentage positivity for Ki-67 and p53 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues was 46.9 ± 19.2 and 48.7 ± 14.2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between Ki-67 and p53 expression (R=0.82, p&lt;0.001) and an inverse relationship between survival and the expression of both Ki-67 (R=-0.67, p&lt;0.001) and p53 (R=-0.64, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between survival and age (R=0.22, p=0.22) or CEA (R=0.08, p=0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between CEA and age (R=0.34, p=0.06), Ki-67 (R=-0.021, p=0.90) or p53 (R=0.03, p=0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our preliminary results showed that both Ki-67 and p53 overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are associated with a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this selected group of patients, these prognostic markers were independent of age, and the preoperative CEA serum levels did not have any relationship with survival </plain></SENT>
