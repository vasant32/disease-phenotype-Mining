<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found a widespread disruption in miRNA expression during colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis; of the 161 miRNAs altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent tissue samples, miR-31 was the most significantly dysregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified candidate targets of miR-31 using bioinformatics approaches and validated <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> p21 GTPase activating protein 1 (RASA1) as a direct target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, we found an inverse correlation between miR-31 and RASA1 protein levels in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, in vitro evidence demonstrated that RASA1 expression was significantly decreased by treatment with pre-miR-31-LV, whereas anti-miR-31-LV treatment increased RASA1 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Third, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-31 directly recognizes a specific location within the 3'-untranslated region of RASA1 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the biological consequences of miR-31 targeting RASA1 were examined by the cell proliferation assay in vitro and by the immunodeficient mouse xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that miR-31 plays a significant role in activating the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> signaling pathway through the inhibition of RASA1 translation, thereby improving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell growth and stimulating <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
