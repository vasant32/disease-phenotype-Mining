<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major problems that prevent its approval as therapeutic agent are its low water solubility and its relatively low in vivo bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liposomes are considered as effective drug carriers because of their ability to solubilize hydrophobic compounds and to alter their pharmacokinetic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was the development of lyophilised liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> fully characterized in terms of its physical properties [(zeta-potential, size, size distribution and Polydispercity index (PI)], and to evaluate its in vitro cytotoxic against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines in a short-term and in a long-term (clonogenic) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> was incorporated in egg-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (EPC) liposomes at a drug to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> molar ratio 1:14 achieving high incorporation efficiency close to 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> was lyophilized preserving thus its stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reconstitution of the formulation resulted in the original liposomal suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The release in FBS showed a plateau near 14% at 96 hours of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The in vitro studies against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines have shown that liposomes improve the activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> especially in the long-term assay and the liposomal formulation found to be more potent against HCT116 and HCT15, cell lines which express the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EPC liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in a molar ratio of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>/EPC 1:14 has shown improved cytotoxic activity versus free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
