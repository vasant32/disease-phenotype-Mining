<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ER-β gene <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> (ESR2 CA) repeat polymorphism was reported to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, although showing contradicting results probably caused by ethnicity or age distribution of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between this polymorphism and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in a community-based case-control study in Japan (685 cases/778 controls), including only subjects younger than 75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect modifications of the body mass index (BMI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> intake were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ESR2 CA repeat polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-labeled primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CA repeat alleles were classified into short (S) allele (&lt;22 repeats) and long (L) allele (≥ 22 repeats) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> associated with the L allele were more evident among postmenopausal women with low BMI (&lt;25 kg m(-2)) or with high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
