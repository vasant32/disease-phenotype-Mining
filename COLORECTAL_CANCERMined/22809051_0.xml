<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">Benzimidazole</z:chebi> derivatives are structurally bioisosteres of naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, which makes them compatible with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33694">biopolymers</z:chebi> of living systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This property gives <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi> a biological and clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, this class of compounds has been reported to possess anti-allergic, anti-diabatic, anti-HIV, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-mycobacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-protozoal, and anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The researchers are now interested to explore their potential as anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, an effort was made to further explore this area of research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in order to increase the solubility and efficacy of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5686">heterocycles</z:chebi>, the interest is now shifted to the salts of these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With this background, we planned to synthesize a series of meta-xylyl linked bis-benzimidazolium salts to assess their anti-proliferation efficacy on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line (HCT 116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A number of N-alkylbenzimidazoles were synthesized by reactions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24469">alkyl halides</z:chebi> (i-PrBr, PrBr, EthBr, Pent-2-ylBr, BuBr, BenzCl, HeptBr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subsequent treatment of the resulting N-alkylbenzimidazoles with 1,3-(bromomethylene)<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> afforded corresponding bis-benzimidazolium salts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> synthesized compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques (Additional file 1: NMR &amp; FT-IR) and microanalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="24431">Molecular structures</z:chebi> of selected compounds were established through single crystal x-ray diffraction studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the compounds were assessed for their anti-proliferation test on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line (HCT 116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the compounds exhibited dose dependent cytotoxicity towards the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with IC50 ranges between 0.1 to 17.6 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The anti-proliferation activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compounds was more pronounced than that of standard reference drug 5-flourouracil (IC50 =19.2 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the synthesized bis-benzimidazolium salts showed potential anticancer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Out of them, some of these salts showed IC50 value as low as 0.1-0.2 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Based on the results it can be concluded that, the bis-benzimidazolium salts could probably be the potential source of chemotherapeutic drugs </plain></SENT>
