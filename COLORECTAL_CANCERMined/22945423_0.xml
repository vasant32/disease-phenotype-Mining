<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of PTCH1 in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, however, is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate epigenetic modifications of PTCH1 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF), the earliest precursor lesion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using laser-capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>), a pure population of ACF epithelial cells was isolated and studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inherent protein expression levels of SHH, PTCH1, SMO and GLI1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry for 405 ACF, including 54 dysplastic ACF (d-ACF) and 351 non-dysplastic ACF (n-ACF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and methylation status of PTCH1 were also determined in 54 d-ACF and 96 n-ACF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that the expression of SHH, SMO and GLI1 was significantly up-regulated in d-ACF, compared to n-ACF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of PTCH1 were lower in d-ACF than n-ACF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using MSP or MS-HRM, PTCH1 methylation was present in 64.8% (35/54) or 63.3% (34/54), respectively, of d-ACF and 19.8% (19/96) or 22.9% (11/48), respectively, of n-ACF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PTCH1 methylation was more frequent in d-ACF than n-ACF (p &lt; 0.001) and was associated with PTCH1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (r = 0.358, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant correlation between PTCH1 methylation status and the prevalence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study suggests that aberrant methylation of the PTCH1 promoter may be an early, initiating event of colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
