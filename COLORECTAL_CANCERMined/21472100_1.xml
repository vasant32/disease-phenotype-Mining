<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty four consecutive patients (20 men and 14 women; mean age: 63 years) with a histologically proven diagnosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and scheduled for surgery in our hospital were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent FDG-PET/CT preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> site and extent were evaluated on PET/CT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colorectal wall invasion was analysed according to a modified T classification that considers only three stages (â‰¤ T2, T3, T4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessment of accuracy was carried out using 95% confidence intervals for T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty five/37 (94.6%) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were identified and correctly located on PET/CT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PET/CT correctly staged the T of 33/35 lesions identified showing an accuracy of 94.3% (95% CI: 87%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> T1, T3 and T4 lesions were correctly staged, while two T2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were overstated as T3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that FDG-PET/CT may be an accurate modality for identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and defining its local extent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
