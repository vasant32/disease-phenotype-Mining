<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: BRD7 is a member of bromodomain-containing protein and was found to be a cofactor of P53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of BRD7 has been shown in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines and tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical role of BRD7 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time PCR, Western blotting analysis and immunohistochemistry were employed to examine BRD7 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines/tissues compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelia cells/adjacent non-tumorous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, statistical analyses were applied to evaluate the diagnostic value and associations of BRD7 expression with clinical parameters of patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BRD7 was down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines and cancerous tissues compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon epithelial cells and adjacent noncancerous tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BRD7 protein expression was positively correlated with clinical stage (P  &lt;  0·001), T classification (P  =  0·001), N classification (P  &lt;  0·001), M classification (P &lt;  0·001) and pathologic differentiation (P =  0·008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with low/none BRD7 expression had shorter overall survival time than those with higher BRD7 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated BRD7 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BRD7 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
