<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression, the risk of early/missed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> was three times as high for IBD patients (Crohn's odds ratio (OR), 3.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.23-4.21; UC OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 2.44-3.81) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Older IBD patients had a higher rate of early/missed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> after colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
