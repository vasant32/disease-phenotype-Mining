<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous research has mainly focused on demographic and medical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because little is known about the role of psychosocial variables in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e>, this research sought to identify the contribution of demographic, medical, and psychosocial factors to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> using multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male and female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors (N = 261; mean, 2.5 years post-treatment) completed paper-pencil questionnaires assessing sexual function, psychosocial variables (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, social support, body image, and dyadic adjustment), and demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical information was obtained from patients' self-report and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses revealed that older age, having received destructive surgery (i.e., abdominoperineal resection), and poor social support were uniquely and significantly associated with low international index of erectile function scores in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For women, low female sexual function index scores were significantly associated with older age and poor global quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men, but not women, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> reported worse sexual function compared to those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Sexual dysfunction</z:e> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treatment is related to demographic, medical, and psychosocial factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These associations can help to identify patients at high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problems</z:e> in order to assist restoring sexual functioning if desired </plain></SENT>
