<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the risk of developing gastric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with the p53 codon 72 polymorphism in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a large-scale case-control study that included 2,213 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> patients; 1,829 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients; and 1,700 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using a TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro, and Pro/Pro genotypes of the p53 codon 72 polymorphism were 43.3, 42.0, and 13.0% in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> patients; 40.5, 45.0, and 14.0% in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients; and 43.2, 45.6, and 11.2% in the controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Pro/Pro genotype was associated with an increased risk of gastric [age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.56, P = 0.04] and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.72, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant interactions between the p53 codon 72 polymorphism and smoking or drinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the Pro/Pro genotype is associated with modest increases in the risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
