<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among specific Asian American groups are limited despite the fact that Asians are comprised of culturally distinct subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of cultural characteristics on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening adherence among Filipinos in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and seventeen Filipino men and women aged 50 years or older participated in the cross-section research design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lifetime proportion of immigration, language preference and cultural beliefs of personal control regarding health outcomes measured cultural characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and healthcare variables were also measured to describe the study sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participant recruitment employed culturally responsive sampling methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant association between language preference and screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, perceived personal internal control of health outcome was not related to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, personal external control revealed a marginally significant association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percent of lifetime residence in the United States was significantly greater among those who were adherent to screening than those who were not adherent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for demographic and healthcare variables, the relationship between length of immigration and screening adherence was no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, age and doctor's recommendation showed significant impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This pilot study adds to the knowledge regarding cultural factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening behaviors among Filipino Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future research is needed to confirm findings that will be useful in developing culturally appropriate strategies to increase screening adherence </plain></SENT>
