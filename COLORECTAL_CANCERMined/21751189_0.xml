<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of concern are possible disparities in uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening between white and African American men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to assess for disparities in uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among men participating in a high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If present, such disparities could support hypotheses for further research examining racial differences in awareness and patient preferences in undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline data on a racially diverse cohort of men aged 50 to 69 years at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> collected via the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>Prostate Cancer</z:hpo> Risk Assessment Program at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fox</z:e> Chase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictors of uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were assessed using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with whites, African American men had statistically significantly lower uptake of fecal occult blood testing (African American 49.0% vs white 60.7%, P = .035), lower endoscopy (African American 44.1% vs white 58.5%, P = .011), and any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (African American 66.2% vs white 76.3%, P = .053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Predictors of uptake of lower endoscopy among African American men included older age (odds ratio [OR], 3.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.87-6.97), family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.30-9.25), and insurance status (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.04-3.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk and motivation to seek <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> screening through a specialized <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> risk assessment program, evidence supporting compliance gaps with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among men was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tailored messages to younger African American men with and without a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are needed </plain></SENT>
