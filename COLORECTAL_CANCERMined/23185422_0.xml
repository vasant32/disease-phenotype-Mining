<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phenolic compounds, especially abundant in berries, are of interest due to their putative anticancer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After consumption, however, phenolic compounds are subject to digestive conditions within the gastrointestinal tract that alter their structures and potentially their function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of phenolic compounds are not efficiently absorbed in the small intestine and a substantial portion pass into the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We characterized berry extracts (raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrants) produced by in vitro-simulated upper intestinal tract digestion and subsequent fecal fermentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These extracts and selected individual colonic metabolites were then evaluated for their putative anticancer activities using in vitro models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, representing the key stages of initiation, promotion and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a physiologically-relevant dose range (0-50 Âµg/ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30778">gallic acid</z:chebi> equivalents), the digested and fermented extracts demonstrated significant anti-genotoxic, anti-mutagenic and anti-invasive activity on colonocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This work indicates that phenolic compounds from berries undergo considerable structural modifications during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract but their breakdown products and metabolites retain biological activity and can modulate cellular processes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
