<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To screen the differential expressed genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue specimens containing 16 cases of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosae were collected and subjected to cDNA microarray and bioinformatical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm some of the cDNA microarray data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The experimental data showed that eight genes were differentially expressed, most of which were upregulated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-six genes expressions were altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, of which 29 were upregulated and 17 downregulated, as compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 18 genes were similarly altered in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the cDNA microarray data for four of those 18 genes: MTA1, PDCD4, TSC1 and PDGFRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These differentially expressed genes likely represent biomarkers for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and may be potential therapeutic targets after confirmed by further studies </plain></SENT>
