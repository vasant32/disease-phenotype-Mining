<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our experience of solo surgery using the voice-guided robotic arm in laparoscopic colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The colon-lifting method was used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The laparoscope was handled by AESOP3000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The colon was retracted anteriorly by the thread that passed through the mesocolon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method enables lymphadenectomy by stretching of feeding vessels and obviates the need for an assistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The short-term outcomes and survival between robotic arm and human scopist in a series of laparoscopic colectomies were compared with a case-matched control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The numbers of both group patients were 11 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no conversion to open surgery in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operation time (Robotic vs. Human=269 min. vs. 265) and laparoscopic time (209 vs. 212) were not significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were also no significant differences in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, the morbidity rate and the numbers of dissected lymph nodes between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The five-year overall (81.8% vs. 72.7%) and disease-free (72.7% vs. 62.3%) survivals showed no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic solo-surgery in colectomy is safe and feasible, without any deterioration of the curative potential of the procedure </plain></SENT>
