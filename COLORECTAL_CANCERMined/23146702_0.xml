<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Location: El Coto and El Llano (Gijon) primary care health centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 800 individuals aged between 40 and 75 years participated, selected by simple random sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Key measurements: questionnaire conducted by telephone with previous notice by newsletter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variables studied were: family history (FH) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, age at diagnosis, performance of faecal occult blood test (FOBT)/colonoscopy, reason for doing it or refusing it, and sociodemographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 664 questionnaires were valid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of FH was 15.8% (confidence interval 12.9 to 18.6), with 8.8% with at least one first degree relative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An FOBT screening had been performed on 7.1%, and 17.9% had undergone colonoscopies, mostly on clinical grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acceptability was 90.7% for FOBT and 65.2% for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Main reason for the refusal of an FOBT was the belief that early diagnosis would not alter prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Main reason for rejection of colonoscopy was discomfort or fear of the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was a low rate of testing for FH, and a high acceptability for FOBT and a low acceptability for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Aspects affecting the general population (causes for rejection, need for clear information), as well as a correct coordination between Primary Care, specialized care, and public health, need to be reviewed </plain></SENT>
