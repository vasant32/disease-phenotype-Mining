<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening using computerized tomographic colonography (CTC) has attracted considerable attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to better understand patient preferences for CTC versus colonoscopy, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data sources included published studies, abstracts and book chapters, in any language, with publication dates from 1995 through February 2012, and with prospective or retrospective enrollment of diagnostic or screening patients who had undergone both procedures and explicit assessment of their preference for colonoscopy versus CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A predefined algorithm identified eligible studies using computer and hand searches performed by two independent investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used a mixed effects model to pool preference differences (defined as the proportion of subjects who preferred CTC minus the proportion who preferred colonoscopy for each study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria, totaling 5616 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 16 of these studies, patients preferred CTC over colonoscopy, while colonoscopy was preferred in three studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to the high degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, an overall pooled preference difference was not calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis revealed that studies published in radiology journals (preference difference 0.590 [95 % CI 0.485, 0.694]) seemed more likely than studies in gastroenterology (0.218 [-0.015-0.451]) or general medicine journals (-0.158 [-0.389-0.072]) to report preference for CTC (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies by radiology authors showed a trend towards stronger preference for CTC compared with studies by gastroenterology authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients expressed no preference, but screening patients preferred CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in preferences between studies using "masked" and "unmasked" preference ascertainment methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three studies featuring limited bowel preparations for CTC reported marked preference for CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of publication bias, while cumulative and exclusion analysis did not show any temporal trend or dominant study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Limitations included data <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and preference ascertainment limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, most included studies reported preference for CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On stratified analysis, screening patients preferred CTC while diagnostic patients showed no preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Studies published in radiology journals showed significantly stronger preference for CTC compared with studies in gastroenterology or general medicine journals </plain></SENT>
