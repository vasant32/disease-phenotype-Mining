<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize at the molecular level Spanish families harboring EPCAM deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-commercial MLPA probes and long-range PCR amplification were used to characterize each deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Haplotyping was performed by analyzing 8 microsatellite markers and 5 MSH2 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation of MSH2 was analyzed by Methylation Specific-MLPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> diagnosed in 7 Spanish families harboring EPCAM deletions were almost exclusively colorectal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism in MSH2 methylation was observed in EPCAM deletion carrier samples, being average methylation levels higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> (27.6 and 31.1%), than in lymphocytes and oral mucosa (1.1 and 0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three families shared the deletion c.858+2568_*4596del, with a common haplotype comprising 9.9Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two families the novel EPCAM deletion c.858+2488_*7469del was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study provides knowledge on the clinical and molecular characteristics of mosaic MSH2 epimutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identification of an EPCAM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation has useful implications for the molecular diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> in Spain </plain></SENT>
