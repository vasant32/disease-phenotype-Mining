<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk and outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> after hepatic and pulmonary metastasectomy have not been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the incidence, predictive factors, treatment and survival of patients developing colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e>, who had previously undergone resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective review was carried out of a prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two (4.0%) of 1304 patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence rate was 1.03% per person-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> were found as part of multifocal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 3.2 months (95% CI: 2.3-4.1), but was best for six patients treated with potentially curative resection [median survival = 13.2 (range, 4.9-32.1) months] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that a lymph node-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.8-6.19; P = 0.019], large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (&gt; 6 cm) [HR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.19-2.33; P = 0.012] and recurrent intrahepatic and extrahepatic disease [HR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.2-4.62; P = 0.013] were independent predictors for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The annual risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> following liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> is low, but highest for patients presenting with a Dukes' C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e>, large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> or who subsequently develop disseminated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall survival from colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> is poor, but resection with curative intent offers patients their best chance of medium-term survival </plain></SENT>
