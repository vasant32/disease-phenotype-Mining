<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were only a few reports of disease outcomes in Thai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics and disease outcome of patients with curable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated at Siriraj Hospital, the largest tertiary-care hospital in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Medical records of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients diagnosed at Siriraj Hospital between January 2003 and December 2007 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The records of the patients presenting with stage I-III and had been follow-up for at least 2 years were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics, including demographic data, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> site, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TMN</z:e> staging, histopathology, and CEA level were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease outcome including survival, recurrence of disease and complication were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One thousand forty-seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were diagnosed and completely staged during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of stage I-IV was 9%, 22%, 37% and 32%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three hundred fifty-five patients with stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ratio of male and female was 1.4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median age was 59.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight percent and 52% of patients had colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 63.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean time from diagnosis to surgery was 23 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two hundred forty eight patients (70%) received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the majority receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>5-year disease free survival rate in stage I-III was 90%, 85% and 58%, respectively and 5-year overall survival in stage I-III was 93%, 93% and 73%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for disease-free survival were gender preoperative CEA and stage; for overall survival were gender and stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Approximately two-thirds (68%) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at Siriraj hospital presented with a potentially curable stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Multi-modality treatments with surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation resulted in comparable survival as in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for worse survival in this cohort were stage III disease and male gender </plain></SENT>
