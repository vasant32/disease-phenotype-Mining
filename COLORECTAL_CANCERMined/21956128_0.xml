<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Much evidence indicates the association between dietary fat and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most of the studies focus on <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, and little is known about the role of monounsaturated ones and their precise mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Being store-operated Ca²⁺ entry (SOCE) a Ca²⁺ influx pathway involved in the control of multiple cellular and physiological processes including cell proliferation, we studied the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> in Ca²⁺ signals of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, paying particular attention to SOCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">Carbachol</z:chebi> was used to induce SOCE in Fura 2-loaded HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acid</z:chebi> to compare the physiological relevance of our results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> is a potent inhibitor of SOCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">stearic acid</z:chebi> failed to have a SOCE-inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SOCE-inhibition induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> was protein kinase C-independent and restored by albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> induced increases in [Ca²⁺](i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The novelty of our report is that little variability in the concentration could end in a large different physiological effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we suggest a physiological pathway for the beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> in colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
