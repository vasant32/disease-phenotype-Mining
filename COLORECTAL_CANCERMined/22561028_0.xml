<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether area and individual measures of socio-economic status (SES) affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening participation in Singapore and prospectively evaluated an access-enhancing community-based intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents aged &gt;40 years in two housing estates comprising of owner-occupied (high-SES area) and rental (low-SES area) flats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 2009 to 2011, non-adherents to regular screening for colorectal/breast/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> were offered free convenient screening over six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-intervention screening rates were compared with McNemar's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multi-level logistic regression identified factors of regular screening at baseline; Cox regression analysis identified predictors of screening post-intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participation was 78.2% (1081/1383) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the low-SES area, 7.7% (33/427), 20.4% (44/216), and 14.3% (46/321) had regular colorectal, cervical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-intervention, screening rates in the low-SES area rose significantly to 19.0% (81/427), 25.4% (55/216), and 34.3% (74/216) respectively (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Area SES was more consistently associated with screening than individual SES at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-intervention, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, those with higher education were more likely to attend (p=0.004); for female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, the higher-income were less likely to attend (p=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Access-enhancing community-based interventions improve participation among disadvantaged strata of Asian societies </plain></SENT>
