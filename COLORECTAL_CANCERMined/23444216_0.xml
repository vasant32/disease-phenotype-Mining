<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) for the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) who have previously received an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the phase III VELOUR trial, aflibercept plus FOLFIRI statistically significantly prolonged both progression-free survival (median PFS for the aflibercept plus FOLFIRI arm was 6.90 months versus 4.67 months for the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm) and overall survival (median OS for the aflibercept plus FOLFIRI arm was 13.50 months versus 12.06 months for the placebo plus FOLFIRI arm); however, grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more common with the addition of aflibercept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of aflibercept to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (mFOLFOX6) in the phase II AFFIRM trial of first-line treatment of mCRC failed to improve PFS or response rate, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a decoy vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), aflibercept (VEGF-Trap) has binding affinity for VEGF-A, VEGF-B, PlGF-1 and PlGF-2, and this is a mechanism of significant interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Optimal strategies for incorporating aflibercept into treatment regimens that include other anti-VEGF and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, as well as development of predictive biomarkers for treatment response, have yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
