<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early detection significantly improves long-term survival for patients with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Near- infrared (NIR) fluorescent nanoparticles hold great promise as contrast agents for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NIR offers several advantages for bioimaging compared with fluorescence in the visible spectrum, ie, lower autofluorescence of biological tissues, lower absorbance, and consequently deeper penetration into biomatrices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: NIR fluorescent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50822">iron oxide nanoparticles</z:chebi> with a narrow size distribution were prepared by nucleation, followed by controlled growth of thin <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> films onto <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52295">cyanine</z:chebi> NIR dye conjugated gelatin-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For functionalization, and in order to increase the NIR fluorescence intensity, the NIR fluorescent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50822">iron oxide nanoparticles</z:chebi> obtained were coated with human serum albumin containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52295">cyanine</z:chebi> NIR dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leakage of the NIR dye from these nanoparticles into phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 4% albumin was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The work presented here is a feasibility study to test the suitability of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi>-human serum albumin NIR fluorescent nanoparticles for optical detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It demonstrates that encapsulation of NIR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> within these nanoparticles significantly reduces photobleaching of the dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>-targeting ligands, peanut agglutinin and anticarcinoembryonic antigen antibodies (αCEA), were covalently conjugated with the NIR fluorescent <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi>-human serum albumin nanoparticles via a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46793">poly(ethylene glycol)</z:chebi> spacer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> detection was demonstrated in chicken embryo and mouse models for both nonconjugated and the peanut agglutinin-conjugated or αCEA-conjugated NIR fluorescent <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi>-human serum albumin nanoparticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Conjugation of peanut agglutinin or αCEA to the nanoparticles significantly increased the fluorescence intensity of the tagged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> tissues relative to the nonconjugated nanoparticles </plain></SENT>
