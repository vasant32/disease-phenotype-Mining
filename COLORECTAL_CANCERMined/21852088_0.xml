<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although noni has been consumed for a long time in Asian and Polynesian countries, the molecular mechanisms by which it exerts several benefits are starting to emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we examined systematic approaches on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-suppressing capability of damnacanthal in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Damnacanthal exhibits cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> as well as caspase activity induction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also examined several potential target proteins and found that the proapoptotic protein nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory activated gene-1 (NAG-1) is highly induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we have found that damnacanthal also enhances transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ), which controls NAG-1 transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blocking of C/EBPβ by shRNA results in the reduction of NAG-1 expression as well as caspase activity in the presence of damnacanthal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that damnacanthal increases antitumorigenic activity in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and that C/EBPβ plays a role in damnacanthal-induced NAG-1 expression </plain></SENT>
