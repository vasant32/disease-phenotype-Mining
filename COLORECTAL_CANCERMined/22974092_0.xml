<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of serum and plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers, in comparison with clinical and biomedical parameters for response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: One-hundred and six patients with mCRC from three centers, part of a multicenter study, received irinotecan with the Nordic bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and folinic acid schedule (FLIRI) or the de Gramont schedule (Lv5FU2-IRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for CEA, CA19-9, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, TIMP-1, SAA, transthyretin and CRP were taken at baseline and after two, four and eight weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> marker levels at baseline and longitudinally were compared with responses evaluated (CT/MRI) after two and four months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlations to RR, PFS and OS were evaluated with regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant correlation to OS was seen for baseline levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses with clinical parameters, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, CRP, SAA and TIMP-1 provided independent information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The baseline values of CEA, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and TIMP-1 were also significantly correlated to PFS and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> to RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes during treatment, i.e. the slope gave with the exception of CA19-9 for OS less information about outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best correlation to response was seen for CEA, CA19-9 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> with AUC values of 0.78, 0.83 and 0.79, respectively, using a combined model based upon an interaction between the slope and the baseline value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers together with clinical parameters provide prognostic information about survival in patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ability of the individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers to predict treatment response and PFS is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Changes in marker levels during the first two months of treatment are less informative of outcome </plain></SENT>
