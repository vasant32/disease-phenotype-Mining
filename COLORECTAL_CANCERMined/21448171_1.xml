<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 235 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prospectively recruited from five hospitals in the Oslo region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) aspirates were collected at the time of surgery and the presence of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> was determined by two immunological methods; immunomagnetic selection (using an anti-EpCAM antibody) and immunocytochemistry (using a pan-cytokeratin antibody) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations between the presence of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free, disease-specific and overall survival were analysed using univariate and multivariate methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells were detected in 41 (17%) and 28 (12%) of the 235 examined BM samples by immunomagnetic selection and immunocytochemistry, respectively, with only five samples being positive with both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> was associated with adverse outcome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free, disease-specific and overall survival) in univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> was associated with adverse prognosis in this cohort of patients curatively resected for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> detection still holds promise as a biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
