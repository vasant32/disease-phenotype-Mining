<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 37 patients with locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent major urological surgical procedures along with simultaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery between the years of 2005 and 2010 were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 58.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male/Female ratio was 2.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>59% of the patients were primary, and 41% were recurrent cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bladder, ureters, urethra, kidneys and prostate were found as invaded in 19, 9, 5, 2 and 2 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following single or combined procedures were performed; partial (n=11) or total (n=8; 2 combined with urethrocutaneostomy, 6 with ileal-conduit) cystectomy, urethroplasty (n=5), nephroureterectomy (n=2), radical nephrectomy (n=1), partial nephrectomy (n=1), ureteroneocystostomy (n=7), Boari's flap (n=4), transureteroureterostomy (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prolonged drainage was the most common surgical complication (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urethrocutaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> were encountered in 1 and 1 patient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000126'>hydronephrosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated creatinine</z:hpo> were 38% (preoperative 27%; postoperative 11%) and 24% (11% preoperative; 13% postoperative), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in the first month of operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of follow up was 18(6-28) months for surviving 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall survival in 24 cases resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 21(1-42) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since the most important eventual effects of locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are on the kidneys from the urological point of view; the aim of an urologist, as a member of surgical team, should be preserving renal function in addition to helping complete removal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
