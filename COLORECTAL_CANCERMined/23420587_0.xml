<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab has enhanced efficacy in Kras <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, inferior outcomes have been demonstrated concerning the concurrent use of bevacizumab and cetuximab with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need to define the optimal sequence of use of these two agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With regard to the pre-clinical data that increased VEGF expression is associated with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibody, we performed a retrospective analysis on the outcomes of patients who received bevacizumab-containing regimens after cetuximab failure in Kras <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From January 2006 to December 2011, patients who received bevacizumab-containing regimens for mCRC in our institution were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were eligible for further analysis if the following criteria were met: i) Kras <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mCRC; ii) chemotherapy and cetuximab received as immediate prior treatment; iii) chemotherapy and bevacizumab received as the index line of treatment; and iv) imaging conducted for response evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included median progression-free survival (mPFS) and objective response rate (ORR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Targeted adverse events were recorded in accordance with two prospective observational cohort studies; the BRiTE and BEAT studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients who received bevacizumab-containing regimens were reviewed and 18 of them met the criteria for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 12.1 months, the mPFS for the total group of patients was 26.3 weeks (95% CI, 19.5-33.0 weeks) with an ORR of 38.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients (11.1%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that required additional anti-hypertensive drugs and one patient did not survive due to a bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (ATEs), post-operative wound-healing complications (POWHCs) or grade III/IV <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with Kras <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mCRC, bevacizumab-containing regimens following cetuximab failure have modest activity and manageable toxicity </plain></SENT>
