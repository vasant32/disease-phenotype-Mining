<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various 'omics' technologies, including microarrays and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, can be used to identify hundreds of interesting genes, proteins and metabolites, such as differential genes, proteins and metabolites associated with diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying metabolic pathways has become an invaluable aid to understanding the genes and metabolites associated with studying conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the classical methods used to identify pathways fail to accurately consider joint power of interesting gene/metabolite and the key regions impacted by them within metabolic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we propose a powerful analytical method referred to as Subpathway-GM for the identification of metabolic subpathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This provides a more accurate level of pathway analysis by integrating information from genes and metabolites, and their positions and cascade regions within the given pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and one metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> data sets and demonstrated that Subpathway-GM was able to identify disease-relevant subpathways whose corresponding entire pathways might be ignored using classical entire pathway identification methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis indicated that the power of a joint genes/metabolites and subpathway strategy based on their topologies may play a key role in reliably recalling disease-relevant subpathways and finding novel subpathways </plain></SENT>
