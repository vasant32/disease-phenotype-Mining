<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism in a let-7 microRNA complementary site (lcs6) in the KRAS 3' untranslated region (UTR) is associated with an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> and reduced overall survival (OS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153381" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis whether this polymorphism may be associated with clinical outcome in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (KRASwt) mCRC patients treated with cetuximab monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: the presence of KRAS let-7 lcs6 polymorphism was evaluated in 130 mCRC patients who were enrolled in a phase II study of cetuximab monotherapy (IMCL-0144) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from dissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue, KRAS mutation status and polymorphism were assessed using direct sequencing and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS let-7 lcs6 polymorphism was found to be related to object response rate (ORR) in mCRC patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had KRASwt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 12 KRASwt patients harboring at least a variant G allele (TG or GG) had a 42% ORR compared with a 9% ORR in 55 KRASwt patients with let-7 lcs6 TT genotype (P = 0.02, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KRASwt patients with TG/GG genotypes had trend of longer median progression-free survival (3.9 versus 1.3 months) and OS (10.7 versus 6.4 months) compared to those with TT genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: these results are the first to indicate that the KRAS 3'UTR polymorphism may predict for cetuximab responsiveness in KRASwt mCRC patients, which warrants validation in other clinical trials </plain></SENT>
