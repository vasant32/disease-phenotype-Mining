<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors implemented and evaluated the Spokane <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Screening Program-a novel worksite intervention to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening that used a combination of evidence-based strategies recommended by the Guide to Community Preventive Services, as well as additional strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a period of approximately 3 months, participating worksites held one or more physician-led seminars about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening for employees </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors measured attendance at seminars, test kits taken and returned, employee awareness of the program, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates in participating and comparison worksites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that 9% of eligible employees received kits at the worksite, and 4% were screened with these kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Spokane <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Screening Program was a promising pilot test of an innovative worksite screening program that successfully translated evidence-based strategies into practical use in a brief period of time, and it merits a larger study to be able to test its effects more rigorously </plain></SENT>
