<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">Quercetin</z:chebi> (3, 3,' 4', 5, 7 - five-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi>) is one of the main components of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi>, with multifunctions on immune function, anti-oxidation, anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>, anti-inflammatory, and cardiovascular protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> with radiation would increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> radiosensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we conducted in vitro and in vivo studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: The in vitro radio-sensitization activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> was tested in DLD1, HeLa and MCF-7 tumor cell lines by colony formation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in vivo activity was assessed in the DLD-1 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic studies were conducted in several cell lines using Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> can significantly increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> radiosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vitro Sensitizing Enhancement Ratios in DLD1, HeLa and MCF-7 cells were 1.87, 1.65, and 1.74, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean doubling time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts was significantly increased in irradiated mice treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> resulted in prolonged DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanistic studies demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> induced radio-sensitization is through inhibiting the ATM kinase, one of the critical DNA damage response proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo evidence that combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> with radiotherapy can enhance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> radiosensitivity by targeting the ATM-mediated pathway in response to radiation </plain></SENT>
