<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at examining the MSI for the MLH1 and MSH2 genes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, if detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four segments of the colon were sampled in 102 subjects during colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA samples were analyzed for the MSI status according to the Bethesda consensus panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Family history of any type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was present in 44.8% and 9.4% of the individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight percent of individuals were microsatellite stable for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five markers at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> locations, 20% had low MSI status (MSI-L), and 32% had high MSI status (MSI-H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of MSI markers differed significantly from each other (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent positive marker was D17S250 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first study which revealed that MSI is present in endoscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-looking colon of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and, more frequently, in individuals with family histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The detection of very early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is possible by MSI analysis of DNA mismatch repair genes in colon tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study has revealed crucial information for the use of molecular tests in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, such as high frequencies of MSI in endoscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon, which might cause false positivity </plain></SENT>
