<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline variables and clinical outcomes were evaluated for 92 consecutive patients treated with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 92 patients, 32 (35%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the remaining 60 (65%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was successfully achieved in 74 (80%) patients, and 39 of them could receive subsequent chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median survival after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was 273 days in the 39 patients who had undergone successful percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and subsequent chemotherapy, 65 days in 35 patients who had undergone successful percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage but who had not received subsequent chemotherapy and 34 days in the remaining 18 patients who had undergone unsuccessful percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and hepatic hilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235982" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bile duct stricture</z:e> were independently associated with unsuccessful percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor performance status, multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, multiple prior chemotherapy administrations, undifferentiated type histology and high serum CA19-9 level were independently associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A prognostic index calculated based on the number of these six factors was used to classify the patients into a good-risk group (index ≤2) (n = 56) and a poor-risk group (index ≥3) (n = 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival time and 2-month survival rate for the two groups were 163 and 44 days, respectively, and 85.7 and 33.3%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As regards the introduction of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage in patients with obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> due to colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo>, careful patient selection might be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A prognostic model seems to be useful for making decisions as to whether percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is indicated for particular patients </plain></SENT>
