<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks HER2 hetero-dimerization; thus the combination of pertuzumab and cetuximab could possibly overcome cetuximab resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients and methods This single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase I/II study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of pertuzumab and cetuximab in patients with cetuximab-resistant KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were enrolled and received cetuximab in combination with pertuzumab at several dose levels in a 3 + 3 design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A phase II portion was planned, but not initiated due to toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results Six of the thirteen patients (46 %) experienced DLTs, therefore the study was terminated early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or higher DLTs included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> with desquamation and/or acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (n = 6), mucositis or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> (n = 5), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one Grade 5 event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) attributed to underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 13 patients, seven (54 %) were evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The objective response rate was 14 %: one patient had a partial response lasting 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients had stable disease (29 %), and four had progressive disease (57 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median progression free survival was 2.1 months (95 % CI, 1.5-4.9) and median overall survival was 3.7 months (95 % CI, 1.6-7.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion Combination pertuzumab and cetuximab in refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was associated with potential antitumor activity; however, the combination was not tolerable due to overlapping toxicities </plain></SENT>
