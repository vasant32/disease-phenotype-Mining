<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antitumor activity of the combination of S-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> against Lu-99 and PC-9 cancer cell lines was significantly superior to either monotherapy (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, the growth of the Col-1 cells was completely inhibited by the combination of S-1 and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No toxic mortalities and no significant difference in the body weight changes of the animals treated with S-1 combined with the targeted agents or with the mono-therapies were observed; therefore, the treatments appeared to be well-tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our preclinical findings indicate that the combination therapies of S-1 and targeted agents are promising treatment options </plain></SENT>
