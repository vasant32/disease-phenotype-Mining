<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For screening of autoantibodies against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e>-associated antigens, sera from 94 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 54 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant rCCCAP, rHDAC5, rP53, rNMDAR and rNY-CO-16 proteins as coating antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seropositivity among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients to the 5 individual coating antigens varied from 18.1% to 35.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seropositivity to any of the 5 coating antigens was 58.5% and combining this analysis with evaluation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (&gt; or =5 ng/ml) significantly increased the seropositivity to 77.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seropositivity of early-stage (Dukes' Stages A and B) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients to CEA was 21.9%, and seropositivity to any of the 5 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated antigens was 53.7%, and the combination of these 2 measurements resulted in a higher diagnostic capacity (65.9%) than either marker alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results collectively indicated that combined detection of serum autoantibody profiles against our panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e>-associated antigens and the analysis of carcinoembryonic antigen provides a promising diagnostic biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, particularly among early-stage patients </plain></SENT>
