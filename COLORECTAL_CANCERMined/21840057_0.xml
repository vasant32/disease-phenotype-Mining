<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies have indicated that aspirin chemoprevention may be effective in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> within the general population, and aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, and calcium may be effective in preventing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> within those people who have previously undergone polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, and calcium chemoprevention in the context of the fecal occult blood test screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An existing state transition model developed to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening options was modified to incorporate the costs and outcomes associated with chemoprevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative risks of disease progression were incorporated based on the effectiveness of the chemopreventive agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional benefits and harms associated with chemoprevention were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aspirin chemoprevention plus screening within the general population aged 50 to 60 years is estimated to cost £23,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared with screening alone (based on 2008 prices) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For individuals who have undergone polypectomy, calcium is estimated to cost between £8000 and £30,000 per QALY gained depending on the starting and stopping age of the chemoprevention policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on current evidence, calcium has a higher probability than aspirin of providing value for money within this population, although the long-term benefits and harms are subject to considerable uncertainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> chemoprevention is unlikely to be considered to be cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Calcium chemoprevention is likely to be a cost-effective option for individuals who have undergone polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further research is required to assess the long-term benefits and harms of calcium compared with aspirin chemoprevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Chemoprevention appears less economically attractive within the general population </plain></SENT>
