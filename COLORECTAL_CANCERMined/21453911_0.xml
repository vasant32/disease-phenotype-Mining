<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this aim, we developed a multidisciplinary protocol in our hospital for the treatment of patients proposed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: A study was conducted on 437 patients who had surgery performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the period 2005-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data recorded were: demographic data, Hb and iron metabolism (Fe) at the time of diagnosis, Hb on the day of the surgery and on discharge, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, preoperative adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage (TNM), iron treatment, transfusion rate, and complications at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into Group A; Hb &lt; 13 g/dl and/or abnormal Fe metabolism, and Group B; Hb &gt; 13 g/dl and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Fe metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the total, 53.3% were in Group B and were treated with Fe; 73.6% intravenous (IV), and the rest oral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean dose of IV Fe was 867 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean intraindividual difference between the Hb on the day of surgery and at the initial value, increased by 0.6g/dl in Group A, while it decreased by 0.8 g/dl in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean intraindividual difference between the Hb at discharge and the diagnosis decreased by 0.4 g/dl in Group A compared to 2.5 g/dl in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall transfusion rate was 8.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were observed in complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary and early treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> enables patients with a low <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Group A) to be optimised, as well as achieving a lower transfusion rate </plain></SENT>
