<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Paclitaxel (PTX) is a potent chemotherapy for many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> but it suffers from very poor solubility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the TAXOL formulation uses copious amounts of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> Cremophor EL to solubilize the drug for injection, resulting in severe hypersensitivity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Cremophor EL, presented is a way to solubilize PTX by conjugation of a dicarboxylic fatty acid for specific binding to the ubiquitous protein, serum albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conjugation chemistry was simplified to a single step using the activated anhydride form of 3-pentadecylglutaric (PDG) acid, which is reactive to a variety of nucleophiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PDG derivative is less cytotoxic than the parent compound and was found to slowly hydrolyze to PTX (â‰ˆ 5% over 72 h) in serum, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cytosol, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue homogenate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When injected intravenously to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice, [(3) H]-PTX in the TAXOL formulation was cleared rapidly with a half-life of 7 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of the PDG derivative of PTX, the drug is quickly distributed and approximately 20% of the injected dose remained in the vasculature experiencing a 23 h half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These improvements from modifying PTX with the PDG fatty acid present the opportunity for PDG to become a generic modification for the improvement of many therapeutics </plain></SENT>
