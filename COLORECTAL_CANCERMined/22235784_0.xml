<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study assessed the relationship between time, power and ablation size using a novel high-frequency 14.5 GHz microwave applicator in ex vivo human hepatic parenchyma and colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous examination has demonstrated structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but non-viable cells within the ablation zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to further investigate how ablation affects these cells, and to confirm non-viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ablations were performed in ex vivo human hepatic parenchyma and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> for a variety of time (10-180 s) and power (10-50 W) settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examination was performed to assess cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, whilst enzyme histochemistry was used to confirm cellular non-viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the subcellular structural effects of ablation within these fixed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary proteomic analysis was also performed to explore the mechanism of microwave cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increasing time and power settings led to a predictable and reproducible increase in size of ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 50 W and 180 s application, a maximum ablation diameter of 38.8 mm (±1.3) was produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ablations were produced rapidly, and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time and power settings ablations remained spherical (longest:shortest diameter &lt;1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine histological analysis using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (H&amp;E) confirmed well preserved cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> despite ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated marked subcellular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Enzyme histochemistry showed complete absence of viability in ablated tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Large spherical ablation zones can be rapidly and reproducibly achieved in ex vivo human hepatic parenchyma and colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> using a 14.5 GHz microwave generator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite well preserved cellular appearance, ablated tissue is non-viable </plain></SENT>
