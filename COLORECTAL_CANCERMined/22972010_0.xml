<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare perioperative outcomes of simultaneous colorectal/liver resection (SCLR) with isolated resections utilizing a national clinical database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NSQIP data from 2005 to 2009 were examined to construct risk-adjusted generalized linear models and to calculate group-specific predicted estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were used to compare 30-day perioperative outcomes among patients undergoing SCLR with colorectal (CR) and liver resections (LR) only in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 3,983 patients were identified, who underwent SCLR (192), LR (1,857), or CR (1,934) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rectal resection was performed in 45 (23.4 %) SCLR patients and 269 (13.9 %) CR patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major hepatectomy was performed in 69 (35.9 %) SCLR patients and 774 (41.7 %) LR patients (p = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median adjusted operation time (SCLR: 273 min, 95 % CI: 253-295; CR: 172, CI: 168-177; LR: 222, CI: 217-228; p &lt; 0.001) and median adjusted length of hospital stay (SCLR: 9.5 days, CI: 8.8-10.4; CR: 8.1, CI: 7.9-8.3; LR: 6.4, CI: 6.3-6.6; p &lt; 0.001) were longer for SCLR compared to CR and LR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusted predicted risks for at least one postoperative complication were higher in SCLR (36.3 %) than in CR (26.6 %) and LR (19.8 %) (p &lt; 0.003), mostly due to infectious/cardiopulmonary issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In SCLR patients, the risk of 30-day adverse outcomes is higher, and median operation time as well as length of hospital stay is longer compared to CR and LR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the expected combined morbidities of staged procedures though likely favor SCLR in carefully selected patients undergoing even complex hepatic and colorectal resections and should be considered </plain></SENT>
