<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: To investigate the participation rates, positivity rates, and follow-up rates from 2004 to 2008 in an organized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening program using a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population was men and women aged 50 years or older who were invited to participate in the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Screening Program for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We collected the FOBT results and follow-up information for the FOBT positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participation rates increased steadily each year from 10.5% in 2004 to 21.1% in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 2004 and 2008, FOBT positivity rates declined from 8.0% to 6.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the FOBT-positives, 61.3% of participants underwent either colonoscopy or double contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema (DCBE) in 2004, and this rate decreased to 38.6% in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, health insurance type, and screening history were associated with adherence to follow-up test after a positive FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard to follow-up tests, colonoscopy rates increased from 17.9% in 2004 to 27.6% in 2008, while DCBE decreased from 43.4% in 2004 to 11.0% in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was significantly more likely to be chosen as a follow-up test by men, participants aged 50-59 years, and National Health Insurance beneficiaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that targeting participants for follow-up, based on age and previous screening history, could be a good way to improve the follow-up rate </plain></SENT>
