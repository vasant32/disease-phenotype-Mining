<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiation-induced bystander response was investigated in human MCF-7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells and human HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells employing medium-transfer experiments and micronuclei (MN) induction as an end-point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) from cells exposed to α-particle or γ-radiation was filtered and transferred to unirradiated cells 2 h following irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCF-7 cells were irradiated with 0.5 Gy α-particles, while HCT116 p53(+/+) and HCT116 p53(-/-) cells were irradiated with 0.5 Gy γ-radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bystander MCF-7 cells, recipient of ICCM from 0.5 Gy α-particle irradiated MCF-7 cells grown in high <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> conditions showed a modest but significant increase in MN, while MCF-7 cells receiving ICCM with low <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels did not show any bystander effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Added <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (100 ng/ml) led to a bystander effectin HCT116 p53(-/-) cells recipient of ICCM from 0.5 Gy γ-irradiated HCT116 p53(+/+) cells, but had no effect when the ICCM was from γ-irradiated HCT116 P53(-/-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicate that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels in the medium play a role in the RIBE and that there may be an interaction between the role of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and the p53 status of the irradiated cells </plain></SENT>
