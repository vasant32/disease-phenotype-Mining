<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Newer systemic therapies have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, yet such therapies are costly and have side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about their non-evidence-based use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using commercial insurance claims from UnitedHealthcare, and identified incident cases of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (mCC) from July 2007 through April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the use of three regimens with recommendations against their use in the National Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Network Guidelines, a commonly used standard of care: 1) bevacizumab beyond progression; 2) single agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> as a salvage therapy after failure on a fluoropyridimidine-containing regimen; 3) panitumumab or cetuximab after progression on a prior epidermal growth factor receptor antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed sensitivity analyses of key assumptions regarding cohort selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs from a payer perspective were estimated using the average sales price for the entire duration and based on the number of claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 7642 patients with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> were identified, of which 1041 (14%) had mCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those, 139 (13%) potentially received at least one of the three unsupported off-label (UOL) therapies; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> was administered to 121 patients and 49 (40%) likely received it outside of clinical guidelines, at an estimated cost of $718,000 for 218 claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients received panitumumab and six patients (16%) received it after being on cetuximab at least two months, at an estimated cost of $69,500 for 19 claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab was administered to 884 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of those, 90 (10%) patients received it outside of clinical guidelines, at an estimated costs of $1.34 million for 636 claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large privately insured mCC cohort, a substantial number of patients potentially received UOL treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The economic costs and treatment toxicities of these therapies warrant increased efforts to stem their use in settings lacking sufficient scientific evidence </plain></SENT>
