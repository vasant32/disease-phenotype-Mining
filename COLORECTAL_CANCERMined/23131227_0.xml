<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to radiologically evaluate the mechanical defects at stoma sites in patients who had previously undergone a permanent colostomy with or without mesh at the index operation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A study was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (n=41) having an end colostomy between 2002 and 2010, with or without Prolene(®) mesh plication, with blinded evaluation of the annual follow-up staging computed tomography (CT) for stomal characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of parastomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo>, volume, dimensions, grade of the parastomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defect</z:hpo> size were measured by two independent radiologists, and compared with demographic and operative variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In those patients with radiological evidence of a parastomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo>, Prolene(®) mesh plication significantly reduced the incidence of bowel containing parastomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> at one year following the procedure (p&lt;0.05) and also reduced the diameter of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defect</z:hpo> (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic mesh placement at the time of the index procedure reduces the diameter of abdominal wall aperture and the incidence of parastomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> containing bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future studies should use both objective radiological as well as clinical endpoints when assessing parastomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> development with and without prophylactic mesh </plain></SENT>
