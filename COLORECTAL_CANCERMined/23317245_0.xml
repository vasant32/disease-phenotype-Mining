<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We included 289 Chinese patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, who had received 5-FU/oxalipatin chemotherapy as first-line treatment from January 2005 to January 2007 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping for XRCC1 Arg399Gln and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln polymorphisms was based upon duplex polymerase-chain-reaction with the PCR-RFLP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study, we found the XRCC1 399 Gln/Gln genotype to confer significantly higher rates of response to chemotherapy when compared to the Arg/Arg genotype [OR (95% CI)=2.56(1.57-2.55)]. patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> 751 Gln/Gln genotype had significantly higher rates of response to chemotherapy [OR (95% CI)=1.54(0.87-2.65)] and those with the XRCC1 399 Gln/Gln genotype had a longer average survival time and significantly lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than did those with the Arg/Arg genotype [HR (95% CI)=0.66(0.36-0.95)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, those carrying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> 751Gln/Gln genotype had 0.51-fold the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> 751Lys/Lys [HR (95% CI)=0.51(0.33-0.94)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is suggested that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln polymorphisms should be routinely assessed to determine colorectal patients who are more likely to benefit from 5-FU/oxalipatin chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
