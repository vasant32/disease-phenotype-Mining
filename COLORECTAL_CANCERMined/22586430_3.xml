<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence in the United States is greater than 200 cases per 100,000, with the total number of IBD patients between 1 and 1.5 million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD may affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the gastrointestinal tract, from mouth to anus, but most commonly involves the distal part of the small intestine or ileum, and colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UC results in colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> that can affect the rectum only, or can progress proximally to involve part of or the entire colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A serious long-term complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A genetic basis for IBD had long been recognized based on the increased familial risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, significant discordance for CD in twins, and a much less robust phenotypic concordance for UC, suggested additional factors play a role in disease pathogenesis, including environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the past several years, progress in understanding the molecular basis of IBD has accelerated, beginning with the generation of animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and progressing to the identification of specific genetic markers from candidate gene, gene linkage, and genome-wide association analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies have also resulted in the recognition of the importance of environmental factors, particularly the crucial role of the gut microbiota in CD and UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altered immune responses to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal flora are key factors in IBD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this research topic, the genetic basis of IBD, the genetic and cellular alterations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and the emerging role of the intestinal microbiota and other environmental factors will be reviewed </plain></SENT>
