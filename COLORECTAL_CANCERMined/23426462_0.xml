<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS:: Epidemiological data have demonstrated that Hispanics have a lower incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) compared with other major race/ethnicity groups in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data regarding the relative prevalence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (CRAs) in Hispanic versus non-Hispanic populations are currently sparse and inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: We conducted a retrospective review of colonoscopy patients (n=1656) at a single tertiary-care community hospital from 2007 to 2011, to evaluate the association of self-reported race/ethnicity status with CRA prevalence and characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors were also included in multivariate regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Overall, the CRA prevalence was lower in Hispanic subjects than non-Hispanic subjects (14.8% vs. 22.5%) and this difference was statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.96; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, no difference in CRA prevalence was observed between non-Hispanic white and black subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analyses by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> location revealed more pronounced reduction in proximal CRA prevalence for Hispanics versus non-Hispanics (5.3% vs. 13.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.70; P&lt;0.001), whereas CRA prevalence in distal colon, rectum or multiple locations did not differ significantly between race/ethnicity groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Our data showed a marked distinction in CRA prevalence, particularly proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, between Hispanics and non-Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional multicenter studies are needed to confirm these findings, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and clarify the implications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and other preventive and/or therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
