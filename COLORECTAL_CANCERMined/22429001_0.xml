<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated dietary intakes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a large case-control study conducted in metropolitan Detroit, Michigan (N = 2664) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> intake, as assessed by a food frequency questionnaire, were confined to risk of proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses showed that the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> on risk of proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> were significant only when fruit intake or the Healthy Eating Index score was high, or when tea intake was low, with odds ratios (OR) for the highest vs. the lowest quartile of 0.49, 0.44, and 0.51, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> intake had no protective effects when tea intake was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, increased intake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> was associated with increased risk of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> when total fruit intake was low (OR for the highest vs. the lowest quartile = 1.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> can have disparate effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk depending on whether dietary intakes of fruit or tea are high, and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> had protective effects only on proximal, not distal, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
