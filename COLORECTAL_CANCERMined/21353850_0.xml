<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A screening colonoscopy is recommended in first-degree relatives (FDRs) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients; few prospective, controlled studies have evaluated colorectal findings in a population-based screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>) in this increased-risk population, to compare it with that of average-risk individuals, and to identify features that might allow risk stratification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> among FDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Population-based screening program in Trentino, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: FDRs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients between 45 and 75 years of age with no history of hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> syndromes or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONTROLS: Average-risk individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasia</z:hpo> was found in 33.4% of 1252 FDRs and in 30.3% of 765 controls; advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was found in 11.3% of FDRs and in 6.3% of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) from the multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, cecal intubation rates, and colon cleansing showed an increased risk of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (OR 2.41; 95% CI, 1.69-3.43; P &lt; .0001) in FDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age older than 56 years (OR 1.83; 95% CI, 1.15-2.99; P = .013) and male sex (OR 2.17; 95% CI, 1.39-3.10; P &lt; .001) are independent predictors of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Italian subjects living in the same geographic area; of 4301 FDRs, 2521 were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> supports the current recommendation for colonoscopic screening in this group; age and sex may assist in risk stratification of these individuals </plain></SENT>
