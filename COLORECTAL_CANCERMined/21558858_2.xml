<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to quantify the association between dietary patterns and colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 151 rectum and 102 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cases selected among surgical patients at the Portuguese <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Institute, and 879 community controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary patterns were defined with principal components and cluster analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, education, total energy intake, and physical activity-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three dietary patterns were identified: (i) PI: 'healthy,' high consumption of dairy products, wholegrain cereals, vegetables/salads, legumes, fruits and vegetable soup, and low intake of wine; (ii) PII: 'low consumption of milk and foods containing dietary fiber,' low intake of dairy products, vegetables/salads, legumes, and fruits; and (iii) PIII: 'western,' high consumption of red/processed meat, refined cereals, sugar and sweets, potatoes, alcoholic beverages, and low intake of wholegrain cereals and vegetable soup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with PI, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was higher among subjects with PII (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.04-4.14) and PIII (OR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.19-4.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The OR estimates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancer</z:e> were 3.12 (95% CI: 1.74-5.61) and 1.41 (95% CI: 0.75-2.63), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm the higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among subjects with 'western' diets and 'low consumption of milk and foods containing foods containing dietary fiber' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At a local level, these results support public health messages based on the accumulated evidence on the relationship between individual food items/groups and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
