<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May 2003 and June 2010, 76 patients were found eligible for this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, presenting symptoms, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> presentation, family history, presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, histologic features, localization and stage of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, treatment outcomes, time and site of recurrence, sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and survival outcomes were recorded from the patient files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (55.3% male) with a median age of 23 years were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated in 2 groups as follows: child-adolescent (0 to 19 y, n=20) and young adult (20 to 25 y, n=56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sex and symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>) were significantly differed between the groups and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> presentation was close to statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival significantly increased in patients undergoing curative surgery (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other parameters affecting the survival was stage of disease (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response to palliative chemotherapy in metastatic patients (P=0.042) and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy had a statistically significant survival advantage (P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> should not be excluded solely on the basis of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> features in young-adult patients are more similar to adults compared with that of child-adolescent patients according to the symptoms and presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in this age group, curative surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and palliative chemotherapy provide survival advantage </plain></SENT>
