<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 OTUs belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella, Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut microbiota of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and 5 OTUs belonging to the genus Roseburia and other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae were less abundant </plain></SENT>
