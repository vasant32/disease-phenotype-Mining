<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The addition of irinotecan to infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5 fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin significantly improves the response rate and survival compared with 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin alone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> with irinoteacan was reported to yield comparable results in phase II studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY: Patients older than 75 years, Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group â‰¤0 to 3, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513041" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measurable disease</z:e>, no previous treatment for advanced disease, previous adjuvant chemotherapy &gt;6 months, and adequate hepatic, renal, and hematological function were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment protocol included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1000 mg/m twice daily given for 14 days (days 1 to 14) and irinotecan (100 mg/m) given on days 1 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was repeated on day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were assessable for response and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average age was 64 years, male/female ratio 20/10 </plain></SENT>
