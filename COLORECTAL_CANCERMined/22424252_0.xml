<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many trials have tested different strategies to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few describe whether participants are representative of the population from which they are recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine risk factors related to nonparticipation among patients enrolled in an integrated health plan and not up to date for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing, in a trial to increase screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 2008 and October 2009, a total of 15,000 adults aged 50-74 years from 21 clinics in Washington State who were due for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were contacted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonparticipants were defined as English-speaking patients who did not engage in the call or refused participation while still potentially eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the relative risk of nonparticipation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were completed between October 2010 and June 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who were nonwhite, had less education, used tobacco, had less continuity of care, and had lower rates of preventive care and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening were more likely to be nonparticipants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients reporting never having received any type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing or screening were also more likely not to participate (62% of nonparticipants vs 46% of participants; adjusted RR=1.58, 95% CI=1.47, 1.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reasons for refusal included costs, risks of procedures, and not wanting their medical records reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients eligible for but not participating in the trial were more likely to be from minority socioeconomic and racial groups and had behaviors that can negatively affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional efforts are needed to recruit patients who need <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening the most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT 00697047 </plain></SENT>
