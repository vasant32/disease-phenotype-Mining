<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic examinations of resected nontumoral liver tissue revealed chemotherapy-associated liver injuries, which was recognized to impair the function of the remnant liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) plasma clearance helps to assess chemotherapy-induced liver damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of 101 liver resections performed between 2006 and 2008 for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were analyzed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had liver resection without preoperative treatment, whereas 83 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ICG clearance was assessed by pulse densitometry before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparison of ICG retention clearances demonstrated that patients pretreated with systemic chemotherapy had a significantly lower plasma disappearance rate (ICG-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e>; 19.3 ± 5.9 vs. 23.1 ± 3.8%/min; P = 0.002) and a significantly elevated ICG retention rate at 15 min (7.9 ± 6.6 vs. 3.8 ± 1.9%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of subjects with an abnormal ICG-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> (≤18%/min) was significantly higher in the pretreated group (48.2% vs. 5.6%; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with an ICG-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDR</z:e> of ≤18 had a prolonged postoperative hospital stay and experienced four times more complications in their postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICG clearance helps to identify patients with impaired liver function after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> in the estimation of the postoperative risk of morbidity after liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
