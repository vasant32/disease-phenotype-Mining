<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative serum carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) level in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included 125 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients aged from 14 to 87 years, surgically treated between January 2001 and December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative serum CEA was measured by chemiluminescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: within the patients, 57 were males and 68 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> classified Dukes A in 2 patients, B in 24 patients, C in 53 patients and Dukes D in 46 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up period was 24 months (range, 4 - 72 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relapse-free survival was significantly higher in patients with CEA &lt; 5 ng/ml compared to CEA ³ 5 ng/ml, (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed significant differences in relapse-free survival between patients with CEA &lt; 5 ng/ml and those with CEA ³ 5 ng/ml among patients classified as Dukes stage B (p=0.007) and C (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in relapse-free survival among those classified as Dukes stage D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative serum CEA level was a significant independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (hazard ratio: 6.49, 95% CI, 3.09 to 13.62, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preoperative serum CEA is a reliable predictor factor for recurrence in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CEA might be used in staging system and will be useful for therapeutic orientation in patients undergoing curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
