<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors of this report evaluated venous and lymphatic invasion as potential prognostic indicators in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> focusing on lymph node-negative patients and compared routine and review pathology diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 381 tumors from randomly selected patients were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of vascular invasion was related to disease-free and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For multivariable analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lymphatic invasion and venous invasion were observed in 126 patients (33%) and 87 patients (23%), respectively, and were associated significantly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> classification, lymph node status, American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>/International Union Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (AJCC/UICC) disease stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, pattern of invasion, and extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The detection of vascular invasion was related to the number of examined tissue blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous and lymphatic invasion proved to be significant prognostic variables in univariable and multivariable analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extramural vascular involvement was of particular significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the analysis was restricted to patients with (AJCC/UICC) stage II disease, venous invasion, but not lymphatic invasion, was identified as an independent prognostic variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Review pathology diagnoses differed significantly from routine diagnoses with respect to prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Venous and lymphatic invasion proved to be significant prognostic variables in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The detection of vascular invasion and, consequently, risk stratification of affected patients were related to the quality of pathology workup, ie, the number of examined tissue blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Observed differences between review and routine pathology diagnoses illustrated the need for high-quality pathology reporting and also for standardized quality control </plain></SENT>
