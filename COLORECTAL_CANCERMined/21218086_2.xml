<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Differences in protein expression between primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with LNM (LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and without LNM (non-LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were assessed using <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> esterification stable isotope labeling coupled with 2D liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship to clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of candidate biomarkers was examined using an independent sample set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-three proteins were found to be differentially expressed by at least 2.5-fold in two types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S100A4 was significantly upregulated in LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with non-LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which was confirmed by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further immunohistochemistry on another 112 CRC cases showed that overexpression of S100A4 frequently existed in LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with non-LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of S100A4 was significantly associated with LNM (P&lt;0.001), advanced TNM stage (P&lt;0.001), increased 5-year recurrence rate (P&lt;0.001) and decreased 5-year overall survival rate (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that S100A4 expression was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: S100A4 might serve as a powerful biomarker for LNM and a prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
