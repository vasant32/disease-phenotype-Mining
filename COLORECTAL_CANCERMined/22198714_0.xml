<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To compare the expected and perceived burden of both in a randomised trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: 8844 Dutch citizens aged 50-74 years were randomly invited for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening with colonoscopy (n=5924) or CT-colonography (n=2920) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was performed after full colon lavage, or CT-colonography after limited bowel preparation (non-cathartic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> invitees were asked to complete the expected burden questionnaire before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were invited to complete the perceived burden questionnaire 14 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean scores were calculated on 5-point scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expected burden: 2111 (36%) colonoscopy and 1199 (41%) CT-colonography invitees completed the expected burden questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy invitees expected the bowel preparation and screening procedure to be more burdensome than CT-colonography invitees: mean scores 3.0±1.1 vs 2.3±0.9 (p&lt;0.001) and 3.1±1.1 vs 2.2±0.9 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perceived burden: 1009/1276 (79%) colonoscopy and 801/982 (82%) CT-colonography participants completed the perceived burden questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The full screening procedure was reported as more burdensome in CT-colonography than in colonoscopy: 1.8±0.9 vs 2.0±0.9 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Drinking the bowel preparation resulted in a higher burden score in colonoscopy (3.0±1.3 vs 1.7±1.0, p&lt;0.001) while related bowel movements were scored more burdensome in CT-colonography (2.0±1.0 vs 2.2±1.1, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most participants would probably or definitely take part in a next screening round: 96% for colonoscopy and 93% for CT-colonography (p=0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programme, colonoscopy invitees expected the screening procedure and bowel preparation to be more burdensome than CT-colonography invitees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In participants, CT-colonography was scored as more burdensome than colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Intended participation in a next screening round was comparable </plain></SENT>
