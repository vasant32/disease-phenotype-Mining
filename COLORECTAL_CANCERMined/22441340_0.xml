<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: : Although research shows that African Americans and Hispanics frequently receive less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (CRCS) than whites, few studies have focused on CRCS among Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to compare CRCS between Asians and whites and to evaluate for clinical predictors of CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : From the 2007 California Health Interview Survey, we identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Asian and white respondents who were eligible for CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was performed to evaluate for differences in CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used stratified and interaction analyses to examine whether associations between race and CRCS were modified by insurance status, birthplace, or language skills, while controlling for other confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Baseline characteristics were similar between Asians and whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 58% of Asians and 66% of whites reported undergoing up-to-date CRCS (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, visiting a physician more than 5 times produced the highest odds of being up-to-date with screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared with whites, Asians had decreased odds of being up-to-date with screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses showed that this disparity existed mainly in the insured, but not in the uninsured, and it was not modified by place of birth or English language proficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : Despite its ability to reduce mortality, CRCS is suboptimal in our US population-based cohort of Asians when compared with whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A contributing factor to this problem for the Chinese and Koreans may be a lack of awareness regarding CRCS, whereas the source of the problem in the Vietnamese seems to be related to healthcare access </plain></SENT>
