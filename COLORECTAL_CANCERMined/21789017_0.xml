<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of palonosetron followed by a single dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (BC) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) receiving moderate emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Chemotherapy-naive BC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were given MEC as adjuvant or first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Palonosetron (0.25 mg IV) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (8 mg IV) were administered before chemotherapy on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was complete response (CR; no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and no use of rescue medication) during the overall study period (days 1-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> response was evaluated during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (day 1) and delayed (days 2-5) phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were enrolled (median age 61 years, 56 females; BC = 40, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CR was observed in 46 of 68 patients (67.6%), while CR during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and delayed phases was 75.0% in each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> regimen was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single administration of palonosetron and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> on day 1 in BC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients adequately controls CINV during the entire period of emetic risk </plain></SENT>
