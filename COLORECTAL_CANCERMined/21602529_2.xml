<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies have suggested a chemopreventive effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This effect has not been reported in IBD patients using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> use and the risk of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (AN), including high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, in a large cohort of patients with IBD in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PALGA, the nationwide network and registry of histo- and cytopathology in The Netherlands was linked to an anonymised computerised database of a Dutch health insurance company to identify patients with IBD with or without AN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmaceutical data, including type and duration of medication use, were collected between January 2001 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to calculate risk of AN in patients with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2578 patients with IBD were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 973 patients (38%) used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>, 314 (12%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, 456 (18%) both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> and 835 (32%) none of these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (1%) developed AN during 16,289 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 11 patients (39%) had used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>, two (7%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> and one (4%) both drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">Thiopurine</z:chebi> use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of developing AN (adjusted HR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> therapy also had a protective effect on developing AN, but this was not statistically significant (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">Thiopurine</z:chebi> use protects IBD patients against the development of AN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> appeared to be less pronounced </plain></SENT>
