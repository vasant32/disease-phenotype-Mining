<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled in this study and were administrated FOLFIRI (irinotecan; 150 mg/m(2)) as first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients accepted the evaluation of UGT1A1 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with UGT1A1 28 homozygosity, the starting dose was reduced (100 mg/m(2)) according to the Food and Drug Administration recommendation and our previous phase I study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 22 months, complete response was achieved in 1.9%, partial response in 38.5 %, stable disease in 51.9% and progressive disease in 3.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 40.4%, the disease control rate was 92.3% and the median overall survival time was 22.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major toxicity was grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 44.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no definite relation between UGT1A1 28, 6 polymorphisms and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, homozygosity for UGT1A1 28 or UGT1A1 6 and double heterozygosity for both UGT1A1 28 and UGT1A1 6 were significantly associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FOLFIRI is effective and tolerable for Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity for UGT1A1 28 or 6 and heterozygosity for both UGT1A1 28 and 6 are associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
