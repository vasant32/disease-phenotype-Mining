<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these miRNAs, miR-22 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor has been shown to play a crucial role in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its association with the clinicopathological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has yet to be addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the expression of miR-22 between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent mucosa using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of miR-22 expression with clinicopathological characters was analyzed by appropriate statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the associations of miR-22 expression with survival of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the relative expression levels of miR-22 were significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues than those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent mucosa, and low expression of miR-22 correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with reduced miR-22 had a poor overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the multivariate analysis showed that reduced expression of miR-22 was an independent predictor of overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate the potential of miR-22 as a novel prognostic biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
