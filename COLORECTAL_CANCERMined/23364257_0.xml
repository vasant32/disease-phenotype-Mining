<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that chemotherapy and radiotherapy suppress <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> through inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells are not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we observed that the expression level of BNIP3 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells was significantly increased by treatment with therapeutic agents and radiation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BNIP3 protein level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues from patients who received preoperative concurrent chemotherapy was significantly higher than in those who received surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation significantly decreased the DNMT1 expression level and enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both expression level and activity of DNMT1 were inversely correlated with the expression level of BNIP3 in colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with increased BNIP3 expression, chemotherapeutic agents and radiation induced colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, we conclude that chemotherapy and radiotherapy inhibit DNMT1 expression to upregulate BNIP3 expression to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And, BNIP3 may play a role in the caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways, mainly during treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
