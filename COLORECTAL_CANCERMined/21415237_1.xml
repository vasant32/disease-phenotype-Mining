<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU)-containing chemotherapy regimens on overall survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A meta-analysis, based on individual patient data from six randomised non-inferiority trials, was carried out at the request of regulatory authorities to compare the effects of single-agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy versus matched 5-FU-based regimens in terms of overall survival in patients with stage III colon, metastatic colorectal or advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from a total of 6171 patients with stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (n = 1987), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (n = 3868) or advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (n = 316) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 3097 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy and 3074 patients with 5-FU-containing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted hazard ratio for overall survival for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy versus 5-FU-containing chemotherapy was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.89-1.00; P = 0.0489) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> is at least equivalent to i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5-FU in terms of overall survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> and 5-FU can be used interchangeably in these patient populations </plain></SENT>
