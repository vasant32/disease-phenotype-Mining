<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patients were treated with irinotecan (120 mg/m(2)), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (100 mg/m(2)), and floxuridine (500 mg/m(2)) via tumorsupplying arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous leucovorin (200 mg/day) and floxuridine (300 mg/m(2)/day) were given on days 1-3 after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic courses were repeated every 4-8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> responses, overall survival, and the time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 204 cumulative cycles of chemotherapy were performed for 31 patients (median 7.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>19 patients achieved a partial response; in 10 patients the disease stabilized, and in 2 patients the disease progressed, producing an overall response rate of 61.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 24.8 months, and the median time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> was 10.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, elevation of serum transaminases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> were 6.5, 9.7, 3.2, 19.4, and 90.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This triplecombination chemotherapy as firstline treatment through HAI was well tolerated and effective in patients with unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
