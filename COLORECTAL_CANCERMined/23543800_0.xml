<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Keeping continuity with our previous study that revealed direct correlations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and enhanced CacyBP protein levels, here we attempt to improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved within this enigmatic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of CacyBP (CacyBP-OE) in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell and its knock down (CacyBP-KD) in the metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells revealed (through phenotypic studies) the positive impact of the protein on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, two individual 4-plex iTRAQ based comparative proteomics experiments were carried out on the CacyBP-OE and CacyBP-KD cells, each with two biological replicates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mining of proteomics data identified total 279 (63.80% up-regulated and 36.20% down-regulated) proteins to be significantly altered in expression level for the OE set and in the KD set, this number was 328 (48.78% up-regulated and 51.22% down-regulated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional implications of these significantly regulated proteins were related to metastatic phenotypes such as cell migration, invasion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene ontology analysis identified integrin signaling as the topmost network regulated within CacyBP-OE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further detection of caveolar mediated endocytosis in the top hit list correlated this phenomenon with the dissociation of integrins from the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> complex which are known to provide the traction force for cell movement when transported back to the leading edge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding was further supported by the data obtained from CacyBP-KD dataset showing down-regulation of proteins necessary for integrin endocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, intracellular calcium levels (known to influence integrin mediated cell migration) were found to be lowered in CacyBP-KD cells indicating decreased cell motility and vice versa for the CacyBP-OE cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Actin nucleation by ARP-WASP complex, known to promote cell migration, was also identified as one of the top regulated pathways in CacyBP-OE cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In short, this study presents CacyBP as a promising candidate biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and also sheds light on the underlying molecular mechanism by which CacyBP promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
