<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A polymorphism G&gt;C (rs2910164) is located in the stem region opposite to the mature miR-146a sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, we investigated whether rs2910164 is associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped the rs2910164 polymorphism using TaqMan method and evaluated the association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in a case-control study, including 1,147 CRC patients and 1,203 cancer-free controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to assess the genetic effects on the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, we found that rs2910164 was significantly associated with the reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk [GC/CC versus GG: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.66-0.93] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the stratification analysis, this decreased risk was also pronounced among non-smokers (0.75, 0.61-0.93), non-drinkers (0.77, 0.63-0.94), and no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (0.79, 0.65-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GC/CC genotypes were associated with reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility in intermediate differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (0.75, 0.62-0.90), and similar effect was observed in patients with the advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (Dukes C and D) (0.76, 0.61-0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-146a rs2910164 may contribute to the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further larger population-based prospective and functional studies are needed to validate our findings </plain></SENT>
