<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional, purposive sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Urban community in Brooklyn, NY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE: A purpose-derived, convenience sample of 245 European American, African American, and immigrant Jamaican men and women (aged 45-70 years) living in Brooklyn, NY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants provided demographics and completed a comprehensive measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening embarrassment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Participant gender and ethnicity, physician gender, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening embarrassment regarding feces or the rectum and unwanted physical intimacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: As predicted, men and women both reported reduced fecal and rectal embarrassment and intimacy concern regarding same-gender physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, Jamaicans reported greater embarrassment regarding feces or the rectum compared to European Americans and African Americans; however, in contrast to expectations, women reported less embarrassment than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interactions indicated that rectal and fecal embarrassment was particularly high among Jamaican men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Men and women have a preference for same-gender physicians, and embarrassment regarding feces and the rectum shows the most consistent ethnic and gender variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Discussing embarrassment and its causes, as well as providing an opportunity to choose a same-gender physician, may be promising strategies to reduce or manage embarrassment and increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening attendance </plain></SENT>
