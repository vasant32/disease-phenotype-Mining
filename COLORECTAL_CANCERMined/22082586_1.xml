<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recently identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> suppressor 15-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyses <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> turnover and is downregulated at a very early stage in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>; however, the mechanism responsible remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As Wnt/β-catenin signalling is also deregulated early in colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, a study was undertaken to determine whether β-catenin represses 15-PGDH expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of modulating Wnt/β-catenin signalling (using β-catenin siRNA, mutant TCF4, Wnt3A or GSK3 inhibition) on 15-PGDH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, protein expression and promoter activity was determined in colorectal cell lines by immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and reporter assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of β-catenin deletion in vivo was addressed by 15-PGDH immunostaining of β-catenin(-/lox)-villin-creERT2 mouse tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>15-PGDH promoter occupancy was determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) levels by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study shows for the first time that β-catenin knockdown upregulates 15-PGDH in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells without affecting COX-2 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dominant negative mutant form of TCF4 (dnTCF4), unable to bind β-catenin, also upregulated 15-PGDH; conversely, increasing β-catenin activity using Wnt3A or GSK3 inhibition downregulated 15-PGDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, inducible β-catenin deletion in vivo also upregulated intestinal epithelial 15-PGDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>15-PGDH regulation occurred at the protein, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and promoter activity levels and chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated β-catenin/TCF4 binding to the 15-PGDH promoter. β-catenin knockdown decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) levels, and this was significantly rescued by 15-PGDH siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest a novel role for β-catenin in promoting colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> through very early 15-PGDH suppression leading to increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) levels, possibly even before COX-2 upregulation </plain></SENT>
