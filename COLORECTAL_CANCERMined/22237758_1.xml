<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 450 laparoscopic colorectal resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> performed at a single center between 1994 and 2008 and included in a prospectively maintained database were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who required conversion to open surgery (CONV) were matched 1:2 with laparoscopically completed cases (LAP) and 1:5 with open surgery cases (OPEN) for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) score, year of surgery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fisher's exact, chi-square, and Wilcoxon tests were used as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves were compared to analyze survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study, 31 CONV cases were independently compared with 62 LAP and 155 OPEN cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the LAP and OPEN patients, the CONV patients were characterized by a numerically higher rate of preoperative comorbidity (61.3% vs LAP, 51.6; P = 0.4 and OPEN, 48.4%; P = 0.2), male gender (77.4% vs LAP, 59.7%; P = 0.09 and OPEN, 58.1%; P = 0.05), and a significantly higher mean body mass index (29.6 vs LAP, 26.8; P = 0.012 and OPEN, 28.8; P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, location, and chemotherapy and radiotherapy rates were comparable among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up period of 4.1, 4.2, and 4.6 years, the 5-year disease-free survival rate was significantly lower for the CONV patients (40.2%) than for the LAP (70.7%, P = 0.01) or the OPEN (63.3%, P = 0.04) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival rates were similar among the CONV (94.4%), LAP (86.1%, P = 0.36), and OPEN (84.9%, P = 0.14) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Conversion to open surgery does not affect oncologic outcomes, although CONV patients have increased comorbidity rates affecting long-term mortality </plain></SENT>
