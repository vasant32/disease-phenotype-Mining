<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan is a major drug for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and a promising agent for other applications like <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its clinical activity is currently limited by both intrinsic (natural) and acquired drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the underlying resistance mechanisms is needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to irinotecan or its active metabolite SN-38 is accompanied by EGFR activation, either by stimulation of EGFR autophosphorylation or by Src-mediated phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, combinations of irinotecan and EGFR inhibitors have been associated with supra-additive activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We now show that acquired resistance to SN-38 is accompanied by increased expression of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and Src proteins in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell models as well as by Src activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One SN-38 resistant model (HT-29) showed increased sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi>, an EGFR inhibitor, and afatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, while the other SN-38 resistant model (HCT-116) showed increased resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> but unchanged or increased sensitivity to afatinib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, both models showed increased or unaltered resistance to the Src inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, tyrosine kinase upregulation is not necessarily accompanied by increased sensitivity to targeted agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings demonstrate that prolonged exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50276">topoisomerase I inhibitors</z:chebi> is accompanied by upregulation of different signal transduction pathways which can alter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sensitivity to molecular targeted agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that chemotherapy exposure may lead to creation of novel targets which could be exploited therapeutically </plain></SENT>
