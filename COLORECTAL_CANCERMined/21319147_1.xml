<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effective interventions to increase screening that can be implemented broadly are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A controlled trial was conducted to evaluate a patient-level and practice-level intervention to increase the use of recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests among health plan members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient-level intervention was a patient decision aid and included stage-targeted brochures that were mailed to health plan members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention practices received academic detailing to prepare practices to facilitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing once patients were activated by the decision aid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used patient surveys and claims data to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 443 active participants, 75.8% were ages 52 to 59 years, 80.9% were white, 62.1% were women, and 46.4% had college degrees or greater education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 380 active participants with known screening status at 12 months based on survey results, 39% in the intervention group reported receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening compared with 32.2% in the usual care group (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval; [CI], 0.88-2.05; P = .17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for baseline differences and accounting for clustering, the effect was somewhat larger (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.98-2.73; P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Claims analysis produced similar effects for active participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intervention was more effective in those who had incomes &gt;$50,000 (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.07-4.35) than in those who had lower incomes (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.53-2.94; P = .03 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interventions combining a patient-directed decision aid and practice-directed academic detailing had a modest but statistically nonsignificant effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates among active participants </plain></SENT>
