<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening test preference and examine the association between test preference and test completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n = 1224) were 50-70 years, at average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, and overdue for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome variables were preference for fecal occult blood test (FOBT), colonoscopy (COL), sigmoidoscopy (SIG), or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema (BE), measured by telephone survey, and concordance between test preference and test completed assessed using medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five percent preferred FOBT, 41.1% COL, 12.7% SIG, and 5.7% BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preference for SIG or COL was associated with having a physician recommendation, greater screening readiness, test-specific self-efficacy, greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> worry, and perceived pros of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preference for FOBT was associated with self-efficacy for doing FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants who preferred COL were more likely to complete COL compared with those who preferred another test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those screened, only 50% received their preferred test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those not receiving their preferred test most often received COL (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lack of concordance between patient preference and test completed suggests that patients' preferences are not well incorporated into screening discussions and test decisions, which could contribute to low screening uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physicians should acknowledge patients' preferences when discussing test options and making recommendations, which may increase patients' receptivity to screening </plain></SENT>
