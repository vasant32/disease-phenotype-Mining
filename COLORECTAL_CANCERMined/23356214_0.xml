<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinicians are still faced with numerous challenges in the treatment of this disease, and future approaches which target the molecular features of the disorder will be critical for success in this disease setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic analyses of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> have shown that up to 100 protein-encoding genes are mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, numerous genetic alterations have been identified in a number of pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, understanding the molecular pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may present information on potential routes for treatment and may also provide valuable prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This will be particularly pertinent for molecularly targeted treatments, such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS and BRAF mutations have been shown to predict response to anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As EGFR can also signal via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) kinase pathway, there is considerable interest in the potential roles of members of this pathway (such as PI3K and PTEN) in predicting treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a combined approach of new techniques that allow identification of these biomarkers alongside interdisciplinary approaches to the treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> will aid in the treatment decision-making process and may also serve to guide future therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
