<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the metastatic cascade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e>, detachment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells from each other is a very important step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been shown in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types, that reduced expression of these proteins is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to clarify the expression profile of these proteins, and correlate the findings with the metastasizing potential of early stage colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded samples from 79 Dukes B2 stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were examined using a tissue microarray approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of β-catenin and E-cadherin proteins was determined immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicated that there is a tendency for metastatic spread in cases when membranous expression of β-catenin is lost (p = 0.062) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in negative cases developed more rapidly, than in positive ones (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival rate was worse in the negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> was significantly higher in the β-catenin membranously negative than positive groups (p = 0.024) and in case of β-catenin nuclear expression the risk was also higher (p = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduced E-cadherin expression also correlated with development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, but this association was statistically not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical analysis of 79 cases shows that in Dukes B2 stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e> clarification of β-catenin and E-cadherin expression patterns is reliable for predicting the metastatic potential of early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and hence the method may have relevant implications in the therapeutic management of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
