<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">Nitroso</z:chebi>-N-methylurea (MNU) was used as carcinogen, which was administrated intragastrically at a dose of 50 mg/kg on the 23rd and 26th day of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we investigated the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of fecal water from experimental animals in the Caco 2 cell line, evaluated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>/NRU tests and the comet assay, respectively, as well as by the count of bacteria adhered to colon epithelium assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental rats were divided into four groups based on diet type: basal diet, basal diet supplemented with FBJ, basal diet and MNU treatment, and basal diet supplemented with FBJ and MNU treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FBJ significantly reduced the number of ACF in MNU-treated rats (from 55±18 to 21±6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of extensive aberrations (more than 4 crypts in a focus) decreased from 45±21 to 7±4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fecal water obtained from rats fed with an MNU-containing diet induced pronounced cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in Caco 2 cells, but FBJ supplementation of the diet abolished these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of FBJ in the diet significantly increased the count of bacteria, including Lactobacillus/Enterococcus, adhered to colonic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, supplementation of the diet with lactofermented beetroot juice may provide protection against precancerous aberrant crypt formation and reduce the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of fecal water </plain></SENT>
