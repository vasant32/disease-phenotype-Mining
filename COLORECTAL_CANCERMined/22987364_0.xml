<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, in a combined study of Australian and Polish LS patients, only MLH1 mutation carriers were found to be at increased risk of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A combined analysis of the three data-sets was performed to better define this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This cohort-study includes three sample populations combined totaling 1,352 individuals from 424 families with a molecular diagnosis of LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven SNPs, from six different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility loci, were genotyped by both research groups and the data analyzed collectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified associations at two of the six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility loci in MLH1 mutation carriers from the combined LS cohort: 11q23.1 (rs3802842, HR = 2.68, p ≤ 0.0001) increasing risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and rs3802842 in a pair-wise combination with 8q23.3 (rs16892766) affecting age of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (log-rank test; p ≤ 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in the age of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of 28 years was observed in individuals carrying three risk alleles compared to those with 0 risk alleles for the pair-wise SNP combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A trend (due to significance threshold of p ≤ 0.0010) was observed in MLH1 mutation carriers towards an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for the pair-wise combination (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the role of modifier loci in LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We consider that LS patients with MLH1 mutations would greatly benefit from additional genotyping of SNPs rs3802842 and rs16892766 for personalized risk assessment and a tailored surveillance program </plain></SENT>
