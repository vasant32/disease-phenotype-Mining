<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a hospital-based case-control study, including 435 cases and 788 unrelated controls to investigate the associations between common variants on 8q24 and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the association of rs6983267 with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the published literature via a meta-analysis study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that rs6983267 was significantly associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the Chinese population, with an adjusted odds-ratio (OR) for the GT heterozygotes and GG homozygotes of 1.30 (95% CI= 0.98-1.71, P = 0.069) and 1.66 (95% CI = 1.18-2.34, P = 0.004), respectively, compared to the TT homozygotes, with a P-trend value of 0.003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No association was found for the other three loci (rs16901979, rs1447295 and rs7837688) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the meta-analysis of the published genetic association studies, the rs6983267 variant was found to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The heterozygous GT carriers showed a 20% increased risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (OR= 1.20, 95% CI= 1.16-1.25; random effects model) with a summary OR for homozygous GG carriers of 1.39 (95% CI= 1.32-1.48; random effects model) compared to the TT genotype carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no significant differences between the association of rs6983267 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study confirms that the variant rs6983267 is a risk factor for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in various populations, including the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
