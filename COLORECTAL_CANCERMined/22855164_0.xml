<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients aged 44 years and younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were identified from a prospectively maintained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> database and divided into two groups by age: younger and older group (≤44 and &gt;44 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 530 patients aged ≤44 years at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More patients in the younger group had a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Younger patients were more likely than older patients to have larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, infiltrative growth type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, mucinous and signet-ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and advanced TNM stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to older patients, more younger patients received chemotherapy and died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival, disease-free survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival of younger patients were comparable to older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood transfusion, TNM stage, histological grade and disease recurrence were independently associated with survival in the younger group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite younger patients having unfavourable clinicopathologic features, younger age at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> appears to be associated with similar oncologic outcomes as compared to older patients </plain></SENT>
