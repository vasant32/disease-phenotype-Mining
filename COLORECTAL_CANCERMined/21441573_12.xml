<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an effort to ensure optimal, uniform, and reliable community-based KRAS testing throughout Europe, a KRAS external quality assessment (EQA) scheme was set up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first large assessment round included 59 laboratories from eight different European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each country, one regional scheme organizer prepared and distributed the samples for the participants of their own country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The samples included unstained sections of 10 invasive colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> with known KRAS mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The samples were centrally validated by one of two reference laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The laboratories were allowed to use their own preferred method for histological evaluation, DNA isolation, and mutation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyze the setup of the KRAS scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the regional scheme organization by analyzing the outcome of genotyping results, analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> percentage, and written reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that only 70% of laboratories correctly identified the KRAS mutational status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both the false-positive and false-negative results observed negatively affect patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reports of the KRAS test results often lacked essential information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We aim to further expand this program to more laboratories to provide a robust estimate of the quality of KRAS testing in Europe, and provide the basis for remedial measures and harmonization </plain></SENT>
