<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to determine the completeness and accuracy of endoscopy data in several administrative data sources in the year prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis as part of a larger project focused on evaluating the quality of pre-diagnostic care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary and secondary data sources for endoscopy were collected from the Alberta <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> medical charts and three different administrative data sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1672 randomly sampled patients diagnosed with invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in years 2000-2005 in Alberta, Canada were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A retrospective validation study of administrative data for endoscopy in the year prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A gold standard dataset was created by combining <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Number and percent identified, agreement and percent unique to a given data source were calculated and compared across each dataset and to the gold standard with respect to identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent endoscopy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endoscopies received by those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combined administrative data and physician billing data identified as high or higher percentage of patients who had one or more endoscopy (84% and 78%, respectively) and total endoscopy procedures (89% and 81%, respectively) than the chart review (78% for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopy data has a high level of completeness and accuracy in physician billing data alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined with hospital in/outpatient data it is more complete than chart review alone </plain></SENT>
