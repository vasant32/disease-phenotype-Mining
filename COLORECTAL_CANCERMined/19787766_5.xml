<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective national cohort study of 577 patients with local recurrence after major resection (R0/R1) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> between November 1993 and December 2001 (initial cohort of 4504 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 577 patients, 185 (32.1 per cent) had curative resections (R0/R1), 203 (35.2 per cent) had palliative radiotherapy with or without palliative surgery and chemotherapy, and 189 (32.8 per cent) received no treatment at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or only palliative surgery or chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival rate was 14.9 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven patients had an R0 resection, and 88 had an R1 resection, with 5-year overall survival of 55 and 20 per cent respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This outcome reflected surgical treatment in 33 different hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some 274 patients (47.5 per cent) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate after R0 resection was 62 per cent in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Obtaining an R0 resection is the most important prognostic factor in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278554" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
