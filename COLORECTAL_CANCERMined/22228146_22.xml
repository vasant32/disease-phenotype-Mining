<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mortality after 7-10 years of follow-up has been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 76 685 men, aged 55-74 years, were enrolled at 10 screening centers between November 1993 and July 2001 and randomly assigned to the intervention (organized screening of annual PSA testing for 6 years and annual DRE for 4 years; 38 340 men) and control (usual care, which sometimes included opportunistic screening; 38 345 men) arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening was completed in October 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31, 2009, were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) were estimated as the ratio of observed rates in the intervention and control arms, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poisson regression modeling was used to examine the interactions with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> mortality between trial arm and age, comorbidity status, and pretrial PSA testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 92% of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57% to 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 13 years, 4250 participants had been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> in the intervention and control arms were 108.4 and 97.1 per 10 000 person-years, respectively, resulting in a relative increase of 12% in the intervention arm (RR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After 13 years of follow-up, the cumulative mortality rates from <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> in the intervention and control arms were 3.7 and 3.4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 10 000 person-years, respectively, resulting in a non-statistically significant difference between the two arms (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.87 to 1.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant interactions with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> mortality were observed between trial arm and age (P(interaction) = .81), pretrial PSA testing (P(interaction) = .52), and comorbidity (P(interaction) = .68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After 13 years of follow-up, there was no evidence of a mortality benefit for organized annual screening in the PLCO trial compared with opportunistic screening, which forms part of usual care, and there was no apparent interaction with age, baseline comorbidity, or pretrial PSA testing </plain></SENT>
