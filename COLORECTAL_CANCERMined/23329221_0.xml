<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is considerable controversy among the data in the literature regarding the results of surgical treatment and prognostic factors of survival, and no analysis have been done in a large cohort of patients in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To characterize the results of surgical treatment of patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, and to establish prognostic factors of survival in a Brazilian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in a tertiary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> hospital from 1998 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed epidemiologic variables and the clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> and its treatment, surgical procedures and follow-up, and survival results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival analyzes were done by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was applied to determine the influence of variables on overall and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> variables associated with survival with P&lt;0.20 in univariate analysis, were included in multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazard regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the period analyzed, 209 procedures were performed on 170 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postope-rative mortality in 90 days was 2.9% and 5-year overall survival was 64.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its independent prognostic factors were the presence of extrahepatic disease at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, bilateral nodules and the occurrence of major complications after liver surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The estimated 5-year disease-free survival was 39.1% and its prognostic factors included R1 resection, extrahepatic disease, bilateral nodules, lymph node involvement in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> located in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> is safe and effective and the analysis of prognostic factors of survival in a large cohort of Brazilian patients showed similar results to those pointed in international series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of major postoperative complications appears to be able to compromise overall survival and further investigation in needed in this topic </plain></SENT>
