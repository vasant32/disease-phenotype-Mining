<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have locally advanced disease with peritoneal involvement (T4a) or invasion of adjacent organs (T4b) at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of patients who undergo resection with curative intent, between 7 and 33% develop isolated locoregional recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>R0 surgical excision is potentially curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the literature relating to multivisceral resection for T4 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comprehensive staging to identify the local and systemic extent of disease is essential to determine resectability and patient suitability for a curative approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PET scans and pelvic MRI (rectal) staging and a coordinated multispecialty input to neoadjuvant treatment, multivisceral surgical resection, reconstruction and adjuvant chemotherapy are essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative radiotherapy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy may have a role in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R0 resection can achieve 5-year local control rates for primary locally advanced and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> of up to 89 and 38%, respectively, and overall 5-year survival up to 66 and 25%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An aggressive surgical strategy as part of a multimodal strategy in the treatment of locally advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> in the absence of incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> affords the best prospect for long-term survival in selected patients </plain></SENT>
