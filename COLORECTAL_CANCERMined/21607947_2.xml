<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study on 45,241 (14,178 men; 31,063 women) volunteers of the EPIC-Italy cohort who completed a dietary questionnaire including specific questions on yogurt intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During 12 years of follow-up, 289 volunteers were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) for the disease and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazard models, stratified by dietary questionnaire and adjusted for energy intake and other potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Yogurt intake was inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the energy-adjusted model, HR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the highest versus lowest tertile of yogurt intake was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.46-0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the full model adjusted for energy, simple sugar, calcium, fiber, animal fat, alcohol and red meat intake, as well as body mass index, smoking, education and physical activity, HR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.89) in the highest versus lowest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of yogurt was evident in the entire cohort, but was stronger in men, although there was no interaction of sex with the yogurt-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> association (p(interaction) 0.20, fully adjusted model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our prospective study, high yogurt intake was significantly associated with decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, suggesting that yogurt should be part of a diet to prevent the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Investigation of larger cohorts is necessary to reveal any residual confounding of the association of yogurt intake with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
