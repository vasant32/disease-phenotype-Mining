<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing the beneficial intestinal microflora by consumption of prebiotics, which are 'functional foods', could be an elegant way to limit the number and incidence of disorders and to recover from dysbiosis or antibiotic treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the short-chain low-digestible carbohydrates (LDCs) which are metabolized by gut microbiota serving as energy source, immune system enhancers or facilitators of mineral uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intake of foods containing LDCs can improve the state of health and may prevent diseases as for example certain forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given the large number of different molecules belonging to LDCs, we focused our attention on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28796">fructans</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15443">inulin</z:chebi>, fructo-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi>), galacto-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> and resistant starches and their therapeutic and protective applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence is accumulating that LDCs can inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> by modulating host defense responses and by changing the interactions between pathogenic and beneficial bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animal studies and studies on small groups of human subjects suggest that LDCs might help to counteract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The action mechanisms of LDCs in the human body might be broader than originally thought, perhaps also including reactive oxygen species scavenging and signaling events </plain></SENT>
