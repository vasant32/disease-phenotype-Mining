<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The high incidence and the estimate of a five-year relative survival of 59% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Italy were the main reasons to investigate the management of Italian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed in the early 2000s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples of adult (â‰¥15 years) patients diagnosed in 2003-2005 with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomly selected in 8 Italian population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The z test was used to evaluate differences in proportions of Dukes stage, patients with at least 12 examined lymph nodes, and of cases treated with curative surgery plus chemotherapy or plus radiotherapy and diagnosed with colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios of receiving the selected treatment in each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry, age group and stage category, by anatomical subsite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 3,938 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About 40% of the cases were over 75 years of age at diagnosis and at Dukes A + B stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher proportions of early stages were found in the northern <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High percentages of resection with a curative intent were observed in Reggio Emilia (northern Italy), in 15 to 74-year-old patients, and at Dukes B stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At least 12 lymph nodes were more frequently examined in the north of the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and stage, no significant differences were seen in the odds ratios of receiving surgery plus chemotherapy between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries, whereas surgery plus radiotherapy was more frequent in Napoli (southern Italy) and less frequent in Biella (northern Italy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Some disparities in staging and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients persist across Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>National oncological plans still need to reduce inequalities in provision and access to proper care </plain></SENT>
