<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These factors included depth of invasion, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastasis, lymphatic</z:e> invasion, venous invasion and histopathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 357 patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> who had had been treated by surgical resection were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One point was assigned to each of the five aforementioned <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related pathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FPSS score was determined by an aggregate of the points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was observed between the survival of patients with FPSS scores of 0 and 1, and 2 and 3 (P=0.0002); and FPSS scores of 2 and 3, and 4 and 5 (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the FPSS is a convenient criterion for stratifying the prognosis of patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
