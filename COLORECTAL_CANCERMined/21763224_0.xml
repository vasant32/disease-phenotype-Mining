<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the efficacy of cetuximab when administered after bevacizumab failure is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients diagnosed with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between treated with cetuximab following irinotecan failure were included in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multivariate Cox model analysis was performed to estimate the effect of previous bevacizumab regimen on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen (22.4%) were pre-treated with anti-VEGF agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of them responded to cetuximab, and this subgroup presented a significantly decreased disease-specific survival as compared to treatment-na√Øve patients (9.1 months vs. 4.9 months; p=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference remained statistically significant in a multivariate Cox model after adjusting for age, sex, performance status (PS), and K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> status (RR=2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.5, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These study results suggest that a previous anti-VEGF therapy decrease cetuximab efficiency </plain></SENT>
