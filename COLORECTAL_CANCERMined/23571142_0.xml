<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed 137 consecutive patients who underwent curative surgery for stage I to III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors, including <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) p53, cyclooxygenase-2, CD44, and CD133 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, were determined using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and clinical outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was correlated with the expression of CD44 and CD133 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (p = 0.005 and p = 0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up period of 64 months, the 5-year disease-free survival rate of patients with elevated wt-p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly higher than that of those patients with low levels of wt-p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (84.9% and 67.6%, respectively; p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis identified 3 independent factors that substantially affected the disease-free survival: depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and wt-p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-free survival rate in patients with stage III or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e> differed significantly between the low and high wt-p53 expression groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, high wt-p53 expression was associated with better survival than low wt-p53 expression in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant association between combined p53/CD44 expression and survival was evident (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Expression of p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is a useful predictor of survival in patients with stage III or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e>, with a significant association with CD44 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
