<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of first-line standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and to explore how to optimize therapeutic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: First, meta-analysis and pooled analysis of three randomized, controlled trials were used to compare response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and grade 3 or 4 adverse events (G3/4AEs) of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (n = 1169) with those of chemotherapy alone (n = 1148) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second, using six different regimens plus bevacizumab, the Spearman method was used to analyze the correlation between these regimens and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, one-way ANOVA was used to compare OS in these regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab increased RR by 3.8%, prolonged PFS by 3.0 months and OS by 3.3 months, and increased G3/4AEs by 7.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found in PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65; p = 0.000), OS (HR = 0.79; p = 0.000), and G3/4AEs (risk ratio = 1.12; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no statistical difference was found in RR (odds ratio = 1.32; p = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimal regimens with regard to mean OS were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and irinotecan (CAPIRI) plus bevacizumab (24.00 months) and fluorouracil, leucovorin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX) plus bevacizumab (23.97 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: First-line standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab conferred a significant improvement in OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In combination with bevacizumab, both CAPIRI and FOLFOX are favorable regimens, though further studies are needed to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
