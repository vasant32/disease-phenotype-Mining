<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over expression of GSTO2 induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding GSTO2 was localized to human chromosome 10q24.3, a region that may harbor gene(s) involved in the developing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association between GSTO2 N142D genetic polymorphism and susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> the present study was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 63 (26 females, 37 males) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and 126 (52 females, 74 males) healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control subjects were frequency matched for age and gender with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genotypes were performed using RFLP-PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ND and DD genotypes were not associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, in comparison with the NN genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Family history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the first degree of relatives significantly differed between cases and controls (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The profiles of GSTO2 genotypes and family history in control and cancerous groups were compared to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects with NN genotype and positive family history significantly were at high risk to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in comparison with subjects with DD or ND genotypes and negative family history (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Present findings indicating that GSTO2 NN genotype increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in persons with positive family history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the first degree relatives </plain></SENT>
