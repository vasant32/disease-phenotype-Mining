<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined perioperative outcomes in nonagenarians undergoing abdominal surgery, and fewer have reported on 1-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to determine the outcomes of abdominal surgery in nonagenarians and to assess the performance of Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity (POSSUM) and Portsmouth-POSSUM (p- POSSUM) as predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients 90 years and older who underwent abdominal surgery between 2000 and 2007 at a tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 145 patients (median age 91, range 90-101 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common diagnoses were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (19.3%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> (19.3%), and the most common procedures were bowel resection with anastomosis (25.5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> repair (18.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall in-hospital mortality was 15.2% (20.8% in the emergent group and 9.6% in the elective group; p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 1-year mortality (49.1% v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>27.8%; p = 0.016), complication (81.9% v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>61.6%; p = 0.007) and intensive care unit admission rates (44.4% v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>11.0%; p &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher among emergent than elective surgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The operative indications and procedures associated with the highest in-hospital mortality were large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> (42.3%) and bowel resection with anastomosis (27.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both the POSSUM and p-POSSUM scoring systems significantly overpredicted mortality, particularly in higher risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nonagenarians undergoing abdominal surgery have substantial operative morbidity and mortality, particularly in emergent surgical cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nearly 50% of patients who undergo emergency procedures die within 1 year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The POSSUM and p-POSSUM scoring systems were not reliable predictors of in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
