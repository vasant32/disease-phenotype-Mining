<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Five hundred and fifty seven consecutive patients underwent an elective laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection by the same surgical team between April 2007 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No risk patients in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class 1 (Group N, n=222), low risk patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> under the control in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class 2 and 3 (Group L, n=320), high risk patients with severe comorbidities in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class 4 (Group H, n=15) were respectively compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median blood loss count was significantly higher than the other group (N: 26 g, L: 22 g) in group H (59 g; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hands, the less lymphadenectomy was performed and a reconstruction with anastomosis was denied in group H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative complications was not significantly different in each group (N: 12%, L: 18%, H: 26%; p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was the significant difference of the incidence with systemic complication (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e>) in group H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median postoperative hospital stay was not significantly different in each group (POD7; p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hospitalization <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in three patients (0.5%) by uncontrollability of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e>, two patients in group L and one patient in group H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colorectal resection for high risk patients was performed safely without increasing complications and postoperative hospital stay </plain></SENT>
