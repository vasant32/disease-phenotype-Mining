<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the short-term efficacy of a hope-based intervention program in increasing hope levels and decreasing psychopathology among HCRC genetic testing recipients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants joined a hope-based intervention program consisting of six sessions of weekly closed group therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Psychological questionnaires were administered immediately before the first and after the last sessions of the program measuring hope, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> levels of the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 22 participants (7 men and 15 women) at a mean age of 49.4 ± 9.6 years </plain></SENT>
