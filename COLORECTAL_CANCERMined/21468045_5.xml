<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of GDF15 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays were used to analyse GDF15 protein expression in 320 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of 60 patients, the level of GDF15 protein in plasma was also measured using a solid-phase proximity ligation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with moderate to high intensity of GDF15 immunostaining had a higher recurrence rate compared with patients with no or low intensity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages (stages I-III) (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.16-13.15) and in stage III (HR, 10.32; 95% CI, 1.15-92.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with high plasma levels of GDF15 had statistically shorter time to recurrence (P=0.041) and reduced overall survival (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Growth differentiation factor 15 serves as a negative prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High expression of GDF15 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue and high plasma levels correlate with an increased risk of recurrence and reduced overall survival </plain></SENT>
