<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 168 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> that were sequentially examined by conventional endoscopy followed by magnifying endoscopy and EUS in the same session to evaluate invasion depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic images obtained by each technique were reassessed by 3 endoscopists to determine whether endoscopic resection (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, or submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with slight invasion) or colectomy (submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with massive invasion or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e>) was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of differential diagnosis was compared among the examination techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of correct differential diagnosis according to endoscopic examination technique was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of lesions that were difficult to diagnose was significantly higher for EUS (15.5%) than for conventional endoscopy and magnifying endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among lesions that could be diagnosed, the rate of correct differential diagnosis was the highest for EUS (89.4%), but did not significantly differ among three endoscopic examination techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When it is difficult to evaluate the invasion depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> on conventional endoscopy alone, the combined use of different examination techniques such as EUS may enhance diagnostic accuracy in some lesions </plain></SENT>
