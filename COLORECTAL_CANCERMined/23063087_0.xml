<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of long-term outcomes for 40 patients who underwent mesh repair for VH during bowel resection between 2000 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrence (R) were compared with others (NR) and univariate and multivariate analysis of factors associated with recurrence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients (60% male, mean age 61 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> underwent repair with non-absorbable mesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the course of follow-up medical visits (median follow-up of 3.0 years; 25th percentile, 75th percentile: 1.8 years, 4.6 years), mesh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate was 22.5% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> recurrence rate 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>R (n=16) and NR (n=24) had similar age, gender, body mass index, steroid use, smoking history, and drain use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater proportion of R had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.04), larger fascial defect (p=0.02), emergency surgery (p=0.001), and wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, duration of follow-up (p=0.001), comorbidity (p=0.02), large defect size (p=0.04), emergency surgery (p=0.001) and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (p=0.001) were the only factors independently associated with recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of non-absorbable mesh during colorectal resection should be very selective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity, duration of follow-up, emergency operations, size of area covered and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> are independent factors associated with recurrence </plain></SENT>
