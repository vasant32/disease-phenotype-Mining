<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection is the mainstay therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and pathologic assessment of the resected specimen provides data for assessment of outcome and rationale for adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A pathology report includes TNM stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type, histologic grade, status of resection margins, and vascular invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim: The purpose of this paper was to highlight the pathological features and their correlations with postoperative evolution and prognosis of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data was collected using the database system of the Emergency County Hospital of Craiova, Romania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 302 patients from January 2003 to December 2005 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average survival for the entire group was 44.35 ± 28.94 months, and the D'Agostino-Pearson test for batch distribution showed abnormal distribution with two peaks, separated by a group of five patients who survived between 37 and 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one (38.05%) patients presented a median survival of 73.54 ± 10.47 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Factors that contribute to a favorable prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are vegetant gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and papillary microscopic forms, G1 and G2 degree of differentiation and disease diagnosed in stages I and II </plain></SENT>
