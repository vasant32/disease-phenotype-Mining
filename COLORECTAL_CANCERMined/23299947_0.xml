<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately attendance at this outreach clinic has been declining over several years and fewer than a quarter of participants, attending for surveillance, have been adherent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> their recommended screening appointments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concerns exist for non-adherent individuals as screening can prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by removing the precancerous lesion or enabling the treatment of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study explored the experience of surveillance from both the non-adherers' and adherers' perspectives and identified unique factors affecting attendance at the outreach clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates of compliance are calculated for 191 mutation-positive cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, using strict attendance criteria, and compared to figures obtained from self-reported attendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-compliance was under-reported and compliance was exaggerated when basing data on self-reported adherence to recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific characteristics of the outreach clinic affecting compliance are identified and recommendations are made to facilitate improvements to the service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These improvements can result in increased compliance with screening regimens and ultimately reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related mortality </plain></SENT>
