<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16664">Albendazole</z:chebi> (ABZ) is a microtubule-targeting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35443">anthelmintic</z:chebi> with a remarkable activity against a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined if the antitumor activity of ABZ could be enhanced by its combination with other microtubule-binding agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The interactions between ABZ and microtubule-binding agents, paclitaxel, vinblastine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, and 2-methoxyestradiol were characterized using median effect analysis method in HCT-116 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and DU145 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying the synergistic interaction related to tubulin polymerization and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was then investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the effect of the combination therapy on the survival of HCT-116 tumor-bearing <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the tested drugs, a synergistic anti-proliferative effect was observed with the combination of low concentrations of ABZ plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and ABZ plus 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exploring the mechanism of the interaction between ABZ and 2ME revealed that the combination therapy synergistically activated the extrinsic pathway of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with in vitro results, the combination of low concentration of ABZ with 2ME prolonged the survival of mice-bearing HCT-116 tumors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High concentration of ABZ in combination with 2ME, however, proved to be less effective than ABZ alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of low doses of ABZ and 2ME has shown promising results in our pre-clinical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the finding that the combination of two microtubule-binding agents that share the same binding site can act synergistically may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
