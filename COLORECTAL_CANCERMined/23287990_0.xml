<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom performs poorly in international comparisons of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survival with much of the deficit owing to high numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> close to the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective cohort study investigates the patient, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and treatment characteristics of those who die in the first year after diagnosis of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with colon (n=65,733) or rectal (n=26,123) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in England between 2006 and 2008 were identified in the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Data Repository </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 1 month, 1-3 months and 3-12 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 11.5% of colon and 5.4% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients died within a month of diagnosis: this proportion decreased significantly over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites, older age, stage at diagnosis, deprivation and emergency presentation were associated with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals who died shortly after diagnosis were also more likely to have missing data about important prognostic factors such as disease stage and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using routinely collected data, at no inconvenience to patients, we have identified some important areas relating to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, which merit further research </plain></SENT>
