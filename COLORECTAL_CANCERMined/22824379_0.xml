<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e>, either due to changes in protein expression, or through association with the rs2294008 polymorphism in the PSCA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the role of PSCA in the development of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a genotyping study to assess for associations between the rs2294008 polymorphism and risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA samples were available from 388 individuals with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and 496 controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had undergone screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we performed immunohistochemical staining for PSCA in colonic tissue representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No genotypic associations were found between the rs2294008 polymorphism and the risk of colorectal adenomata or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining did not reveal any alteration in PSCA expression accompanying the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From these data it seems unlikely that PSCA has a role in the initiation or progression of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
