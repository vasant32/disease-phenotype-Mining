<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: : The expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 protein in 121 pretreatment tissue samples from locally advanced rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients was detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: : Pathological response to radiotherapy was evaluated according to <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grading by postoperative histological examinations after they received long-course preoperative neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and the association between clinicopathological data and <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grading was analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For further validation, short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was constructed and transfected into colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line HT29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The knockdown efficiency was confirmed at both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The altered radiosensitivity was evaluated by methylthiazolyl tetrazolium assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and Hoechst 33258 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Univariate analysis revealed that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 expression (p &lt; 0.001), P53 type (p = 0.069), and CEA (p = 0.100) were possibly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grading, and multivariate analysis demonstrated that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 expression (p &lt; 0.001) and P53 type (p = 0.039) were positively correlated with response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lentiviral vector was successfully introduced into HT29 cells and inhibited ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 expression efficiently and persistently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 expression significantly enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation, decreased colony formation capacity, and increased cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by irradiation, as examined by a series of experiments in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, radiobiological parameters calculated according to the single-hit multitarget model were also decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : Our data indicate that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 may be a useful molecular marker in predicting radiosensitivity, and a potential target in improving the response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
