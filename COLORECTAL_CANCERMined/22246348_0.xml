<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line, HCT-116, was examined with respect to cell survival after blockade of irradiation-induced autophagosome formation by pharmacological interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autophagosome formation was confirmed using a kinetic study with incorporated bovine serum albumin gold-conjugate (BSA-Au) analyzed by electron microscopy and an autophagosome-associated LC3B antibody measured by immunofluorescence and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Annexin V/PI double staining was used to monitor cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and cell cycle profiles by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ionizing radiation (IR) promoted autophagosome formation in the HCT-116 IR-surviving cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological interference showed that PI3K/Akt and Src were involved in early stages of autophagosome formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IR alone <z:mp ids='MP_0000352'>decreased cell proliferation</z:mp> by arresting cells in the G2/M phase, and pharmacological interference of autophagosome formation decreased proliferation, but did not affect cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, our data suggest that decreased proliferation caused by PI3K and Src inhibitors could be through S phase cell cycle delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results clearly indicate that blockade of IR-induced autophagosome formation impairs proliferation but does not enhance cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
