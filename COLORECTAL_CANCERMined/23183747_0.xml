<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of miR-34 impairs TP53-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, while overexpression of miR-34 induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A potentially functional polymorphism (i.e., rs4938723T/C) in the promoter region of pri-miR-34b/c was predicted to influence the GATA-X binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the association between miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphisms and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We genotyped the two polymorphisms in 347 CRC patients and 488 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the CC genotype and C allele of the miR-34b/c rs4938723 were associated with a significantly decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with the TT genotype and T allele (CC vs. TT: adjusted OR=0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.91; C vs. T: adjusted OR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In combined analysis, a borderline significance was also observed in subjects carrying the rs4938723 CT/CC and TP53 GG genotypes (adjusted OR=0.66; 95% CI, 0.43-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the rs4938723 in the promoter region of pri-miR-34b/c was a protective factor for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the significance is marginal, further replication studies are warranted to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
