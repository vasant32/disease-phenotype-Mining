<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: We collected 300 consecutive colorectal resections between 2002 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: group A was composed by patients younger than 80 years old and group B by patients older than 80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were evaluated with t-test and chi-square test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analyzed 180 women and 120 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 66 years old (range, 30-90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most frequent indications were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (46%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> (35%) and extra-colic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group B was composed of 60 patients (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Old patients had more concomitant diseases (62% vs. 33%, p&lt;0.005), but complications, mortality and hospital stay were comparable in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical emergency increases morbidity (38% vs. 9%) and mortality (13.45 vs. 0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal resections can be performed with good results in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A colic disease must be detected before the patient develops a surgical complication because urgent surgery has more complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> compared to elective surgery, especially for older patients </plain></SENT>
