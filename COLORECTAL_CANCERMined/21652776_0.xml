<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> test recommendation patterns and associated factors and their relationship to patient test completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This cross-sectional study used a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> survey, in-depth <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> interviews, and electronic medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northwest health maintenance organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 132 PCPs and 49,259 eligible patients aged 51 to 75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The authors grouped <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> by patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations based on reported frequency of recommending fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They then compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> demographics, reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test influences, concerns, decision-making and counseling processes, and actual rates of patient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening completion by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors identified 4 CRC screening recommendation groups: a "balanced" group (n = 54; 40.9%) that recommended the tests nearly equally, an FOBT group (n = 31; 23.5%) that largely recommended FOBT, an FOBT + FS group (n = 25; 18.9%), and a colonoscopy + FOBT group (n = 22; 16.7%) that recommended these tests nearly equally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Internal medicine (v. family medicine) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> were more common in groups more frequently recommending endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FOBT and FOBT + FS groups were most influenced by clinical guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Groups recommending more endoscopy were most concerned that FOBT generates a relatively high number of false positives and FOBT can miss <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The FOBT and FOBT + FS groups were more likely to recommend a specific screening strategy compared to the colonoscopy + FOBT and balanced groups, which were more likely to let the patient decide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates were 63.9% balanced, 62.9% FOBT, 61.7% FOBT + FS, and 62.2% colonoscopy + FOBT; rates did not differ significantly by group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Small numbers within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Specialty, the influence of guidelines, test concerns, and the "jointness" of the test selection decision distinguished <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patterns were associated with similar overall screening rates </plain></SENT>
