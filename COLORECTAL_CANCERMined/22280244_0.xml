<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite progresses made during the last decades, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains one of the most frequent and deadly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> in the western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A genomic study of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has been carried out on a total of 31 tumoral samples, corresponding to different stages of the disease, and 33 non-tumoral samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out by hybridisation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples against a reference pool of non-tumoral samples using Agilent Human 1A 60-mer oligo microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained were validated by qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent bioinformatics analysis, gene networks by means of Bayesian classifiers, variable selection and bootstrap resampling were built </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The consensus among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the induced models produced a hierarchy of dependences and, thus, of variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After an exhaustive process of pre-processing to ensure data quality--lost values imputation, probes quality, data smoothing and intraclass variability filtering--the final dataset comprised a total of 8, 104 probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Next, a supervised classification approach and data analysis was carried out to obtain the most relevant genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of them are directly involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> and in particular in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, a supervised classifier was induced to classify new unseen samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a tentative model for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> based on a biomarker panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the gene profile described herein can discriminate between non-cancerous and cancerous samples with 94.45% accuracy using different supervised classifiers (AUC values in the range of 0.997 and 0.955) </plain></SENT>
