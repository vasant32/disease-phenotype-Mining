<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the predictive value of Ki67 expression in postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, who were either treated with adjuvant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> (TAM) alone or with TAM followed by anastrozole (ANA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of Ki67 was determined centrally by immunohistochemistry on whole tissue sections of postmenopausal <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>-responsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> from patients who had been enrolled in the prospectively randomized Austrian Breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Study Group Trial 8, and had received TAM for 5 years, or TAM for 2 years followed by ANA for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ki67 expression was evaluated both as a continuous variable and dichotomized to low (â‰¤10%) and high (&gt;10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Cox models adjusted for clinical and pathologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a high Ki67 expression (394/1,587; 23%) had a significantly shorter <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (adjusted HR for recurrence = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.37-2.64, P = 0.0001) and OS (adjusted HR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.18-2.70, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumors</z:e> expressing medium or high ER levels (n = 1,438), the interaction between Ki67 and adjuvant <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> treatment was significant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TAM followed by ANA was superior to TAM alone in patients with low Ki67 (adjusted HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34-0.83, P = 0.005) but not in high Ki67 disease (adjusted HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.66-1.89, P = 0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant sequencing of TAM and ANA is superior to TAM alone, particularly in postmenopausal women with medium or high ER expressing, low proliferating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
