<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phase 1 trial assessed the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of rIL-21 in combination with cetuximab in chemo-naïve patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sequential cohorts of PS 0-1, asymptomatic patients, were treated weekly with cetuximab 250 mg m(-2) intravenously (i.v.) plus escalating i.v. doses of rIL-21 following an initial loading dose of cetuximab 400 mg m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment period was 8 weeks, with extension permitted in patients without disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 15 patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events related to rIL-21 or rIL-21 plus cetuximab included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> and were mainly ≤ grade 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One dose limiting toxicity occurred (grade 3 diarrhoea) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum tolerated dose was not determined because of the premature study closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximum administered dose was 100 μg kg(-1) rIL-21 weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 60% of the patients had stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immune activation was confirmed by various T- and NK-cell activation biomarkers, including dose-dependent increases in serum sCD25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: rIL-21 weekly combined with cetuximab is well tolerated at doses up to 100 μg kg(-1) and results in activation of immune response biomarkers </plain></SENT>
