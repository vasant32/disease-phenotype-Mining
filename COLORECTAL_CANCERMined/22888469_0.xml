<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially considered as a disease due to genetic mutations, it is now viewed as a complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> because of the involvement of epigenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A functional equivalence between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms has been suggested in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> initiation and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A hallmark of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is its pathogenetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> attained through at least three distinct pathways: a traditional (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence), an alternative, and more recently the so-called serrated pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the alternative pathway is more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and less characterized, the traditional and serrated pathways appear to be more homogeneous and clearly distinct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One unsolved question in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> biology concerns the cells of origin and from which crypt compartment the different pathways originate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on molecular and pathological evidences, we propose that the traditional and serrated pathways originate from different crypt compartments explaining their genetic/epigenetic and clinicopathological differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we will discuss the current knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> pathogenesis and, specifically, summarize the role of genetic/epigenetic changes in the origin and progression of the multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the link between the molecular and clinico-pathological aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> would improve our understanding of its etiology and impact both prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
