<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical success of (V600E)BRAF inhibition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, coupled with the emergence of acquired resistance, underscores the importance of rigorously validating quantitative biomarkers of treatment response in this and similar settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because constitutive activation of BRAF leads to proliferation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, we explored 3′-deoxy-3′-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) PET to noninvasively quantify changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> proliferation that are associated with pharmacologic inhibition of V600EBRAF downstream effectors and that precede changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines expressing (V600E)BRAF were used to explore relationships between upregulation of p27 and phosphorylation of BRAF downstream effectors on small-molecule (V600E)BRAF inhibitor exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice bearing (V600E)BRAF-expressing human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line xenografts were treated with a small-molecule (V600E)BRAF inhibitor (or vehicle) daily for 10 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictive (18)F-FLT PET was conducted before changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlations were evaluated among PET, inhibition of phosphorylated MEK (p-MEK) and phosphorylated-ERK (p-ERK) by Western blot, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> proliferation by histology, and small-molecule exposure by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines with PLX4720 reduced proliferation associated with target inhibition and upregulation of p27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, PLX4720 treatment reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FLT uptake, but not (18)F-FDG uptake, in Lim2405 xenografts before quantifiable differences in xenograft volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced (18)F-FLT PET reflected a modest, yet significant, reduction of Ki67 immunoreactivity, inhibition of p-MEK and p-ERK, and elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell p27 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both (18)F-FLT PET and (18)F-FDG PET accurately reflected a lack of response in HT-29 xenografts, which MALDI imaging mass spectrometry suggested may have stemmed from limited PLX4720 exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We used preclinical models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> to demonstrate (18)F-FLT PET as a sensitive predictor of response to V600EBRAF inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because (18)F-FLT PET predicted reduced proliferation associated with attenuation of BRAF downstream effectors, yet (18)F-FDG PET did not, these data suggest that (18)F-FLT PET may represent an alternative to (18)F-FDG PET for quantifying clinical responses to BRAF inhibitors </plain></SENT>
