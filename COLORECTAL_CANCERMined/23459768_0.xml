<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we look at the efficacy of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening methods, attributes and results within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MHS</z:e>, and current barriers to increase compliance.Materials and Methods: A literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed and the Cochrane library </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Directed searches were also performed of embedded references.Results: Despite screening guidelines from several national organizations, extensive barriers to widespread screening remain, especially for minority populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These barriers are diverse, ranging from education and access problems to personal beliefs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening rates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MHS</z:e> have been reported to be generally higher at 71% compared to national averages of 50-65%.Conclusion: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening can be highly effective at improving detection of both pre-malignant and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
