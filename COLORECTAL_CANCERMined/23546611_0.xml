<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results from the recent meta-analysis suggested a moderate favorable effect of coffee consumption on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, especially for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship, if exists, between coffee consumption and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the dose-response relationship was assessed by restricted cubic spline model and multivariate random-effect meta-regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that a significant association was found between coffee consumption and decreased risk of colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> among subjects consuming â‰¥4 cups of coffee per day </plain></SENT>
