<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> cell lines are characterized by a subtle modulation of CB levels which produces a modified responsiveness to specific ligands, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these events are poorly and partially understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously provided evidence that the endocannabinoid (EC) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2700">anandamide</z:chebi> (AEA) exerts anti-proliferative effect likely by modulation of the expression of genes involved in the cellular fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we focused on the role of the CB1 receptor, ECs, and steroids in the mechanisms involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell growth inhibition in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that, in DLD1 and SW620 cells, 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> induced a specific and strong up-regulation of the CB1 receptor by triggering activation of the CB1 promoting region, localized at the exon 1 of the CNR1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment of DLD1 and SW620 cells with Met-F-AEA, a stable AEA-analogous, or URB597, a selective inhibitor of FAAH, induced up-regulation of CB1 expression by co-localization of PPARγ and RXRα at the promoting region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, increased availability of AEA, of both exogenous and endogenous sources, induced the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor-beta in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results partially elucidated the role of EC system in the molecular mechanisms enrolled by steroids in the inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell growth and strongly suggested that targeting the EC system could represent a promising tool to improve the efficacy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatments </plain></SENT>
