<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify prognostic factors for local control, complications, and survival in our series of patients treated with GKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty patients (36 males, 44 females) with 140 metastases who received GKS between 1996 and 2008 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was 6.13 (0.01-35.5) cm(3); the prescription dose was 21.1 (10-25.1) Gy and the maximum dose 42.7 (17.2-66.7) Gy; and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cover was 95.0% (72%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Growth control was achieved in 93 of 121 tumors (76.9%) and 42 of 68 (61.8%) patients, while treatment failure was seen in 28 of 121 tumors (23.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local control was better if a high prescription dose of 25 Gy was used, 88.4% vs. 71.4% (P = 0.017), or if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was &lt;5 cm(3) (86.4%), compared with 69.9% for 5-20 cm(3) and 51.9% for &gt;20 cm(3) (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for local failure with lower prescription doses was 2.8 (P = 0.026) in the unadjusted, and 8.5 (P = 0.055) in the adjusted multivariate analysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volumes &gt;5 cm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 6 months (range 0-75) after GKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age &lt;70 years (P &lt; 0.001) and high RPA class (P = 0.032) were associated with longer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (22.1%) had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on follow-up MRI, possibly because of radiation damage to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was asymptomatic in 93.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found neither a decrease in the incidence of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> nor improved survival when whole-brain radiation therapy was given prior to GKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GKS provides reasonable local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Local control rate is highest if the margin dose is 25 Gy and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume &lt;5 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was common but rarely symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Survival is longest for young, well-functioning patients </plain></SENT>
