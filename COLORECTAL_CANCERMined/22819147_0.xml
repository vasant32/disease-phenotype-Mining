<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and long-term outcome of surgery combined with intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOERT) as rescue treatment in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic oligotopic extrapelvic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: From April 1996 to April 2010, we treated 28 patients using 34 IOERT procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main histopathology findings were <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (39%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites were gynecologic (67%), urologic (14%) and colorectal (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The location of recurrence was the para-aortic region in 53.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up was 39 months (1-84 months), during which time 14% of patients experienced local recurrence and 53.5% developed distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 57% and 35% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the time of the analysis, 13 patients were alive, 6 for more than 55 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local control was not significantly affected by the following histopathologic characteristics of the resected surgical specimen: number of fragments submitted for pathology study (1 to &gt;6), maximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dimension (≤ 2 to ≥ 6 cm), rate of involved nodes (0-100%) and involved resection margin (local recurrence 23% vs 7%; p = 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence was significantly affected by microscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in more than 50% of specimen fragments (38% vs 9%, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IOERT for recurrence of oligotopic extrapelvic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> increased long-term survival in patients with controlled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and appears to compensate for some adverse prognostic features in local control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Individualized treatment strategies for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> category of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent cancer</z:e> will make it possible to optimize results </plain></SENT>
