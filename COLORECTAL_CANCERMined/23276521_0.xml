<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon cancer</z:hpo> with mismatch repair deficiency and low TS expression has been associated with an improved prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data also indicate that MMR proficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> with high TS expression has a better response to adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates if a combined analysis of MMR status and TS expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> can add prognostic value and better predict response to adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential relationship between MMR status and TS expression is also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study includes a subgroup of 716 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> out of 2224 stage II and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> patients enrolled in Nordic trials randomized to surgery alone or surgery plus adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After immunohistochemical analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> MMR status and TS expression the patients were divided into 4 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a nonsignificant difference in overall survival between group 1 (patients with deficient MMR <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with low TS) and group 4 (patients with proficient MMR <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> expressing high TS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When comparing group 1 and group 4 patients treated with surgery alone a trend to better overall survival was found in group 1, P = .06 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 4, stage III patients had a significantly improved survival when receiving adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy compared with surgery alone, P = .01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between MMR status and TS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combined instead of a single marker analysis of MMR status and TS expression can improve the prediction of response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
