<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported multiple risk loci associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), some of which are involved in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We systematically examined associations of common genetic variations in the TGFβ signaling pathway and environmental factors with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk using a two-staged case-control study in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A set of 77 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 candidate genes involved in the TGFβ signaling pathway and several environmental factors including sex, age, smoking and drinking were examined by random forest (RF) to capture the potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in stage 1 of the study with 443 CRC patients and 480 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three promising SNPs (SMAD7 rs11874392, TGFBR1 rs10988706 and rs6478972) selected by the RF method were genotyped in stage 2 comprising 351 cases and 360 controls for validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SMAD7 rs11874392 presented consistently significant associations with a risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at both stages, with odds ratio = 1.41 (95% confidence interval = 1.21-1.63) using additive modes in combined analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the potential interactions between SMAD7 rs11874392, TGFBR1 rs10988706 and rs6478972 were indicated consistently in both stages of the study by using pair-wise interaction and multilocus genotype pattern analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, gene-smoking interactions for rs11874392, rs10988706 and rs6478972 were also found to enhance the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at both stages, with P for multiplicative interaction equal to 1.162×10(-6), 8.574×10(-8) and 9.410×10(-8) in combined analyses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study emphasized the substantial role of the TGFβ signaling pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, especially in interaction with smoking </plain></SENT>
