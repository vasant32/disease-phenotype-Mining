<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the past decade the revolutionary development of molecular technology contributed a lot to the increase of our knowledge on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These informations led to the discovery and understanding of those key regulatory changes in the genesis and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> that can serve as targets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diagnostics and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the main challenges in the research field is to identify the most important molecular networks, the molecular targets, the markers (biomarkers) which can predict therapeutic responsiveness in order to select the appropriate patients, as well as markers to judge the prognosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of our study approached some details of the biomarker area and reached certain conclusions: (1) The anti-EGFR therapy, used in the second line or even further, proved to be effective, providing clinical advantage (operability, regression) in 36% of patients carrying <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G13D mutations were the most frequent among the KRAS-mutants, which, according to current data, could react to anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) Extended immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples (using tissue microarray) found rather few correlations between the IHC estimation and the clinical characteristics related mainly to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the results with anti-EGFR antibodies in the diagnostic histological samples, the regulatory pathway which rules the proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa is also present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding is supported by the increased ativity of the downstream members (as <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, RAF, ERK) of the EGFR signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) The level of D-dimer increased at least as much as the level of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>D-dimer can be considered as a prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types studied (breast-, colorectal-, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e>) and its measurement is advised besides the classical markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We hope that these results may contribute to the design of a more individual-based and more effective antitumor strategy </plain></SENT>
