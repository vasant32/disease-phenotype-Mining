<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Method:  Analysis of overall survival was conducted using a nationwide Danish cohort of patients treated with curative resection of stage I-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 8901 patients in Denmark diagnosed with adenocacinoma of the colon and treated with curative resection in the period 2003-2008 were identified from the Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Group (DCCG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impact of lymph node count and lymph node ratio was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results:  Overall 5-year survival was 56.8% and 66.6%, (p&lt; .0001) for lymph node counts of &lt;12 and &gt;= 12, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages of lymph node positive patients in the two groups were 29.8% and 40.3% (p&lt; .0001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When subgrouping the stage III patients into four groups according to the lymph node ratio (cut-off points: 1/12, 1/4 and 1/2) we found an overall 5-year survival rate of 68.1%, 57.2%, 49.3% and 32.4% (p&lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lymph node count and lymph node ratio were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  High lymph node count was associated with improved overall survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lymph node ratio was superior to N-stage, in differentiating overall survival in stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
