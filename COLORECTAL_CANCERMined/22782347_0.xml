<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) registered with the Northern <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Audit Group database were cross-referenced with the BCSP database to analyse their screening history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> in the screening population between April 2007 and March 2010 were identified and classified into four groups: control (diagnosed before first screening invite), screen-detected, interval (diagnosed between screening rounds after a negative FOBt), and non-uptake (declined screening) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> characteristics and survival were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 511 out of 1336 (38.2%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were controls; 825 (61.8%) were in individuals invited for screening of which 322 (39.0%) were screen detected, 311 (37.7%) were in the non-uptake group, and 192 (23.3%) were interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control and interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> group, the screen-detected group had a higher proportion of men (P=0.002, P=0.003 respectively), left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumours</z:e> (P=0.007, P=0.003), and superior survival (both P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location/stage, or survival between control and interval groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FOBt is better at detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in the left colon and in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significant numbers of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> weren't found to have an improved outcome compared with the non-screened population </plain></SENT>
