<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: As a novel cell cycle-related gene, p42.3 has been shown to play a key role in the cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, the association between p42.3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the expression of p42.3 and its potential role in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to evaluate p42.3 mRNA and protein expression in 14 pairs of fresh frozen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples, matched with adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The p42.3 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue microarrays, which included 212 CRC specimens and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles of p42.3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues were analyzed against clinicopathological factors and post-surgical survival status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles of p42.3 were also investigated in six human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p42.3 was demonstrated to be over-expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa in the 14 tissue pairs (P = 0.011) and was significantly higher in patients with poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation (P = 0.045); patients positive for p42.3 expression had a poorer prognosis than those not expressing this protein (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate survival analysis, p42.3 expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (P = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that p42.3 might play an important role in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and it has a great value for assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient prognosis after surgery </plain></SENT>
