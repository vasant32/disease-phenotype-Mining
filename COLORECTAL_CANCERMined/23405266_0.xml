<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the use of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (APC)/β-catenin (CTNNB1) genes to predict outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We selected and genotyped 10 tSNP to predict common variants across entire APC and CTNNB1 genes in 282 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations of these tSNPs with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free survival and overall survival were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression model, and survival tree analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival rate was 68.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival tree analysis identified a higher-order genetic interaction profile consisting of the APC rs565453, CTNNB1 2293303, and APC rs1816769 that was significantly associated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival overall rates were 89.2%, 66.1%, and 58.8% for the low-, medium-, and high-risk genetic profiles, respectively (log-rank P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for possible confounders, including age, gender, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and lymph node involvement, the genetic interaction profile remained significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the studied SNPs were individually associated with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the genetic interaction profile among Wnt pathway SNPs might potentially increase the prognostic value in outcome prediction for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
