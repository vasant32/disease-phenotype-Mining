<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 311 lymph nodes were removed and examined from 90 patients with Stage I to IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of slices of histology sections ranged from 6 to 75 per node (average = 25.5; SD = 11.1), which provided a total of 7,943 slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes were examined in their entire volume at every 50-μm and 100-μm intervals for nodes smaller and larger than 5 mm respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total number of thin sections examined in each node and the number of thin sections where metastatic foci were present were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of thin sections with metastatic foci and the total number of slices was determined for each node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the presence or absence of metastatic foci in the "central" slice was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Micrometastases were found in 12/311 (3.9%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 12 lymph nodes with micrometastases, the rate of metastatic slices over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> slices was 39.4% (range = 6.3 to 81.3%; SD = 25.8%) In the central slice of each node, micrometastases were present only in 6 of 12 lymph nodes (50%); accordingly, they were not present in the central slice for half the micrometastatic nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These 6 nodes represented 1.9% of the 311 nodes and 11.1% of the 54 metastatic nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that a significant fraction of micrometastases can be missed by traditional singleslice sectioning; half of the micrometastases would have been overlooked in our data set of 311 nodes </plain></SENT>
