<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survival outcomes are less than optimal for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, with a 5-year survival in the 5% to 8% range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The development of new chemotherapeutic agents and effective combination regimens for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) has increased median overall survival (OS) to the 24- to 28-month range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the recognition that vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors are primary regulators of physiologic and <z:mp ids='MP_0003711'>pathologic angiogenesis</z:mp> and lymphangiogenesis, leading to neovascularization and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, the targeting of the angiogenic pathway has become a focus of key therapeutic strategies in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic regimens that include bevacizumab, an inhibitor of VEGF-A, in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, have resulted in improved response rate (RR) and survival in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of VEGF-A inhibition are often temporary, with resistance and disease progression developing in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proposed models include intrinsic and adaptive resistance, mediated by factors other than VEGF-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aflibercept (known as ziv-aflibercept in the United States; ZaltrapÂ®, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; sanofi-aventis), a novel recombinant fusion protein, is an angiogenic factor trap that blocks the binding of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phase I/II clinical trials have demonstrated effective activity in mCRC, with acceptable safety and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A recent phase III randomized double-blind trial in patients previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> reported significant improvement in OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and RR with aflibercept compared with placebo when administered in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were consistent with anti-VEGF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus aflibercept represents a potential new treatment option for patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
