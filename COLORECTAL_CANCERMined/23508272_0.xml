<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we studied the potential cytotoxic effects of short-chain and cell-permeable C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> in cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> HT-29 cells and focused on the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>-induced HT-29 cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and growth inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed in C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>-treated HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data support that autophagy contributed to C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxic effects, as autophagy inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi> (3-MA) and hydroxychloroquine, inhibited C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>'s effect; however, autophagy activators, everolimus (RAD001) and temsirolimus, mimicked C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> effects and induced HT-29 cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, we indentified that <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Ulk1 signaling was required for autophagy induction by C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>, and AMPK silencing by a specific short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> suppressed C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>-induced autophagy and cytotoxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reversely, forced activation of AMPK by its activator AICAR or by genetic manipulation caused autophagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in HT-29 cells, which was inhibited by 3-MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that autophagy, but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, is a major contributor for C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxic effects in HT-29 cells, and activation of AMPK/Ulk1 is required for the process </plain></SENT>
