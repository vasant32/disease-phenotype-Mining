<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to investigate the influence of NAFLD on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics and prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 227 patients who were first diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and underwent abdominal ultrasonography within six months prior to diagnosis at Samsung Medical Center between 2000 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the study population, 26.0% were diagnosed with NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon baseline comparison, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with NAFLD had higher BMI and ALT values than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients without NAFLD (25.3 ± 2.7 vs. 22.6 ± 3.0, P=0.000 and 26.6 ± 17.4 vs. 21.2 ± 14.0, P=0.018, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with NAFLD were diagnosed earlier than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients without NAFLD (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences between two groups with regard to location and differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, CEA or numbers of synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with NAFLD were 98.3%, 89.8%, and 86.4%, respectively, which were higher but statistically not significant than 90.4%, 79.6%, and 74.8%, respectively, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients without NAFLD (P=0.079) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, freedom from recurrence was similarly observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with and without NAFLD (89.8% and 87.3%, respectively, P=0.614) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the presence of NAFLD does not influence on the prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, especially with respect to disease recurrence during follow-up </plain></SENT>
