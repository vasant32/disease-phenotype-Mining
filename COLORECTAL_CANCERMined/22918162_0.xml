<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Staining variations that could potentially lead to erroneous interpretations have been recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recently recognized staining variation is the significant reduction of staining for MSH6 in some colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency and specific characteristics of this aberrant MSH6 staining pattern, however, have not been well analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study of 420 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> samples obtained from patients fulfilling the Revised Bethesda Guidelines, we detected 9 tumors (2%) showing extremely limited staining for MSH6 with positive staining present in &lt;5% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analyses showed that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> belonged to two distinct categories: (1) MLH1 and/or PMS2 protein-deficient <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (n=5, including 1 with a pathogenic mutation in PMS2); and (2) MLH1, PMS2 and MSH2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but with chemotherapy or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy before surgery (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test our hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> in the coding region microsatellite of the MSH6 gene might be a potential underlying mechanism for such limited MSH6 staining, we evaluated frameshift mutation in a (C)(8) tract in exon 5 of the MSH6 gene in seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that had sufficient DNA for analysis, and detected mutation in four; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> belonged to the MLH1/PMS2-deficient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data outline the main scenarios where significant reduction of MSH6 staining is more likely to occur in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> of the coding region microsatellites of the MSH6 gene is an underlying mechanism for this staining phenomenon in MLH1/PMS2-deficient <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
