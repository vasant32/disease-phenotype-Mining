<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify unmet supportive care needs of people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> following discharge from hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Health service utilization was used as a measure of expressed unmet need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective case note review was conducted of 521 patients surgically treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case notes maintained by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> nurse specialist were reviewed to identify postdischarge occasions-of-service where unmet need was expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was conducted to investigate predictors of unmet need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 521 patients, 219 (42%) patients had unmet supportive care needs, of which 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> needs was found in the physical domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six per cent of unmet needs was expressed within the first week following discharge from hospital after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery; however, 21% persisted after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indentified that in this cohort, younger age predicted the expression of an unmet need (AOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>People with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> remained significantly more likely to require more than one contact with the nurse to satisfy a need (AOR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.60-5.01) and to report a physical need (AOR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.03-6.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study has shown that auditing the interactions of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> nurse with patients can provide information about unmet supportive care needs, which can be used to develop relevant supportive care services or interventions for people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
