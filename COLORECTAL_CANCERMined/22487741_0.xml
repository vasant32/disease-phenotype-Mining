<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An effective noninvasive blood test would be an ideal method to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Discovered in 2007 a novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker CCSA-2 showes a promising results in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>THE AIM OF THE STUDY was the evaluation of diagnostic and clinical value of a novel marker - <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> specific antigen-2 (CCSA-2) in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in comparison to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients operated during the years 2008 to 2010 at Wroc≈Çaw Medical University 1st Department and Clinic of General, Gastroenterological and Endocrinologic Surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 40 patients in control group consisted of healthy subjects who had colonoscopy examinations with negative results (no pathology in the colon was found) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The obtained results were statistically analyzed using nonparametric tests - Mann Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine the clinical value of CCSA-2 and CEA in those groups, their sensitivity and specifity was evaluated using ROC analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This analysis determines the accuracy and diagnostic value of both tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between markers in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and a statistically significant relationship according to which respondents with higher concentrations of CCSA-2 also have higher concentrations of CEA (R=0.754, p&lt;0,001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers increase and correlate with the clinical progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of CCSA-2 test using ROC analysis showed a slightly lower measurement of antigen CCSA-2 as diagnostic value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in comparison to measurement of antigen CEA (accuracy of tests: CCSA-2 - 52%, CEA - 60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CCSA-2 as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1298180" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">single tumor</z:e> marker has a low diagnostic value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> because of low sensitivity and specifity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic value of novel marker is slightly lower than previously understood and accepted in clinical practice - CEA </plain></SENT>
