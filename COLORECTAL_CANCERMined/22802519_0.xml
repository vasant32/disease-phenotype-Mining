<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expressions of PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor (HIF)-1α were detected using immunohistochemistry in an independent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cohort of 93 specimens represented on a tissue microarray (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PHD expression levels were correlated with clinicopathological features, patient survival and presumed corresponding HIF-1α expression </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>, 47, 68 and 51 from 93 specimens had low expressions of PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HIF-1α was positively expressed in 75 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low expression of PHD2 correlated with the high-grade group and a terrible overall survival (P = 0.017 and P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
