<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The public has paid attention to green tea due to its health benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">Epigallocatechin-3-gallate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>), the major component of green tea, is well documented to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle arrest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells by targeting multiple signal transduction pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed mechanism(s) of action needs to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cell growth was evaluated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, cell cycle analysis, and caspase 3/7 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein expression was analyzed through Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used for examining <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of p21 and cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The promoter activity of p21 was assessed by the luciferase reporter system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified cyclin D1 and p21 as molecular targets of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed that cyclin D1 was down-regulated, while p21 expression was up-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> in dose- and time-dependent manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> decreased cyclin D1 protein stability, therefore triggering ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> increased p21 promoter activity, resulting in up-regulation of p21 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein, which was likely dependent on extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKK) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3Â K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data presented here details a novel mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> inhibits cell growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Namely, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>-induced cyclin D1 degradation and p21 transcriptional activation partially contribute to growth suppression in these cells </plain></SENT>
