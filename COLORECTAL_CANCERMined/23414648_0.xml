<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">Barium</z:chebi> enema (BE) is widely available for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> despite concerns about its accuracy and acceptability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) might be a more sensitive and acceptable alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare CTC and BE for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in symptomatic patients in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This pragmatic multicentre randomised trial recruited patients with symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from 21 UK hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were aged 55 years or older and regarded by their referring clinician as suitable for radiological investigation of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to BE or CTC by computer-generated random numbers, in blocks of six, stratified by trial centre and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analysed the primary outcome-diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or large (â‰¥10 mm) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>-by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The trial is an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number 95152621 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 3838 patients were randomly assigned to receive either BE (n=2553) or CTC (n=1285) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>34 patients withdrew consent, leaving for analysis 2527 assigned to BE and 1277 assigned to CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was significantly higher in patients assigned to CTC than in those assigned to BE (93 [7.3%] of 1277 vs 141 [5.6%] of 2527, relative risk 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.68; p=0.0390) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CTC missed three of 45 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and BE missed 12 of 85 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rate of additional colonic investigation was higher after CTC than after BE (283 [23.5%] of 1206 CTC patients had additional investigation vs 422 [18.3%] of 2300 BE patients; p=0.0003), due mainly to a higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: CTC is a more sensitive test than BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that CTC should be the preferred radiological test for patients with symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
