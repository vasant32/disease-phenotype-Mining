<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> is administered to improve local control, but can also induce severe anal dysfunction after surgery, while preoperative chemotherapy that significantly reduces the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> has recently been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to examine differences in the effects of preoperative CRT and chemotherapy on tissue degeneration of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 91 patients, including 68 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who underwent internal sphincteric resection with (n = 47, CRT group) or without (n = 21, control group) preoperative CRT, and 23 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who received preoperative FOLFOX treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral nerve degeneration was evaluated histopathologically using H&amp;E-stained sections, based on karyopyknosis, disparity of the nucleus, denucleation, vacuolar or acidophilic degeneration of the cytoplasm, and adventitial neuronal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of neural degeneration was significantly higher in the CRT group than in the control group and FOLFOX group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in any items of neural degeneration between the FOLFOX and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CRT induced marked neural degeneration around the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FOLFOX treatment produced mild neural degeneration similar to that in the control group </plain></SENT>
