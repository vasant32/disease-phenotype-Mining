<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focused on stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA-3), a marker of mesenchymal stem cells and Muse cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of SSEA-3 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines and clinical specimens, specifically the relationship of SSEA-3 expression and the representative <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> markers (CD44, CD166, ALDH, CD24 and CD26) as well as with mesenchymal stem cell/Muse cell marker (CD105) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To characterize SSEA-3-expressing cells, tumorigenicity, sphere formation ability, expression of iPS genes (Oct4, NANOG, SOX2 and c-Myc), cell proliferation and cell cycle status were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SSEA-3 expression was identified in Caco-2, DLD-1, HT-29, SW480 and HCT116, but not in CaR-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship between SSEA-3 and other stem cell markers was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SSEA-3+ cells showed increased tumorigenicity in vivo, but lower sphere formation ability in vitro than SSEA-3- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>iPS gene expression was not correlated with SSEA-3 expression status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SSEA-3+ cells showed higher proliferative ability than SSEA-3- through enhanced cell cycles by decreased expression of p21Cip1/Waf1 and p27Kip1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis in clinical specimens indicated that expression of SSEA-3 is limited to stromal cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa but broad in poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations indicated that SSEA-3+ cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have immature phenotype but decreased self-renewal ability and may function as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> transient amplifying cells or delayed contributing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-initiating cells </plain></SENT>
