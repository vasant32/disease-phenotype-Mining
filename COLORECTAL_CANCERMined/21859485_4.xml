<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This prospective study included 127 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>: 71 undergoing chemotherapy and 56 radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Responsiveness statistics included the Standardized Response Mean (SRM) and the Effect Size (ES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's overall assessment of his/her change in state of health status was the reference criterion to evaluate the responsiveness of the QoL questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 34 patients perceived their health as stable and 17 as improved between the first and the fourth courses of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>21 patients perceived their health as stable and 22 as improved between before and the last week of radiotherapy.The responsiveness of the 3 questionnaires differed according to treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire was more responsive in patients receiving chemotherapy, particulary functional scales (SRM &gt; 0.55) </plain></SENT>
