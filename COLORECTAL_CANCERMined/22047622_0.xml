<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated by comparing incidence rates obtained from the International Agency for Research on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> for 1971-2002 with data on per capita consumption obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations using 10-year delay intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence rates increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> countries except France in men and except Austria, Denmark, England and France in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the dietary variables considered, there were marked increasing trends (linear regression coefficient, R â‰¥0.5) in red meat consumption in Germany (R = 0.9), Austria (R = 0.7), Finland (R = 0.8), Italy (R = 0.9), Poland (R = 0.5), Spain (R = 2.1), Sweden (R = 0.6), and the Netherlands (R = 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in dietary habits may be consistent with the observed trends in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the distinct European countries </plain></SENT>
