<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although chemotherapy-related hepatic injury has been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CRLM) patients, the morphologic changes caused by chemotherapeutic agents and the effect of chemotherapy on postoperative outcome remain ill-defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive review of the morphologic changes in the post-chemotherapy non-neoplastic liver was performed and the clinical effect of preoperative chemotherapy in CRLM patients was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin, Masson's trichrome and reticulin-stained slides from non-neoplastic livers obtained from 89 CRLM patients were analyzed, and the clinicopathologic features were correlated with the status of chemotherapy exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histopathologic features of sinusoidal injury (sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, centrilobular perivenular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, parenchymal extinction lesions, small vessel obliteration, and hepatocyte plate disruption) were significantly more frequent in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-exposed livers (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was positively correlated with increasing numbers of chemotherapy cycles (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal preoperative liver function tests were more frequently seen (p&lt;0.05) and postoperative total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was higher in the chemotherapy group (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative morbidity was more common in the chemotherapy group (p=0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sinusoidal injury is frequently seen in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-treated livers, and its presence, especially when extensive, should be documented in surgical pathology practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recognition of sinusoidal injury may provide helpful guidelines for surgeons in deciding the extent of hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
