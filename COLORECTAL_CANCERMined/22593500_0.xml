<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD57(+) cells include natural killer cells and late stages of T-effector lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between the known clinical and histological factors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers as well as the presence of S100(+) and CD57(+) cells in the tissue of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with the aim of detecting patients at high risk of short overall survival (OS) or short disease-free interval (DFI) after radical surgical treatment and we further analyzed whether S100(+) and CD57(+) positivity could bring on new information regarding the treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 150 patients (97 males and 53 females) that underwent an elective radical surgical procedure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The influence on DFI and on OS of the following parameters was evaluated: grading, staging and positivity for S100 and CD57 by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the relation of preoperative serum levels of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Antigen 72-4 (CA72-4), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">Thymidine</z:chebi> kinase (TK), Tissue-Specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">Polypeptide</z:chebi> Antigen (TPS) and Tissue <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">Polypeptide</z:chebi> Antigen (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) in relation to S100 and CD57 positivity/negativity for the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OS at 1, 3 and 5 years was 92.2%, 76.5% and 70.2%; the DFI at 1, 3 and 5 years was 85.3%, 64.3% and 49.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD57 positivity in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass was proven as a positive prognostic factor for OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk of short OS was 2.5-fold higher in patients with low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltration by CD57(+) lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of N2 stage for lymph nodes and the absence of CD57(+) cells was proven to be the strongest negative prognostic factor for OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant influence of CD57 positivity on DFI appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant influence of S100 positivity on OS or DFI; nor was there any statistical dependence of CD57 and S100 positivity or negativity on preoperative serum levels of CEA, CA19-9, CA72-4, TK, TPS or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both studied factors were shown to be statistically independent factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study showed infiltration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue by CD57(+) cells as being an important independent positive prognostic factor for OS </plain></SENT>
