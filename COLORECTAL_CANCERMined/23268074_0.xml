<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous laparoscopic surgery for gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has many potential advantages, including a small incision, good cosmetic result, less postoperative pain, and less mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some problems have to be resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify the anastomotic problem of combined abdominal minilaparotomy, we present here 2 typical cases of simultaneous laparoscopic surgery for gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 1: The anastomoses after laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and distal gastrectomy were easily performed by combined upper abdominal minilaparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 2: The anastomosis after laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was easily performed by upper abdominal minilaparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the ensuing esophago-jejuno anastomosis after laparoscopic total gastrectomy resulted in failure during combined upper abdominal minilaparotomy because the anastomotic angle was incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the choice of abdominal mini-incision site is crucial during simultaneous laparoscopic surgery for gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgeons should not hesitate to perform an additional mini-incision or change other anastomotic procedures if the operation is difficult, requires a long time to complete, and is likely to cause intraoperative complications </plain></SENT>
