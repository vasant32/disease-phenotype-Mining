<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Review of casuistic related to the use of mechanical suture devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: We studied the casuistic between 2008 and July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More parameters were analyzed compared to cases in which manual suture was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 74 patients benefited from using mechanical suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circular staplers EAEC type were used in 53 cases, TA staplers in 48 cases and Endo GIA in 19 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operations performed were: 44 colo-rectal anastomoses (2 laparoscopic), 9 eso-jejunal anastomoses, 17 gastric resections, 2 duodenal stump closures and 2 rectal stump closures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One (2.56%) colorectal anastomotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was found which led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a single anastomotic imperfection where we performed ileostomy with favorable evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Duration of Dixon's operation was shortened by 36 minutes average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The anastomosis could be lowered to 3 cm from the anal verge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 3 late local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> recurrences, 1 recto-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004320'>vaginal fistula</z:hpo> and 1 rectovesical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no anastomotic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were two main advantages of using mechanical anastomosis: (1) the opportunity of palette broadening of laparoscopic operations, (2) the possibility of making safe anastomosis in difficult to access areas (rectum, esophagus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of mechanical staplers offers advantages especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e>, especially in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> male patients with narrow basin, where we can save many cases from rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Staplers bring more comfort to the surgeon offering physical and psychological feeling of a perfect anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although staplers cost is high, in selected cases, this disadvantage is offset by reducing the duration of operations, hospitalization and subsequent cost of stomas maintenance </plain></SENT>
