<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pentaplex panel is recommended by the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute for MSI testing, but simplified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> panels and immunohistochemistry of mismatch repair proteins are widely employed for convenience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was to evaluate the MSI status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Korean patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study included 1,435 patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> subjected to surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pentaplex Bethesda panel was used for MSI testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy nine (5.5 %) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were classified as MSI-high (MSI-H) and 95 (6.6 %) as MSI-low (MSI-L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BAT-26 and BAT-25 were unstable in 73 and 75 of 79 MSI-H <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the panel comprising these 2 mononucleotide markers, 72 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were diagnosed as MSI-H, compared to the Bethesda panel data (72/79, 91.1 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BAT-26 or BAT-25 were unstable in only 7 (7.4 %) of the 95 MSI-L <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the panel with 2 dinucleotide markers, D17250 linked to p53 and D2S123 to hMSH2, detection rates were 89.9 % (71/79) for MSI-H and 80.0 % (76/95) for MSI-L <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, compared to the Bethesda panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we compared the frequency of MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in our patients with those reported previously from Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the frequency of MSI-H appears lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A simplified panel for MSI testing with BAT-26 and BAT-25 seems not effective for the accurate evaluation of MSI status, particularly in MSI-L colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, in our patients </plain></SENT>
