<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The differential expression of 94 cancer-related miRNAs was examined in DLD-1 and DKO-4 cells (DLD-1 cells with a disrupted oncogenic KRAS) in 3D cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased miR-15b, miR-16, miR-23a, miR-24, miR-103 and miR-222 expression was observed in 3D and in 2D cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of note, increased miR-181a, miR-200c and miR-210 expression was only observed in 3D cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-181a and miR-210 were significantly overexpressed in DLD-1 cells in 3D culture compared with those in HCT116 cells, and were significantly overexpressed in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oncogenic KRAS regulates 3D-specific miRNAs that are possibly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development in vivo </plain></SENT>
