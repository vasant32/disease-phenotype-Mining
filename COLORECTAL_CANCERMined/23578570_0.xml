<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-blocking antibody that has been approved for the treatment of patients with head and neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, but no predictive biomarkers of activity have been yet identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Establishment of such biomarkers will help identify a subset of patients that will benefit from cetuximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this paper, we report on a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e> who had a complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> regression following treatment with cetuximab given as a single agent after initial surgery and radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EGFR protein expression level, the EGFR gene copy number and the EGFR gene sequence were assessed from both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Besides protein overexpression and gene amplification in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue, sequencing of the EGFR gene from the patient revealed the presence of two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>, one in the kinase domain (R705G) and the other in the ligand binding domain (P546S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells that stably express these EGFR mutants were treated with cetuximab and their sensitivity to the drug was compared to cells expressing the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While P546S mutation sensitised NIH-3T3 cells to cetuximab, R705G had a marginal effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The double mutant (P546S/R705G) behaved like the P546S mutant, indicating that the mutation in the kinase domain does not contribute to the increased sensitivity to cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> or B-RAF genes and no HPV protein or DNA was detected in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> in the EGFR ligand binding domain that may contribute to increased sensitivity to cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a role for the P546S mutation in cetuximab sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other factors including EGFR protein high copy number and protein overexpression may have also contributed to the observed response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The severity of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> developed by this patient and its correlation with the antitumour activity does not exclude the involvement of the immune system (i.e. complement-mediated immune response) as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of the P546S mutation needs to be evaluated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e>, as a well as a prospective evaluation of cetuximab anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> activity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> harbouring the mutation </plain></SENT>
