<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We compared colonic methanogenesis in vivo and in vitro as well as fecal pH in healthy subjects and in patients with resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> thus without the possible confounding effects of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 144 subjects, 96 with resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (of whom, 48 were with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>), 48 healthy subjects with intact colon, were analyzed for breath <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi>, fecal methanogenesis in vitro and fecal pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the association between methanogenesis and pH with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site, operation technique and abdominal discomfort was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vivo and in vitro <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> measurements were in agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of breath <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> excretors and fecal pH did not significantly differ in participants resected for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, either with (46%, 6.76) or without (46%, 6.77) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, from healthy participants (40%, 6.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Breath <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> excretors had higher fecal pH than nonexcretors (7.05 versus 6.57, P&lt; 0.001) and less abdominal discomfort (30% versus 54%, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with resected right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 15), there were less breath <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> excretors (20%) than among those with resected left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (51%, n = 81, P = 0.029) as well as lower fecal pH than among those with resected left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (6.27 versus 6.86, P = 0.002) and among healthy subjects (6.80, P = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were as frequently <z:chebi fb="158" ids="16183">methane</z:chebi> producers as healthy subjects with intact colon, and there was no difference in their fecal pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low methanogenesis was found in patients with abdominal discomfort and is a possible characteristic, along with low fecal pH, to right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
