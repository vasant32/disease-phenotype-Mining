<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the methylation status of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes, APC2, p14ARF, and ECAD in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and their association with the mutational status of BRAF and KRAS among Iranian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA from 110 unselected series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients was examined for BRAF V600E mutation by PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation of genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was determined by methylation specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of APC2, E-CAD, and p14 methylation was 92.6%, 40.4% and 16.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But, no V600E mutation was identified in the BRAF gene in any sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was found in cases showing epigenetic APC, ECAD, and p14 abnormality with the clinicopathological parameters under study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between KRAS mutations and the so called methylator phenotype was previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we also analyzed the association between the hot spot KRAS gene mutations in codons of 12 and 13 with genes' promoter hypermethylation in a subset of this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Out of 86 tumors, KRAS was mutated in 24 (28%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the majority occurring in codon 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were not associated with genes' methylation in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a distinct molecular pathway for methylation of APC2, p14, and ECAD genes from those previously described for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> with BRAF or KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
