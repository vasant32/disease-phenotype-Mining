<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of calcium and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Ca/Mg) infusions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two independent authors conducted database searches of the literature to find clinical-controlled trials analyzing Ca/Mg infusions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The keywords used to search were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, neurotoxicity, calcium, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, and peripheral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies that included at least one primary or secondary event were eligible for the analysis, where primary events were incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and cumulative neurotoxicity, and secondary events were the total doses and cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, response rate (RR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and weighted mean differences (MD) were analyzed using models of fixed and random effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This meta-analysis comprised four prospective randomized clinical trials and three retrospective clinical trials involving 1170 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, of which 802 received Ca/Mg infusions (Ca/Mg group) and 368 did not (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, the incidence of grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity in those who received Ca/Mg was significantly lower than that of the control group (OR=0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.11 to 0.62; P=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total rate of cumulative neurotoxicity, and that of grade 3 in particular, was significantly lower in the Ca/Mg group than in the control group (OR=0.42; 95% CI 0.26-0.65; P=0.0001; OR=0.60; 95% CI 0.39-0.92; P=0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in total doses and cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> were also significant between the Ca/Mg and control group (MD=246.73 mg/m2; 95% CI 3.01-490.45; P=0.05; MD=1.55; 95% CI 0.46-2.63; P=0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in median PFS (MD=0.71 month; 95% CI -0.59-2.01; P=0.29), median OS (MD=0.10 month; 95% CI -0.41-0.61; P=0.70) or RRs (OR=0.82; 95% CI 0.61-1.10; P=0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ca/Mg infusions tend to decrease the incidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and cumulative neurotoxicity and thus enhance patients' tolerance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, without significantly altering the efficacy of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
