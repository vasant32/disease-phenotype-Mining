<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our paper is the first analysis, to our knowledge, to deal with such data from the Middle East </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the clinicopathological data of 535 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at our institution between 1983 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 164 patients diagnosed with stage III disease were divided into two categories based on lymph-node ratio (LNR) being the ratio of positive lymph nodes over total lymph nodes dissected: LNR ≤ 0.4 and LNR &gt;0.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the prognostic effect of pLNR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 10-year survival rate for the patients with stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were 76%, 56% and 0% respectively (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using pLNR of 0.4 as the cutoff point was found to yield clinically and significant results, with a significant difference in the outcomes of patients with pLNR ≤ 0.4 compared to those with pLNR &gt;0.4 (hazard ratio = 5.25, 95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 22.1, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ratio-based staging (pLNR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is a more accurate and clinically useful prognostic method than the number of positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> resected or the total number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> retrieved for predicting the course of patients with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
