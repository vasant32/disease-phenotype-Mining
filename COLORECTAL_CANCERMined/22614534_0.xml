<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial protein C is an important regulator of homeostasis and acts through its high affinity binding to its transmembrane receptor (EPCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Soluble (sEPCR) which results from the proteolytic cleavage of the membrane bound form can trap activated endothelial protein C and deprive it of its anti-coagulant function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the expression of EPCR and its soluble form (sEPCR) released into plasma as a result of proteolytic cleavage were investigated in ovarian, breast, lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> biopsies, as well as in ascitic cell clusters and peritoneal fluid from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In parallel, breast, ovarian, lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines were investigated for the expression of EPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The integrity of the EPCR gene sequence as well gene haplotypes were ascertained in the established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines in order to understand their eventual regulatory functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results from the present study indicate that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, the levels of sEPCR are significantly higher than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range compared to healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in the levels of sEPCR parallels the increase in CA125, showing a close correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the detection of sEPCR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and during the post-treatment period could be taken into account as an additional marker that could re-inforce the one obtained using CA125 alone as a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell mass </plain></SENT>
