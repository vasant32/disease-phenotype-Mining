<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Compelling epidemiological evidence indicated that alterations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA), including mutations and abnormal content of mtDNA, were implicated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific manner, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate whether mtDNA content in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) could be used as a risk predictor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mtDNA content was measured by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in PBLs from 320 CRC patients and 320 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients exhibited statistically significantly higher mtDNA content than matched controls (median, 1.03 vs .86; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They further assessed the association between mtDNA content and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using the median value in controls as the cutoff point, they found that, compared with low mtDNA content, high mtDNA content was associated with a significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (adjusted odds ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-2.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a trend analysis, they found a statistically significant dose-response relationship between higher mtDNA content and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (P for trend &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis showed that the association between mtDNA content and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was not modulated by major host characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first epidemiological evidence linking the high mtDNA content in PBLs to elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
