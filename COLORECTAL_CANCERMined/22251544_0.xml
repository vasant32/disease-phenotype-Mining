<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Two hundred twenty eight consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> LMs operated from January 2004 to October 2009 were presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They underwent 137 curative liver resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used extended criteria for respectability including the possibility to spare 2 adjacent liver segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multimodal approaches meaning transformation of primary unresectable LMs to resectable ones were used in 46 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the final decision intraoperative ultrasonography took an important part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The resectability in presented series was 46% for synchronous LM and 76% for metachronous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aggressive surgical approach was applied in 75 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average rate of intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was 300mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications occurred in 25.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rational surgical behavior in context of multimodal approach to LMs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> can increase chances of resectability and long-term survival without influencing morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
