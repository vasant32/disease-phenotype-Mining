<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Exercise benefits patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, but studies of home-based approaches, particularly among those with Stage IV disease, remain small and exploratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To conduct an adequately powered trial of a home-based exercise intervention that can be facilely integrated into established delivery and reimbursement structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-six adults with Stage IV lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomized, in an eight-week trial, to usual care or incremental walking and home-based strength training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exercising participants were instructed during a single physiotherapy visit and subsequently exercised four days or more per week; training and step count goals were advanced during bimonthly telephone calls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was mobility assessed with the Ambulatory Post <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Care BasicÂ Mobility Short Form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included ratings of pain and sleep quality as well as the ability to perform daily activities (Ambulatory Post <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Care Daily Activities Short Form), quality of life (Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-General), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three participants dropped out and seven died (five in the intervention and two in the control group, P=0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At week 8, the intervention group reported improved mobility (P=0.01), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (P=0.02), and sleep quality (P=0.05) compared with the usual care group, but did not differ on the other measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A home-based exercise program seems capable of improving the mobility, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and sleep quality of patients with Stage IV lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
