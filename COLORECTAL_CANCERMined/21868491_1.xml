<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The selection of patients for genetic testing to rule out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> is currently based on fulfilment of at least one of the revised Bethesda criteria followed by mismatch repair (MMR) status analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A study was undertaken to compare the present approach with universal MMR study-based strategies to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> in a large series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2093 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from the EPICOLON I and II cohorts were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins and/or microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis was performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Germline MLH1 and MSH2 mutation analysis was performed in patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> showed loss of MLH1 or MSH2 staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSH6 genetic testing was done in patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> showed lack of MSH6 expression or a combined lack of MSH2 and MSH6 expression but did not have MSH2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PMS2 genetic testing was performed in patients showing isolated loss of PMS2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or not available MMR protein expression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four MMR genes were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 180 patients (8.6%) showed loss of expression of some of the MMR proteins and/or MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and eighty-six patients (23.2%) met some of the revised Bethesda criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 (0.7%) patients who had a MMR gene mutation, 12 fulfilled at least one of the revised Bethesda criteria and two (14.3%) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Routine molecular screening of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> using immunohistochemistry or MSI has better sensitivity for detecting mutation carriers than the Bethesda guidelines </plain></SENT>
