<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The performance of FIT screening can be improved by increasing the screening frequency or by providing more than one sample in each screening round </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate if two-sample FIT screening is cost-effective compared with one-sample FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The MISCAN-colon microsimulation model was used to estimate costs and benefits of strategies with either one or two-sample FIT screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FIT cut-off level varied between 50 and 200 ng <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>/ml, and the screening schedule was varied with respect to age range and interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, different definitions for positivity of the two-sample FIT were considered: at least one positive sample, two positive samples, or the mean of both samples being positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within an exemplary screening strategy, biennial FIT from the age of 55-75 years, one-sample FIT provided 76.0-97.0 life-years gained (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>) per 1000 individuals, at a cost of €259 000-264 000 (range reflects different FIT cut-off levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-sample FIT screening with at least one sample being positive provided 7.3-12.4 additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> compared with one-sample FIT at an extra cost of €50 000-59 000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screening intervals and age ranges were considered, intensifying screening with one-sample FIT provided equal or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> at lower costs compared with two-sample FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If attendance to screening does not differ between strategies it is recommended to increase the number of screening rounds with one-sample FIT screening, before considering increasing the number of FIT samples provided per screening round </plain></SENT>
