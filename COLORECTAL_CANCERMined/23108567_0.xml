<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the hotspot clustered mutations in codons 12 and 13 is compulsory before therapy and no standardized methodology for that purpose has been established so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since these mutations may have different biological effects and clinical outcome, reliable frequency and types of KRAS mutations need to be determined for individual therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this study was to describe the KRAS mutation spectrum in a group of 481 Serbian mCRC patients and to compare the general performances of allele-specific PCR and reverse-hybridization assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: KRAS testing was performed with two diagnostic analyses, DxS TheraScreen K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> PCR Kit and KRAS StripAssay™ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 were present in 37.6 % of analyzed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The seven most frequent mutation types were observed with both assays: p.G12D 34.6 %, p.G12V 24.9 %, p.G12A 10.3 %, p.G12C 8.1 %, p.G12S 5.4 %, p.G12R 1.6 %, and p.G13D 15.1 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding double mutants, 0.8 % of them were present among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested samples and 2.2 % among KRAS mutated ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two screening approaches that were used in this study have been shown as suitable tests for detecting KRAS mutations in diagnostic settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, they appear to be good alternatives to methods presently in use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our experience, both methods showed capacity to detect and identify double mutations which may be important for potential further subgrouping of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
