<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed growth activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> resected at first and second hepatectomy by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in 21 patients undergoing 2-stage hepatectomy to justify the 2-stage approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 24 patients planned to undergo 2-stage hepatectomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, 21 had completion of both stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although maximum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and serum carcinoembryonic antigen before and after the first procedure did not differ, volume of the future liver remnant increased after the first procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen positivity rates were comparable between initially and subsequently resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P = .09 and P = .83, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) in initially versus subsequently resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> for cyclin D1 (4.27 ± 1.29 vs 6.52 ± 2.23; P = .90), cyclin E1 (24.18 ± 16.81 vs 10.53 ± 2.28; P = .60), hepatocyte growth factor (3.16 ± 1.42 vs 0.58 ± 0.15; P = .11), basic fibroblast growth factor (5.42 ± 1.54 vs 5.92 ± 3.33; P = .13), epidermal growth factor (19.56 ± 14.76 vs 9.07 ± 4.54; P = .74), and transforming growth factor-α (2.63 ± 1.02 vs 2.07 ± 1.15; P = .29) showed no differences between the 2 time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Two-stage hepatectomy did not seem to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> activity or growth factor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2-stage strategy in combination with effective preoperative chemotherapy is a valuable strategy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
