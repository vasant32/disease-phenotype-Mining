<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their fate is regulated stochastically by populational asymmetry, yet whether asymmetrical fate as a mode of SC division is relevant and whether the SC niche contains committed progenitors of the specialized cell types are under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate spindle alignments and planar cell polarities, which form a novel functional unit that, in SCs, can yield daughter cell anisotropic movement away from niche-supporting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that this contributes to SC homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we demonstrate that some SC divisions are asymmetric with respect to cell fate and provide data suggesting that, in some SCs, mNumb displays asymmetric segregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of these processes were altered in apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> crypts and microadenomas of mice carrying germline Apc mutations, shedding new light on the first stages of progression toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
