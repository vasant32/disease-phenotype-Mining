<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic resection is used widely in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; however, the data on long-term outcomes, particularly those related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of long-term follow-up of the UK Medical Research Council trial of laparoscopically assisted versus open surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 794 patients from 27 UK centres were randomized to laparoscopic or open surgery in a 2:1 ratio between 1996 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up data were analysed to determine differences in survival outcomes and recurrences for intention-to-treat and actual treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 62·9 (interquartile range 22·9 - 92·8) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between open and laparoscopic groups in overall survival (78·3 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 65·8 to 106·6) versus 82·7 (69·1 to 94·8) months respectively; P = 0·780) and disease-free survival (DFS) (89·5 (67·1 to 121·7) versus 77·0 (63·3 to 94·0) months; P = 0·589) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> intraoperative conversions to open surgery were associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 2·28, 95 per cent c.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1·47 to 3·53; P &lt; 0·001) and DFS (HR 2·20, 1·31 to 3·67; P = 0·007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In terms of recurrence, no significant differences were observed by randomized procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, at 10 years, right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancers</z:e> showed an increased propensity for local recurrence compared with left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancers</z:e>: 14·7 versus 5·2 per cent (difference 9·5 (95 per cent c.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>2·3 to 16·6) per cent; P = 0·019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term results continue to support the use of laparoscopic surgery for both colonic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
