<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EGFR pathway has been shown to be activated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (GC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, published data on KRAS and BRAF mutation status is limited in GC and has not been compared between GC from different geographic regions.Methods:The prevalence of KRAS and BRAF mutations was established in 712 GC: 278 GC from the United Kingdom, 230 GC from Japan and 204 GC from Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between KRAS/BRAF mutation status, DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status, clinicopathological variables and overall survival was analysed.Results:Overall, 30 (4.2%) GC carried a KRAS mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 5.8% of the UK GC, 4% of Japan GC and 1.5% of Singapore GC were KRAS mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutant GC had fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> in the UK cohort (P=0.005) and were more frequent in elderly patients in the Japan cohort (P=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were more frequent in MMR-deficient GC in the UK and the Japanese cohort (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A BRAF mutation was only detected in a single Japanese GC.Conclusions:This large multicentre study demonstrated that KRAS mutations and DNA MMR deficiency have a role in a small subgroup of GC irrespective of country of origin, suggesting that this subgroup of GC may have developed along a common pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies need to establish whether concomitant mutations or amplifications of other EGFR signalling pathway genes may contribute to the activation of this pathway in GC.British Journal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> advance online publication, 19 March 2013; advance online publication, 19 March 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.109 www.bjcancer.com </plain></SENT>
