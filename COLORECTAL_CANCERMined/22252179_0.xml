<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was extracted from 25 mg of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue (n = 70) that were taken from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> mass and pairs with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelial tissue distant from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exon 1 and exon 2 of the K-ras gene were amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hotspot mutations were detected using polymerase chain reaction-based single-strand conformation polymorphism method and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 14 out of the 70 (20%) colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single-base transition from GGT to GAT (glycine to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>) in codon 12 was detected in nine samples, while three samples presented with GGC to GAC transition in codon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> had a 12-fold higher likelihood of K-ras mutations (odds ratios [OR] 12.31; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.81-83.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> located at the left colon were more likely to present with K-ras mutations (OR 4.54; 95% CI 0.96-21.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high frequency of G to A transition of codon 12 mutation of the K-ras gene, with significant correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
