<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative gene regulators acting at the 3'UTR level, modulating the translation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 3'UTRs could impact the miRNA-dependent gene regulation either by weakening or by reinforcing the binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the alteration of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> regulation of a given gene could affect the individual's risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is helpful to develop a tool enabling the researchers to predict which of the many SNPs could really impact the regulation of a target gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At present, there are several available databases and algorithms able to predict potential binding sites in the 3'UTR of genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, each algorithm gives different predictions and none of them gives, for each polymorphism, a direct measurement of the biological impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose an approach allowing the assignment to each polymorphism a ranking of its biological impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method is based on a simple elaboration of predictions from preexisting well-established algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As an example, we show the application of this approach to 140 genes candidate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These genes were identified following a genome-wide sequencing of 20,857 transcripts from 18,191 genes in 11 CRC specimens and were found somatically mutated and thought to be crucial for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
