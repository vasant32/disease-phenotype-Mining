<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Screening Demonstration Program (CRCSDP) in 2005 to explore the feasibility of establishing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening program for underserved US populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We provide a detailed overview of the evaluation and an assessment of the costs incurred during the service delivery (screening) phase of the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tailored cost questionnaires were completed by staff at the five CRCSDP sites for the first 2 years of the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected cost data for clinical and programmatic activities (program management, data collection and tracking, etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also measured in-kind contributions and assigned values to them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first 2 years of the demonstration excluding the start-up cost, the average cost per person was $2569 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Per person cost of clinical services alone ranged from $264 to $1385, while per person programmatic costs ranged from $545 to $3017 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programs can incur substantial costs for some non-clinical activities, such as data collection/tracking, and these support activities should be managed carefully to control costs and ensure successful program implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight the importance of performing economic evaluation to guide the design of future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programs </plain></SENT>
