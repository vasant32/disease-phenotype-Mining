<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the possible predictive value of the VEGF-A SNPs, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 72 patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood, and SNPs were analyzed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNPs were correlated with response and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haplotypes were estimated using the PHASE program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response was observed in 21% of the patients with the -2578 CA genotype compared with 59% of the patients with CC+AA, P=0.002, in 26% of the patients with the -460 CT genotype compared with 57% with CC+TT, P=0.01, and in 27% of the patients with the +405 GC genotype compared with 54% with GG+CC, P=0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs were significantly related to PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A haplotype with a significant relationship to response was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated obvious relationships between genetic variations in the VEGF-A gene and response to first-line XELOX in patients with mCRC, which translated to a significant difference in PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results call for validation in a larger cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
