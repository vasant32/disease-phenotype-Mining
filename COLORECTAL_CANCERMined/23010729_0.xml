<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews the success, complications, and functional results after various methods of vaginal reconstruction following resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed by using the MEDLINE database, Embase, and the Cochrane library (1990-2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen papers were available to review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women who received a neovagina following vaginectomy returned to sexual activity postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rectus abdominis myocutaneous (RAM) flap remains the most common method of vaginal reconstruction after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Advantages include low operative morbidity, a wide arc of rotation, and ease of harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternatives to flap reconstruction of the vagina have limited indications because of higher morbidity rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preferred techniques for vaginal reconstruction following vaginectomy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection include RAM flaps for partial posterior vaginal defects and bilateral Gracilis myocutaneous flaps for complete vaginal excisions </plain></SENT>
