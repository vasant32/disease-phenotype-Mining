<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(BP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total phenolic and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> contents of the extracts were determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties of different polarity fractions extracted from BP were evaluated using DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging test and FRAP assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27750">ethyl acetate</z:chebi> fraction (EE-BP) showed the highest <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity compared to other fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the anti-proliferative activities of the extracts on four human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, namely MCF-7, HepG2, MGC 803 and RKO, were investigated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EE-BP displayed the most remarkable anti-proliferative effect against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, particularly RKO cell in dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activities and cytotoxicity correlated highly with the total phenolic and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> contents, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, The active ingredient BP-6, namely 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3,3'-dimethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5078">flavonol</z:chebi>, was isolated and purified with the purity above 99.00% and content of 0.15% in EE-BP detected by HPLC, which could significantly inhibit the proliferation of RKO cells with the IC(50) value of 6.66 μmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In order to characterize the apoptotic RKO cells, flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assay were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic cell numbers increased in a dose-dependent manner after the treatment with different concentrations of EE-BP and BP-6 for 12 and 6 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DNA ladders in apoptotic RKO cells could be easily visualized when exposed to 200 μg/ml of the EE-BP for 36 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our work indicated that BP had potentially therapeutic value against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
