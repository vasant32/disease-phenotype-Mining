<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> consecutively treated with (90)Y radioembolization underwent triphasic MDCT of the liver at baseline and 1 and 3 months after treatment and FDG PET at baseline and 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Percentage change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> attenuation at MDCT (volumetric attenuation), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size at MDCT (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> [RECIST] and World health Organization [WHO] criteria), and volume-weighted maximum standardized uptake value at FDG PET were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between FDG PET response 3 months after treatment and response according to RECIST, WHO criteria, and attenuation 1 month after treatment was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 13.3% of patients with FDG PET findings of response 3 months after treatment were identified according to RECIST and WHO criteria 1 month after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to attenuation criteria at 1 month, however, 53.3% of patients with an FDG PET response at 3 months were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strong association was found between FDG PET response at 3 months and response based on attenuation criteria (odds ratio, 12.4; 95% CI, 0.58-265.3; p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early changes in the attenuation of liver metastatic lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> after (90)Y radioembolization treatment may be predictive of future response at FDG PET </plain></SENT>
