<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a technique for isolation and solubilization of intermediate filament (IF) proteins from colonic biopsies compatible with both gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography "shotgun" proteomics using mass spectrometry (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is important because changes in the IF proteome, particularly in keratin expression and modification, are noted in colonic mucosa of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Though keratins have traditionally been dissolved in high concentration of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>, the latter solvent precludes efficient proteolytic digestion by trypsin prior to gel-free LC-MS/MS approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extraction of cytoskeletal proteins was initially evaluated using MCF-7 cancer cell lines using a published, differential detergent solubilization protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IF proteins were extracted from colonic biopsies using a combination of homogenization and sonication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since comparable efficiency of solubilization was noted on the extracted IF from cell lines between <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42820">guanidine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (GuHCl) in triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer, isolated proteins from endoscopic biopsies were solubilized in GuHCl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using immunoblotting techniques, we successfully demonstrated isolation of keratins and preservation of posttranslational modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dissolved proteins were tryptically digested and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> analyzed by MS, showing the functionality of the workflow in shotgun proteomic applications, specifically compatibility of the workflow for isobaric tagging relative and absolute quantification based quantitation approaches </plain></SENT>
