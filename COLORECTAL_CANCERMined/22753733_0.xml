<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of DB, on human HT-29 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: DB was isolated and characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay was used to assess the effects of DB on HT-29 cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anticancer effects of DB were investigated in a murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant inhibition of cell viability was observed with DB treatment in time- and dose-dependent manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DB administered subcutaneously daily at 0.6-15 mg/kg was proven to be safe and effective in inhibiting the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of Bax, cleaved poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase and active caspase-3 were observed with DB treatment and the increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volumes of treated groups were significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower than those of the mock-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DB has potential as a new therapeutic agent against human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
