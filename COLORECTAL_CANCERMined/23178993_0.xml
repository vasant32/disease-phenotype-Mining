<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Surveillance colonoscopy is undertaken after resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to detect and treat local recurrence and metachronous lesions, with the aim of improving survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to clarify the current timing of surveillance colonoscopies and evaluate the rates of local recurrence and metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 459 patients who underwent surveillance colonoscopy at our institution after curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number and timing of surveillance colonoscopies, incidence of local recurrence and metachronous lesions, pathological findings of lesions, treatment of lesions, and outcomes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first surveillance colonoscopy was undertaken at 6-18 months after surgery in 73 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence was detected in three cases (0.7 %), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> during the first surveillance colonoscopy, which was performed &gt;1 year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These three patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent additional surgery and were alive 5 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Invasive metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were detected in six patients (1.3 %) at 18-57 months after surgery, and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Considering the low incidence of postoperative lesions and the timing of lesion detection, reducing the number of surveillance colonoscopies after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may be appropriate </plain></SENT>
