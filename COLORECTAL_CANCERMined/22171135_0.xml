<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cell survival percentage was examined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (Moto-nuclear cell direc cytotoxicity) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SOX7 expression was assessed by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SB203580 was used to inhibit the p38MAPK signal pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SOX7 promoter activity was detected by Luciferase reporter assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SOX7 was upregulated by aspirin and was involved in aspirin-mediated growth inhibition of SW480 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The p38MAPK pathway played a role in aspirin-induced SOX7 expression, during which the AP1 transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos upregulated SOX7 promoter activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SOX7 is upregulated by aspirin and is involved in aspirin-mediated growth inhibition of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
