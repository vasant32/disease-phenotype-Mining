<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: Thirty-nine patients had undergone a dual-time-point PET/CT scan and a subsequent histopathological confirmation for a workup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection rates were compared for visual analysis score, standardized uptake value (SUV), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-to-liver uptake ratio (TLR), and percent changes of the SUV and TLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 91 liver lesions, 86 lesions were confirmed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SUV and TLR of metastatic lesions on the delayed images were higher than those on the first scan (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signal-to-noise ratio of the delayed PET scan was higher than that of the first scan (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TLR and SUV of the delayed scan showed the highest detection rates of 92% and 88%, whereas percent changes of SUV and TLR showed the lowest detection rates (51%, 67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual analysis detected 87% on the delayed scan and 77% on the first scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A delayed scan is more favorable for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and the TLR on the delayed scan was the most useful parameter </plain></SENT>
