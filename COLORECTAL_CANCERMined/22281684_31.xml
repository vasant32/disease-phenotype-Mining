<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients harbouring the same BRAF(V600E) oncogenic lesion have poor prognosis and show only a very limited response to this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the cause of the limited therapeutic effect of PLX4032 in BRAF(V600E) mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumours</z:e>, here we performed an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-interference-based genetic screen in human cells to search for kinases whose knockdown synergizes with BRAF(V600E) inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) shows strong synergy with BRAF(V600E) inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find in multiple BRAF(V600E) mutant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> that inhibition of EGFR by the antibody drug cetuximab or the small-molecule drugs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> is strongly synergistic with BRAF(V600E) inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, we find that BRAF(V600E) inhibition causes a rapid feedback activation of EGFR, which supports continued proliferation in the presence of BRAF(V600E) inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>Melanoma</z:hpo> cells express low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this feedback activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, we find that ectopic expression of EGFR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cells is sufficient to cause resistance to PLX4032 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that BRAF(V600E) mutant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> (approximately 8-10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>), for which there are currently no targeted treatment options available, might benefit from combination therapy consisting of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors </plain></SENT>
