<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the platelet and the biological features in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The correlation of platelet counts of 150 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with their clinicopathological characteristics was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the survival impact of preoperative platelet count was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations between the platelet count and the lymph node and distance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p=0.016 and 0.014), vascular and perinural invasion (p=0.025 and 0.016) as well as TNM clinical stages (p=0.014) except for the age, gender and grades (p=0.245, 0.276 and 0.324, respectively) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 5-year survival of patients with high platelet count and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet count were 13.30% and 56.30%, respectively (p=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, concurrent with lymph node and distance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, perinural invasion and clinical stages (p=0.000, 0.022, 0.034 and 0.000), platelet count (p=0.010) was also found to be an independent prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in our study through multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated platelet might play some role in the progress of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and preoperative platelet count might be a prognostic indicator in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
