<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Initial studies have investigated the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) using C-reactive protein (CRP) as a proinflammatory biomarker and have noted inconsistent results among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here report the findings from a large prospective study with repeat measurements of CRP, as well as serum amyloid A (SAA), an additional biomarker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, we examined associations of CRP and SAA with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using repeat assessments (baseline and 3-year follow-up) among 953 matched case-control pairs for CRP and 966 pairs for SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate-adjusted conditional-logistic regression models were used with two-sided tests of significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis assessed their utility as early detection markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon cancer</z:hpo> risk (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence intervals) among women in the highest quintiles of CRP or SAA compared to those in the lowest quintiles was ORcolon/CRP = 1.37 (0.95-1.97, p-trend = 0.04) and ORcolon/SAA = 1.26 (0.88-1.80, p-trend = 0.10), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women with elevated concentrations of both CRP and SAA had an increased risk of ORcolon = 1.50 (1.12-2.00, p-value = 0.006) compared to those with low concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No positive associations were observed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and weaker associations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Temporal changes in biomarkers more than 3 years did not predict risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The area under the 6-month ROC curve for CRP+SAA was 0.62 (95% confidence interval = 0.55-0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated inflammatory biomarkers are associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, changes in the biomarkers over time do not suggest that they merit consideration as early detection markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
