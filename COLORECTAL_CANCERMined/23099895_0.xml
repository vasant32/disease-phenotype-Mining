<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The importance of how to treat CRLM has attracted attention from doctors world wide and specific academic organization and expect consensus has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative principals of treatment of CRLM also developed in China, for example, guideline of diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>(draft) and standard for diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, which were established in 2008 and 2010, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, we found that the Chinese doctors still understand these treatment policies inadequately, and easily produce deviation on the treatment progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the problems of current CRLM treatment, we have some thoughts or suggestions as follows: (1)Promoting the core conception of CRLM treatment actively: surgery is the only method to achieve possible cure of the CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) Evaluating the status of new adjuvant chemotherapy for CRLM dialectically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3)Paying attention to multi-disciplinary team(MDT): MDT is the scientific treatment foundation of CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(4)Changing the treatment conception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> of CRLM: radical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> is essential for the resectable CRLM.(5)Emphasizing the surgical treatment of CRLM combined with lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(6)Do not neglect the safety of patients, when we emphasize the surgery is the optimal treatment of CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These guides of treatment of CRLM will improve the outcomes of CRLM around the world, but we still need pay attention to above mentioned points in order to insure the standardization and scientification of CRLM therapy </plain></SENT>
