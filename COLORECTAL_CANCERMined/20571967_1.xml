<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This epigenetic alteration affects promoter of genes having crucial cellular functions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor, DNA repair, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the methylation status in the promoter regions of the RARβ2, RASSF1A, DAPKinase, and CDH1 genes in 73 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 43 paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues of Tunisian patients using methylation-specific PCR assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between methylation status and the clinicopathological features was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether aberrant methylation affects gene expression, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis for E-cadherin and COX-2, a target gene of RAR��2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methylation frequencies vary from 80.8% for RARβ2 to 35.6% for RASSF1A while in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-paired samples; the frequencies of methylation are significantly lower for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the fourth genes tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The methylation status did not correlate with any of the clinical features considered; however, aberrant methylation of RARβ2 was associated with a shortened overall patients' survival (p log rank = 0.026); nevertheless, it needs to be confirmed on larger sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significant inverse association was observed between methylation status of RARβ2 and COX-2 protein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimen (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we found that loss of E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with aberrant methylation of the CDH1 promoter (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings showed that RARβ2 was frequently methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and correlated with a worse prognosis and high expression of COX-2 suggesting a link between these two proteins in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also showed that epigenetic alteration of CDH1 is a major mechanism of the loss of E-cadherin protein expression in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
