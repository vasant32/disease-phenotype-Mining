<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The current study was designed to identify prognostic factors for long-term survival in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a consecutive cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 123 patients were operated because of T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2008 in the Clinic of Surgery, UK-SH Campus Luebeck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 78 patients underwent a multivisceral resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The postoperative morbidity was elevated in the patient group with multivisceral resections (34.6% vs. 26.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we detected no significant differences concerning 30 days mortality (7.7% vs. 8.9%; p = 0.815) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main prognostic factor that reached significance in the multivariate analysis was the possibility to obtain a R0 resection (p &lt; 0.0001) resulting in a 5-year survival rate of 55% for patients with curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in 5-year survival between multivisceral and non-multivisceral resections (p = 0.608) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also we were not able to detect any significant differences for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of colonic or rectal origin (p = 0.839), for laparoscopic vs. open procedures (p = 0.610), and for emergency vs. planned operations (p = 0.674) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> was not a predictive factor concerning survival as there was no difference between patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> (p = 0.658) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multivisceral resections are associated with the same 5-year survival as standard resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim to perform a R0 resection should always be the main goal in surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In planned operations, a laparoscopic approach is justified in selected patients </plain></SENT>
