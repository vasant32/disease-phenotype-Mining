<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, existing research tends to aggregate AAPIs as one group when reporting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, masking the disproportionate burden in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening that exists across AAPI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study examines differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates in both aggregated and disaggregated AAPI groups as compared with non-Latino Whites in order to identify the most vulnerable AAPI subgroups in terms of obtaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study utilizes merged data from the 2001, 2003, and 2005 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), specifically the data pertaining to adults aged 50 and older (n = 52,491) from seven AAPI groups (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, South Asian, Vietnamese, and Pacific Islander) and non-Latino Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017923" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Andersen</z:e>'s Behavioral Model of Health Services Use was utilized to select potential confounders to racial/ethnic differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When AAPI groups were considered as an aggregate, their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rate (46.8%) was lower than that of non-Latino Whites (57.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When AAPI groups were disaggregated, further disparity was noted: Koreans (32.7%) showed the lowest <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rate, whereas Japanese (59.8%) had the highest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the influence of potential predisposing, enabling, and need confounders was adjusted, Koreans, Filipinos, and South Asians were found to have a lower likelihood than non-Latino Whites to undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparisons among AAPI subgroups further revealed that Filipinos, Koreans, Pacific Islanders, and South Asians were less likely than Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese to receive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of identifying differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening behavior among disaggregated AAPI subgroups in order to help health professionals and policy-makers prioritize which AAPI subgroups need the most urgent interventions in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening promotion </plain></SENT>
