<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the incidence of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI) status and loss of the DNA repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and MGMT in a series of 89 SAC, 81 matched conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (CC) and 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> showing histological and molecular features of high-level MSI (sMSI-H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that KRAS are more prevalent than BRAF mutations in SAC (42.7% vs. 25.8%; p = 0.011) being the KRAS-mutated cases even more abundant in SAC displaying adjacent serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G12D and E545K are the most common KRAS and PIK3CA mutations found in SAC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAC show higher frequency of MGMT loss compared to CC (50.6% vs. 25.3%; p = 0.001) especially in distal colon/rectum (60.0% vs. 21.6%; p = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SAC differ from sMSI-H in terms of KRAS and BRAF mutation prevalence, MSI status and MLH1 expression (p = 0.0003, p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SACs are more often KRAS-mutated and microsatellite stable and display different molecular and immunohistochemical characteristics compared to CC and sMSI-H </plain></SENT>
