<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: With rapid growth in the elderly population, the number of elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who should be offered life-prolonging radical surgery has been increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this report is to demonstrate the outcome of elective radical surgery for gastric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients 80 years of age or older, including the natural course of recovery of functional independence, in order to avoid the negative attitude held toward surgery that is due only to patients' high chronological age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Physical condition, ADL, and QOL of 108 patients 80 years of age or older with gastric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were evaluated preoperatively and at the 1st, 3rd, and 6th postoperative months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and the morbidity rate was 27.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 6% of the patients showed a decrease in ADL at the 6th postoperative month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This decrease typically occurred following discharge from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient QOL showed recovery to an extent equal to or better than average preoperative scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Of the patients who underwent elective surgery for gastric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, only a few showed a protracted decline in ADL, and most exhibited better QOL after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment should therefore be considered, whenever needed, for elderly patients 80 years of age or older with gastric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
