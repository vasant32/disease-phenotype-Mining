<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has been constant speculation about the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi>; however, the published results are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study are to conduct a systematic search, and assess the literature to determine the available evidence on the association between these two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Meta-analysis was conducted based on relevant studies identified through a systematic literature review from PubMed, OvidSP, and Cochrane database during January 1980 to July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combined analysis was performed, followed by a subgroup analyses stratified by the study design, type of colorectal lesions, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Publication bias was assessed using the Begg and Egger tests and visual inspection of funnel plot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, MetS was associated with 34% increase in the risk of CN [summary relative risk (RR), 1.34; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24-1.44] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between MetS and CN was found to be statistically significant in separate analysis for both case-control studies (summary RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.44-1.73) and cohort studies (summary RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.13-1.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association remained significant when analyses were restricted by type of colorectal lesions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>: RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.18-1.43; colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>: RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.26-1.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further subgroup analysis by sex showed significant association between MetS and CN in both male and female population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed significant association between presence of MetS and CN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results may help in identifying high-risk individuals at early stage, who might benefit from targeted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening intervention </plain></SENT>
