<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three patients received 9 mg/kg of panitumumab followed by 350 mg/m(2) of irinotecan every 21 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age of patients included was 67 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had previously received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, 84 % <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and 8 % irinotecan as first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received a median of five infusions of panitumumab and irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On an intention-to-treat analysis, 12 patients (23 %) achieved partial responses and 22 patients (41 %) achieved disease stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.5 and 15.1 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent treatment-related severe toxicities per patient were diarrhoea (35.8 %), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> (32.1 %), asthenia (18.9 %) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (13.2 %) </plain></SENT>
