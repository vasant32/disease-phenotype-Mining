<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to identify plasma microRNAs for preliminarily screening <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in general population, so that some unnecessary colonoscopies can be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated plasma microRNA expression in 3 independent cohorts including the discovery (n=80), training (n=112) and validation (n=49) phases recruited at 2 medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microarrays were used for screening 723 microRNAs in 80 plasma samples to identify candidate microRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR was performed on the 161 training and validation plasma samples to evaluate the candidate microRNAs discovered from microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression model was constructed based on the training cohort and then verified by using the validation dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified a panel of miR-409-3p, miR-7 and miR-93 that yielded high diagnostic accuracy in discriminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from healthy group (AUC 0.866 and 0.897 for training and validation dataset, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study reveals a plasma microRNA panel that has potential clinical value in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection and would play a critical role on preliminarily screening <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in general population.
