<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Qualitative study using individual interviews in Adelaide, South Australia, between July 2009 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were recruited from five culturally distinct groups in SA (Greek, Vietnamese, Iranian, Indigenous and Anglo-Australian) and included people who had participated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and people who had not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors that may act as barriers to or enablers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We interviewed 121 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Members of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups expressed positive attitudes towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we also noted a lack of knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> and its screening tests across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, and that the tests were viewed as unpleasant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Issues that differed across groups included language barriers, fatalistic views about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, embarrassment, the importance of privacy, the significance of a doctor's recommendation, moral obligations, and culture-specific concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that population-based screening programs may need to be modified to facilitate access and participation among minority populations and Indigenous people if equity in screening is to be achieved </plain></SENT>
