<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our recent work, which revealed decreased expression of Cyclin A2 upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, suggests a more complicated situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, we identified a role for Cyclin A2, via RhoA, in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the control of cell invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cyclin A2 also regulates spindle orientation which, when misoriented, could disrupt cell polarity and favor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell detachment from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> as part of a transforming process, such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During EMT, cells undergo morphological and molecular changes toward a mesenchymal phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upregulation, or increased activity of some Rho GTPases, such as Cdc42, Rac1 or RhoC, increases the invasive potential of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This correlates with the inverse relationship between RhoA and RhoC activities we observed in an epithelial cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these observations raise the possibility that Cyclin A2 is instrumental in preventing EMT and therefore <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of epithelial tissues </plain></SENT>
