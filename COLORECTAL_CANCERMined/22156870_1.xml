<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of intraoperative colonic irrigation with a Y-shaped irrigation device and intraoperative colonoscopy in the management of obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in patients undergoing elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing surgical treatment at a single tertiary care institution in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: Among 715 consecutive patients with left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 101 patients (14.1%) with obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> received intraoperative colonic irrigation and intraoperative colonoscopy before colectomy and primary anastomosis, and 614 patients with nonobstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> underwent preoperative colonoscopy with mechanical bowel preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection rates of proximal synchronous lesions, occurrence of postoperative complications, and changes in the surgical procedure prompted by the results of the intraoperative colonoscopy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraoperative colonoscopy detected synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in 27 patients (26.8%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 4 patients (4%), and obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in 2 patients (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings of the intraoperative colonoscopy prompted changes in surgical procedure in 9 patients (8.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall morbidity in the intraoperative group was 17%, with anastomotic leakages in 3 patients, wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 5, and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of these complications was not increased in patients with intraoperative colonoscopy with intraoperative colonic irrigation compared with those receiving preoperative colonoscopy with mechanical bowel preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operation time was 28 minutes longer in the intraoperative than in the preoperative group, but neither the time to start of oral intake nor the length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The study is limited by its retrospective nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : In patients with obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, intraoperative colonic irrigation with intraoperative colonoscopy is a useful strategy for detecting synchronous lesions located proximally to the obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, without increasing patient morbidity </plain></SENT>
