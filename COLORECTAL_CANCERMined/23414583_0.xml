<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopies performed in patients aged 50-74 for a positive guaiac-based faecal occult blood test between September 2003 and February 2010 within the screening programme in progress in Alsace (France) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 10,277 colonoscopies, 250 adverse events were recorded, 48 (4.7‰, 95% CI 3.4-6.0) of them being moderate or severe, mainly 10 (1.0‰, 95% CI 0.4-1.6) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> and 31 (3.0‰, 95% CI 2.0-4.1) <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>91.7% of moderate and severe adverse events were the result of a therapeutic procedure </plain></SENT>
