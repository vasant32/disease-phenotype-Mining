<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of different reaction time, temperature, pH value, ligand concentration and the molar ratio of GSH/<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were carefully investigated to optimize the synthesis condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optical properties of as-prepared CdTe QDs were studied by UV-visible absorption spectrum and fluorescence spectrum, meanwhile their structure and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were characterized using transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the CdTe QDs that are single-capped with either GSH or <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, the GSH-<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> co-capped CdTe QDs demonstrated significantly improved fluorescence intensity and optical stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, GSH-<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> co-capped CdTe QDs were conjugated to amonoclonal antibody ND-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GSH-<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> co-capped CdTe QDs-antibody probe was successfully used to label <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, CCL187, in vitro </plain></SENT>
