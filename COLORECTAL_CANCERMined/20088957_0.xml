<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study outlines the important characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> detected by pilot screening and compares the location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> with those of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> to challenge the circumstantial evidence for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The first 100 patients with screen-detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> from University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) were identified from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Important characteristics of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were identified from the endoscopy reporting system and entered into a database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyp</z:mpath> location was compared with the location of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> detected in the UHCW <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred patients were selected for investigation and 202 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was 61 years, 35% were under the age of 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 67% male subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average size of the largest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> in each of the different patients was 13.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five per cent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histology was available for 181 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of which 40% were tubulovillous, 33% tubular, 14% metaplastic and 1% villous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight per cent showed low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 8% high-grade one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The location of screen-detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was significantly different from that of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in our database, with proportionally more sigmoid and proportionally less rectal and caecal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study outlines the important characteristics of screen-detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The significant difference in location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> from that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> suggests a variation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> potential of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> depending on the location </plain></SENT>
