<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Computer-aided detection (CAD) for CT colonography (CTC) has been developed to detect benign <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether such a CAD system can also detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CTC data from 137 symptomatic patients subsequently proven to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were analysed by a CAD system at 4 different sphericity settings: 0, 50, 75 and 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CAD prompts were classified by an observer as either true-positive if overlapping a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or false-positive if elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic data were used to aid matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 137 cancers, CAD identified 124 (90.5%), 122 (89.1%), 119 (86.9%) and 102 (74.5%) at a sphericity of 0, 50, 75 and 100, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A substantial proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were detected on either the prone or supine acquisition alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 125 patients with prone and supine acquisitions, 39.3%, 38.3%, 43.2% and 50.5% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were detected on a single acquisition at a sphericity of 0, 50, 75 and 100, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CAD detected three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> missed by radiologists at the original clinical interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>False-positive prompts decreased with increasing sphericity value (median 65, 57, 45, 24 per patient at values of 0, 50, 75, 100, respectively) but many patients were poorly prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAD can detect symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> but must be applied to both prone and supine acquisitions for best performance </plain></SENT>
