<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Many Medicare enrollees do not receive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tests at recommended intervals despite having Medicare screening coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the physician visits of Medicare enrollees who are untested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study objective was to evaluate physician visits of enrollees who lack appropriate testing to identify opportunities to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used North Carolina and South Carolina Medicare data to compare type and frequency of physician visits for Medicare enrollees with and without a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> test in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type of physician visit was defined by the physician specialty as primary care, mixed specialty (more than 1 specialty, 1 of which was primary care), and nonprimary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used multivariate modeling to assess the influence of type and frequency of physician visits on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately half (46.5%) of enrollees lacked appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the untested group, 19.8% had no physician visits in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enrollees with primary care visits were more likely to be tested than those without a primary care visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many enrollees who had primary care visits remained untested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enrollees with visits to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> physician types had a greater likelihood of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We identified 3 categories of Medicare enrollees without appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> testing: those with no visits, those who see primary care physicians only, and those with multiple visits to physicians with primary and nonprimary care specialties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Different strategies are needed for each category to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> testing in the Medicare population </plain></SENT>
