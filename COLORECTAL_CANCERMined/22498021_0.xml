<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Members of online <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> community completed an Internet survey in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression models examined demographic and attitudinal correlates of interest in sharing and receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening narratives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants (n=2386) were 92% female with mean (SD) age 58 (6) years; 68% were up-to-date with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among those who were up-to-date, 39% were interested in sharing their narratives with other members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>African-Americans were more likely than other racial groups to be interested in sharing narratives (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.14-3.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Older, married members and those with greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening worries were less likely to be interested in sharing narratives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those not up-to-date, 63% were interested in receiving narratives from online community members, and those with higher perceived salience of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were more likely to be interested in receiving narratives (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.31-2.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Members of this online <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> community expressed interest in sharing and receiving narratives for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening promotion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Attitudes and demographic characteristics may predict successful recruitment of those who would share and receive narratives </plain></SENT>
