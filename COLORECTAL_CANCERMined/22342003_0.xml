<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10% of patients with this diagnosis develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e>, although only 2-4% of them have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> as the only extension location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the prognostic factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> who were operated on in our hospital between January 2003 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 30 patients who received surgery, 19 were males (63%) and 11 were female (37%), with a mean age of 63.37 years (range 35-82 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean overall survival was 36.64 months (range 18.58-54.70 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 pre-, intra-, and postoperative parameters were used in the statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> greater than 3 (P=.051), whether they were bilateral (P=.001), or bilobar (P&lt;.001), were statistically significant factors of a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, only being bilobar was shown to be a statistically significant factor of a poor prognosis (P=.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our patient series affected by colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e>, the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> greater than three, whether they are bilobar and bilateral, are factors of a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These factors should be taken into account in the follow-up of these patients, although prospective studies with a larger number of patients are required to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
