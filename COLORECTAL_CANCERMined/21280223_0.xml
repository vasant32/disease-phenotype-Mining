<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This presents challenges in descriptive and comparative analysis of the proteome in response to these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although free-flow electrophoresis has been applied in a number of proteomic studies as a protein separation technique, the combination of free-flow electrophoresis and DIGE has not yet been investigated for comparative proteomic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have compared the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> on HT29 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells with a particular focus on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and describe the utility of a novel approach combining free-flow electrophoresis with DIGE to identify differentially expressed proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We verify the results obtained by the combined free-flow electrophoresis and DIGE approach with Western blot analysis of selected proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also report for the first time the regulation of a number of proteins by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> in HT29 colorectal cells including peptidyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> cis-trans isomerase A (cyclophilin A) and profilin-1 </plain></SENT>
