<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the utility as biomarkers of these mutations in a uniform cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with third-line cetuximab/irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-hundred-and-seven patients were prospectively included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutational analyses of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA were performed on DNA from confirmed malignant tissue using commercially available kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of PTEN and EGFR was assessed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNA was available in 94 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were 44%, 3% and 14%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGF receptor status by IHC and loss of PTEN failed to show any clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KRAS and BRAF were mutually exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Supplementing KRAS analysis with BRAF and PIK3CA identified additional 11% of non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patient with any mutation had a high risk of early progression, whereas triple-negative status implied a response rate (RR) of 41% (p&lt;0.001), a disease control (DC) rate of 73% (p&lt;001), and a significantly higher PFS of 7.7(5.1-8.6 95%CI) versus 2.3 months (2.1-3.695%CI) (p&lt;0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Triple-negative status implied a clear benefit from treatment, and we suggest that patient selection for third-line combination therapy with cetuximab/irinotecan could be based on triple mutational testing </plain></SENT>
