<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In the period 1995-2008, 24,245 colonoscopies were performed and 1041 patients with PCRC were diagnosed: pediculated (n = 220) or sessile (n = 821) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 68.3 Â± 11.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Males were more likely to have PCRC (males 62.6%vs females 37.4%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more pediculated PCRCs were located in the distal colon (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 2005-2008 period the prevalence of PCRC among patients undergoing colonoscopy decreased, the number of polypectomies increased significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) and the pediculated PCRC location changed, with a significant increase in right-sided lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PCRC in patients undergoing colonoscopy decreased, with a significant increase in the number of polypectomies in the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pediculated PCRCs were more often located in the left colon and sessile PCRCs in the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the period 1995-1998 to 2005-2008 the location of pediculated PCRCs changed, with an increase in right-sided lesions </plain></SENT>
