<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monte Carlo simulation techniques were employed to predict the disposition of two mAbs, 8C2 (as a non-binding control mouse IgG1 mAb) and T84.66 (a high-affinity murine IgG1 anti-carcinoembryonic antigen mAb), in mice bearing no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, or bearing colorectal HT29 or LS174T xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Model parameters were obtained or derived from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(125)I-T84.66 and (125)I-8C2 were administered to groups of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice, and plasma and tissue concentrations were determined via gamma counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PBPK model well-predicted the experimental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of the population predicted versus observed areas under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for T84.66 were 95.4 ± 67.8 versus 84.0 ± 3.0, 1,859 ± 682 versus 2,370 ± 154, and 5,930 ± 1,375 versus 5,960 ± 317 (nM × day) at 1, 10, and 25 mg/kg in LS174T xenograft-bearing <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice; and 215 ± 72 versus 233 ± 30, 3,070 ± 346 versus 3,120 ± 180, and 7,884 ± 714 versus 7,440 ± 626 in HT29 xenograft-bearing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Model predicted versus observed 8C2 plasma AUCs were 312.4 ± 30 versus 182 ± 7.6 and 7,619 ± 738 versus 7,840 ± 24.3 (nM × day) at 1 and 25 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High correlations were observed between the predicted median plasma concentrations and observed median plasma concentrations (r (2) = 0.927, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> combinations of treatment, dose, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model), highlighting the utility of the PBPK model for the a priori prediction of in vivo data </plain></SENT>
