<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of the genetic lesions observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> alter expression of homeobox genes, which encode homeodomain transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MEIS1 homeobox gene is known to be involved in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and recent evidence suggests that expression of the MEIS1 transcript is altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite this potential connection, little is known about the role of the gene in the intestines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We probed murine gastrointestinal tissue samples with an N-terminal Meis1 antibody, revealing expression of two previously described isoforms, as well as two novel Meis1 products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 32 kD Meis1 product was expressed in the nuclei of non-epithelial cells in the stomach and colon, while a 27 kD product was expressed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the 27 kD and 32 kD Meis1 proteins are both forms of the Meis1d protein, a homeodomain-less isoform whose transcript was previously identified in cDNA screens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the MEIS1D transcript and protein were expressed in human colon mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of the MEIS1D protein was downregulated in 83% (10/12) of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples compared to matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, indicating that MEIS1D is a biomarker of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decreased expression of MEIS1D in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> also suggests that this conserved homeodomain-less isoform may act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
