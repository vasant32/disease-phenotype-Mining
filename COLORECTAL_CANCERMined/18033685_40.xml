<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Documenting and describing these initiatives is critical to identifying, sharing and promoting best practice in the delivery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the International <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Screening Network (ICRCSN) was established in 2003 to promote best practice in the delivery of organized screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial aim was to identify and document organized screening initiatives that commenced before May 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each identified initiative was sent 1 questionnaire per screening modality: fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy or total colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information was collected on screening methodology, testing details and initiative status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 35 organized initiatives were identified in 17 countries, including 10 routine population-based screening programs, 9 pilots and 16 research projects </plain></SENT>
