<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> affects most chemotherapy recipients, who commonly experience it as distressing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous publications showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients frequently lacked information and education regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>; and while most engaged in self-care activities, it remained unclear why they chose specific activities or how effective those were </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy recipients' current perspectives regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, with particular attention to related communication with health professionals, self-care activities, and perceived effectiveness of these measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was part of a larger project that explored patients' symptom experiences during chemotherapy over three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In this qualitative study, 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, breast, lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> participated concurrently with treatment at a Swiss tertiary care hospital's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on patients' <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> experiences were collected via individual interviews following their third cycle of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grounded Theory methodology guided data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the start of their chemotherapy, health professionals informed patients that common side effects included <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants experienced different dimensions of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, then, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were willing to endure it for the sake of an expected improvement in their conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals' <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> experiences depended largely on their particular life and illness circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most engaged in <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>-related self-care activities and managed the symptom on their own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Communication with or input from health professionals was virtually absent during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adequate and systematic information regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and related self-care strategies need to be implemented at the beginning of chemotherapy, along with continuous assessment and individual guidance of patients throughout their treatment </plain></SENT>
