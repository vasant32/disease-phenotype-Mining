<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is one of the highest on a global level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many epidemiological studies have identified risk and protective factors, many of which have a behavioral component and, therefore, are potentially avoidable or subject to modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the incidence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by gender in twenty different countries, taking into account the dietary habits of the habitants of each country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: adjusted incidence rates, according to gender, were obtained for each country from the International Agency for Research on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> during the period 1971-2002.Annual per capita consumption data of the different dietary variables were obtained for the period 1961-2007 from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated comparing incidence rates according to gender with different dietary variable using ten-year delay intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: there is an important variation in trends of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence worldwide which were found to be related with the dietary habits of each country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: based on the trends observed, each country was classified into one of four different situations based on the range of values of their incidence rates and linear trends observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to the potential of primary prevention programs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and to the delay between changes in the exposure to risk and protective factors and the effects on the incidence of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, the application of legislative and educational measures promoting a healthy diet has become an urgent issue to stop the increasing tendency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> reported worldwide </plain></SENT>
