<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have suggested that treatment with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells may benefit patients with various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor effects of CIK cells against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> line SW1116 in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CIK cells were generated routinely from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy human donors, and the number of CD3(+)CD56(+) cells was expanded more than 1300-fold after 14-day culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At an effector : target cell ratio of 50 : 1, the percentage lysis of SW1116 cells reached 68% in the presence of CIK cells, Experimental mice injected with SW1116 cells subcutaneously were divided randomly into four groups: untreated, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU)-treated, CIK-consecutive treated (injected once/day) and CIK-interval treated (injected once every 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CIK cells were injected abdominally five times in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the untreated group, xenograft growth was inhibited greatly by CIK treatment, to nearly the same extent as with 5-FU treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the necrotic area in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenograft was markedly larger in the CIK-treated groups than in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that CIK-based immunotherapy may represent an effective choice for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
