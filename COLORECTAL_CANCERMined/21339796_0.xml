<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients' disease state was found to be highly advanced based on both computed tomography findings and liver function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment strategy included an initial administration of HAIC to control <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and improve liver function in order to facilitate the subsequent safe administration of FOLFOX without drug loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the HAIC regimen, 1,000 mg/m2 of 5-FU was administered weekly by continuous 5-h infusion after performing laboratory investigations through an implanted port-catheter system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 HAIC cycles administered over 3 consecutive weeks, the mean alkaline phosphatase levels decreased from 969.3IU/l to 422IU/l due to shrinkage of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, FOLFOX without drug loss could be safely initiated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients succumbed 488 and 333 days after HAIC was initiated;the third patient is still alive and has been followed-up for 1215 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined use of HAIC and standard systemic chemotherapy could be a feasible and efficacious treatment in highly advanced cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
