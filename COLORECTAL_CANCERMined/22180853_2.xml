<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (CTC) are believed to have undergone EMT and thus lack or express low levels of epithelial markers commonly used for enrichment and/or detection of such cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, most current CTC detection methods target only EpCAM and/or cytokeratin (CK) to enrich epithelial CTCs, resulting in failure to recognize other, perhaps more important, CTC phenotypes that lack expression of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a population of complex aneuploid CTCs that do not express CK or CD45 antigen in patients with breast, ovarian, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells were not observed in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205853" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">epithelial tumors</z:e> were characterized by similar complex <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, indicating conversion to an EMT phenotype in the captured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our study provides a new method for highly efficient capture of previously unrecognized populations of CTCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significance: Current assays for CTC capture likely miss populations of cells that have undergone EMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Capture and study of CTCs that have undergone EMT would allow a better understanding of the mechanisms driving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
