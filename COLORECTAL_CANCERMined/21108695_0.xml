<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous report demonstrated a good correlation between high telomerase activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues and a poor prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, except for several cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the additional factors that contribute to patient prognosis, the correlation among the expression levels of telomere binding proteins (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi>), the lengths of telomeres, the lengths of telomere 3'-overhang (3'-OH) and telomerase activity in 106 paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and corresponding noncancerous mucosa (NCM) specimens were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of eight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> genes (TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, TANK1, TANK2, POT1, RAP1 and TPP1) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 106 cases, 35 cases had shortened telomeres (&lt;7 kb), 15 had shortened 3'-OH (3'-OH length ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>/NCM &lt;0.5) and 88 were classified as telomerase-activated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (activity ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>/NCM &gt;2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison between NCM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in each case showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> except for POT1 were downregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that the survival rate of the telomerase-activated cases with shortened 3'-OH and that of telomerase-inactivated cases were significantly better than that of telomerase-activated cases without 3'-OH shortening, that is, restored or maintained 3'-OH (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the telomerase-activated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, the length of 3'-OH was significantly correlated with the expression levels of POT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elongation of telomeric overhang by telomerase, which might be regulated by POT1, may contribute to the increase of malignant potential in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
