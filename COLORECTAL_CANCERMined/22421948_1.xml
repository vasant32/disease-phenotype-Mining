<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of the anti-hyperglycemic agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is associated with a reduced incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 4758 patients seen at a single institution and determined that 424 patients were identified by their physicians as having type II DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were subsequently acquired determining the subject's age, body mass index (BMI), and disease date of diagnosis, stage, site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, treatment, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with type II DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as one of their diabetic medications had a survival of 76.9 months (95% CI=61.4-102.4) as compared with 56.9 months in those patients not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (95% CI=44.8-68.8), P=0.048 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using a multivariable Cox regression model adjusted for age, sex, race, BMI, and initial stage of disease, we demonstrated that type II diabetic patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> had a 30% improvement in overall survival (OS) when compared with diabetic patients treated with other diabetic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with DM treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> as part of their diabetic therapy appear to have a superior OS </plain></SENT>
