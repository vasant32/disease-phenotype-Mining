<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relation between Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (CC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several case reports and retrospective studies have shown that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) have a 6- to 20-fold higher risk to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than does the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent of disease (extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>), presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010447'>anal fistula</z:hpo>, age &gt; 40 years, strictures, and length of disease &gt;10 years may be important determinants for increasing risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite this evidence, other population-based studies have shown no increased risk of colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate retrospectively factors that may predict the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the histopathologic database of the Digestive Surgery Unit at Careggi University Hospital for CC patients (January 1987 to September 2011) and identified 313 patients with CC who underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There are 11 (3.5 %) of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed disease duration (p = 0.001), age at CD diagnosis (p = 0.002), distal localization (p = 0.045), and penetrating disease (p = 0.041) to be risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that 40 patients who had undergone previous immunosuppressive therapy had a significant risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> patients who require surgery are at higher risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, particularly those whose disease duration is &gt;10 years, have distal localization, age at diagnosis was &lt;40 years, and have penetrating disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previous immunosuppressive therapy should be better investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend surgery for any patient presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267466" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic strictures</z:e> </plain></SENT>
