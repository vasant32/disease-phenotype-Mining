<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey; National Health and Wellness Survey; Nationwide Inpatient Sample; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; National Vital Statistics System; Thompson Reuters MarketScan; Medicare; Medicaid; and the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative's National Endoscopic Database </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>Acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> was the most common reason for hospitalization (274,119 discharges) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 6.9 million upper, 11.5 million lower, and 228,000 biliary endoscopies performed in 2009 </plain></SENT>
