<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Resection of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is associated with enhanced risk of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was previously demonstrated that surgery initiated an early <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> resulting in elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) are shown to be produced and released during surgery, the effects of ROS on the liver vascular lining and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human endothelial cell monolayers (human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human microvascular endothelial cells of the lung (HMEC-1s)) were exposed to ROS production, after which electrical impedance, cellular integrity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, surgery-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> as well as the role of ROS and liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) in this process were studied in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Production of ROS decreased cellular impedance of endothelial monolayers dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, formation of intercellular gaps in endothelial monolayers was observed, exposing subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) on which colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells adhered via integrin molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelial damage was, however, prevented in the presence of ROS-scavenging enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, surgery induced downregulation of both rat and human liver tight junction molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of rats with the ROS scavenger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> prevented surgery-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and downregulation of tight junction proteins in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of Kupffer cells prior to surgery significantly reduced the numbers of adhered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells and prevented disruption of expression of tight junction proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study it is shown that surgery-induced ROS production by macrophages damages the vascular lining by downregulating tight junction proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This leads to exposure of ECM, to which circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells bind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In light of this, perioperative therapeutic intervention, preventing surgery-induced inflammatory reactions, may reduce the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, thereby improving the clinical outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
