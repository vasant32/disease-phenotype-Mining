<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LS is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disease characterized by mutations in the mismatch repair genes mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), postmeiotic segregation increased 1 (PMS1), post-meiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2) and mutS homolog 6 (MSH6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation risk prediction models can be incorporated into clinical practice, facilitating the decision-making process and identifying individuals for molecular investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is extremely important in countries with limited economic resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aims to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of five predictive models for germline mutations in repair genes in a sample of individuals with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples from 88 patients were analyzed through sequencing MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of detecting a mutation was calculated using the PREMM, Barnetson, MMRpro, Wijnen and Myriad models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the models, receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 88 patients included in this analysis, 31 mutations were identified: 16 were found in the MSH2 gene, 15 in the MLH1 gene and no pathogenic mutations were identified in the MSH6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the AUC for the PREMM (0.846), Barnetson (0.850), MMRpro (0.821) and Wijnen (0.807) models did not present significant statistical difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Myriad model presented lower AUC (0.704) than the four other models evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Considering thresholds of â‰¥ 5%, the models sensitivity varied between 1 (Myriad) and 0.87 (Wijnen) and specificity ranged from 0 (Myriad) to 0.38 (Barnetson) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Barnetson, PREMM, MMRpro and Wijnen models present similar AUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The AUC of the Myriad model is statistically inferior to the four other models </plain></SENT>
