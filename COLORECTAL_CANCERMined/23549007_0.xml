<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is an independent prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the significance of CEA as a prognostic or predictive factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 609 patients with locally advanced (cStage II-III) mid to distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who underwent preoperative CRT and radical surgery between 2001 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictive factors for pathologic CRT response were determined using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A prognostic factor analysis was performed using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated CEA levels (&gt;5 ng/mL) were observed in 201 (33.0%) patients at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following preoperative CRT, downstaging (ypStage 0-I) occurred in 255 (41.9%) patients, of whom 88 had pathologic complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment CEA was significantly associated with pathologic CRT response in terms of downstaging and <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grade, and was the most relevant predictive factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up period of 60 months, the 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 76.2% and 84.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors independently associated with recurrence or survival included ypStage, circumferential resection margin, and histologic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who received preoperative CRT, the pretreatment CEA level was a significant and independent predictor of pathologic CRT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, it may not be able to predict long-term outcomes independently of ypStage </plain></SENT>
