<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and matched distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues were collected from 92 patients diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by surgical operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression level of CTGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty out of 92 pairs of tissue specimens were selected randomly to detect CTGF protein by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases were followed up to identify prognostic factors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CTGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of CTGF protein expression tissues(73.3%) was significantly higher than that in the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues(23.3%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTGF expression was lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic metastasis</z:e> or stage III(/IIII( disease(<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A negative association was also observed between the CTGF protein positive rate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltration depth(P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative expression of CTGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues was classified into high and low expression groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year cumulative survival rate was lower in patients with low CTGF expression(29.3%) as compared to those with high CTGF expressions(68.3%)(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis revealed that the relative expression level of CTGF was independent factor of overall survival(RR=2.960, 95%CI:1.491-1.587, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ROC curve analysis showed that sensitivity and specificity of CTGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for prediction of 5-year survival were 64.9% and 74.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aberrant expression of CTGF is associated with the malignant biological behaviors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Low expression of CTGF is associated with worse prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
