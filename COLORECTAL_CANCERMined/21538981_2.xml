<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fecal occult blood test is currently the first line method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, but has unacceptably low sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improved screening tests are therefore urgently required for early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening when therapy is most likely to be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a discovery-based proteomics hypothesis using orthogonal multi-dimensional fractionation (1-D <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE, RP-HPLC, size exclusion chromatography) to mine deep into the fecal proteome for the initial discovery process, which generated a library containing 108 human fecal proteins with the associated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and MS/MS data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were then used to develop and optimize a multiplex multiple reaction monitoring assay for 40 non-redundant human proteins present in the feces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To show proof of principal for clinical analysis, multiplex screening of these 40 proteins was carried out on fecal samples from eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient and seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified 24 proteins consistently found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples and nine proteins found only in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, showing the potential of this approach for the analysis of potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biomarkers </plain></SENT>
