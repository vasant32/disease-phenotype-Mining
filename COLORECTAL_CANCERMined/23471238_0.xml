<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, trastuzumab has been validated for use in other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But the data on HER2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are ambiguous, with reported overexpression of HER2 varying between zero and 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review these studies are evaluated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It shows that many factors influence the determination of HER2-expression, especially of the intracellular fraction of HER2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that although membranous overexpression of HER2 is low in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with only 5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients being positive, a significant proportion of the patients (30%) shows cytoplasmic HER2 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical impact of enhanced intracellular HER2 is not known, because the nature and origin have not completely been revealed yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enlightening this process could be a stepping stone towards targeting of intracellular HER2 as a treatment option </plain></SENT>
