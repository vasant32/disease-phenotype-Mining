<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evolving evidence support the prognostic and predictive role of these cells in patients affected by several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ongoing studies are aimed at confirming that the molecular characterization of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in peripheral blood and in bone marrow of patients is a powerful tool to improve the patient risk-stratification, to monitor activity of the drugs, to develop more appropriate targeted therapies and tailored treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel, results from these correlative studies promise to gain a better biological understanding of the metastatic process </plain></SENT>
