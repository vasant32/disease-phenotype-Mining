<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> were prospectively enroled to undergo perfusion CT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET/CT before and after one-cycle of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists and three nuclear medicine physicians measured various perfusion CT and PET/CT parameters, respectively from the largest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline values and reduction rates of the parameters were compared between responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spearman correlation test was used to correlate perfusion CT and PET/CT parameters, using RECIST criteria as reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients responded to treatment, eight patients were nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline SUVmean30 on PET/CT, reduction rates of 30% metabolic volume and 30% lesion glycolysis (LG30) on PET/CT and blood flow (BF) and flow extraction product (FEP) on perfusion CT after chemotherapy were significantly different between responders and nonresponders (P=0.008-0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduction rates of BF (correlation coefficient=0.630) and FEP (correlation coefficient=0.578) significantly correlated with that of LG30 on PET/CT (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT perfusion parameters including BF and FEP may be used as early predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
