<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that VEGF can delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cellular senescence in human endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As VEGF receptors are known to be upregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we hypothesized that VEGF inhibition may directly influence cellular senescence in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our study, we observed that treatment with bevacizumab caused a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in cellular senescence in vitro in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, such as MIP101, RKO, SW620 and SW480 cells, compared to untreated or human IgG-treated control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were also obtained from cells treated with a VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor Ki8751 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, cellular senescence was detected in MIP101 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts from 75% of mice treated with bevacizumab, while cellular senescence was undetectable in xenografts from mice treated with saline or human IgG (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we also observed that the proportion of senescent cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissues obtained from patients treated with bevacizumab was 4.4-fold higher (p &lt; 0.01) than those of untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To understand how VEGF inhibitors may regulate cellular senescence, we noted that among the two important regulators of senescent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, bevacizumab-associated increase in cellular senescence coincided with an upregulation of p16 but appeared to be independent of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>siRNA silencing of p16 gene in MIP101 cells suppressed bevacizumab-induced cellular senescence, while silencing of p53 had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate a novel antitumor activity of VEGF inhibitors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, involving p16 </plain></SENT>
