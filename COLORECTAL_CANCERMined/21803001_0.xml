<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients must have transportation to the treatment site before they can access appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article describes factors associated with patients experiencing transportation-related barriers to accessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care Assessment &amp; Responsive Evaluation Studies (C-CARES) questionnaire was mailed to Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) during the fall of 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were diagnosed at any VA facility in 2008, they were men, and alive at the time of the mailing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 1409 surveys were returned (approximately 67% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess transportation barriers, patients were asked how often it was difficult to get transportation to or from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were assessed using validated Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales for <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, pain, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine determinants of transportation barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A minority of respondents (19%) reported transportation barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients experiencing pain (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06) had greater odds of transportation barriers than patients without this symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who reported no primary social support (OR, 6.13; 95% CI, 3.10-12.14) or nonspousal support (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.40-2.87) were more likely to experience transportation barriers than patients whose spouses provided social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Patients with uncontrolled pain or less social support have greater odds of transportation barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The directional association between social support, symptoms, and transportation cannot be determined in this data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inquiring about accessible transportation should become a routine part of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care, particularly for patients with known risk factors </plain></SENT>
