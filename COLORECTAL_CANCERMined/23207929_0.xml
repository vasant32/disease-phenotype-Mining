<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: During the last two decades, hundreds of reports have detailed putative prognostic and predictive biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of these studies have been small and retrospective, reporting results that are highly likely to represent false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, their relevance to clinical practice requires definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of published literature on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biomarkers, focusing on early-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although most putative biomarkers have failed to be validated in subsequent studies, level I evidence now indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> microsatellite instability can be used to identify a cohort of patients with stage IIA disease at low risk of relapse who can be spared adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emerging data suggest that gene expression arrays may have a role in selecting patients with stage IIA disease and mismatch repair-proficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> for chemotherapy following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the profusion of biomarker literature, only mismatch repair status can be recommended as routine in current clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-quality, adequately powered studies are essential to accurately define the utility of existing and putative biomarkers, and to support their rational application in the clinic </plain></SENT>
