<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the clinical and molecular phenotypes of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in kidney transplant recipients and compare with those in the nonimmunosuppressed population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the first time, we analyzed the impact of KRAS and BRAF mutations in kidney transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Kidney transplant recipients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were diagnosed and followed up from 1992 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and were matched with the general population with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the possible mechanisms involved in the clinical behavior of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, we compared the tumoral expression by immunohistochemical analysis of molecule markers of mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) pathway, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and proliferation, and the role of activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was more prevalent and exhibited a trend for worse prognosis in transplant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the mTOR pathway was activated in both populations, activation was lower in transplant patients because of relatively higher phosphatase and tensin homolog expression in the former </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> was activated in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were found in transplant recipients treated with calcineurin inhibitors and with high expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The activation of oncogenic pathways could be responsible for the clinical behavior of posttransplant colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mutation status of the KRAS gene is likely involved in mTOR pathway and to be a prognosis marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in kidney transplantation </plain></SENT>
