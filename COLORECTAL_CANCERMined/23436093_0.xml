<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, feasibility, and short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery by a single surgical fellow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study analyzed the data from 143 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection by a single surgical fellow between August 2009 and October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups: the early group-the first 70 patients (under supervision of experienced surgeon), and the late group-the last 73 patients (without supervision) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The short-term surgical results were compared between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The operations were 24 right colon resections, two transverse colectomies, six left colectomies, 36 anterior resections, 57 low anterior resections, 12 intersphincteric resections, two abdominoperineal resections, three Hartmann's operations, and 1 total colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean operating time, mean amounts of blood loss, and conversion rate were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The morbidity rate, anastomosis leak rate, and mortality rate within 30 days of surgery did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean number of lymph nodes was larger in the late group (23.8 vs. 31.7, P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In terms of low anterior resection, the mean number of endo-linear staplers used was smaller in the late group (2.46 ± 0.81 vs. 1.97 ± 0.83, P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The anastomosis leakage rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> surgery was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that laparoscopic colorectal resections can be independently performed safely after a period of supervision and training by an experienced surgeon </plain></SENT>
