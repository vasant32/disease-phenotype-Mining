<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) had expanded the range of treatment options for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, such type of treatment was shown to be ineffective if there is K-ras mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most previous studies K-ras gene mutation was mainly assessed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: Our work is designed to detect K-ras protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) aiming to reach a preliminary method that could be confirmed by PCR and considered an alternative way for the detection of K-ras aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We are also aiming to find a relation between K-ras protein expression and K-ras gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paraffin embedded tissue samples from 26 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients were analyzed for K-ras protein expression by IHC using Rap1A polyclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staining patterns were subjectively assessed and correlated with clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were statistically evaluated using the Chi-square test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: K-ras cytoplasmic positivity was observed in 42.3% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positivity was either strong in 26.9% or moderate in 15.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> variants, 50% of cases were positive for K-ras protein expression while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mucinous and signet ring types were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The positivity was noted in 50% of moderately differentiated GII colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> as compared with 38.9% in poorly differentiated GIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Positive staining was observed in 40% of cases with positive lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> while in the absence of nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> the positivity was 45.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between clinicopathological parameters and K-ras staining results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IHC may compliment PCR in the detection of K-ras mutation </plain></SENT>
