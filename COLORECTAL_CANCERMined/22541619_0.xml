<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These improvements apply to many aspects of colonoscopy, including screening effectiveness, reduced pain and complications, in vivo lesion classification, and easier insertion methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inherent characteristics of colonoscopy such as blind spots, residual stool, colonic contractions, and the subtle nature of some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> present challenges to colonoscopic effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the advent of several promising techniques, these issues are being addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wide-angle colonoscopes, retroflexion, and water immersion technique are methods that have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, there is a need to reduce complications and improve patient acceptance and comfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The education of endoscopists has appropriately focused on awareness of potential complications, with recent advances in the ability to manage complications such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite its effectiveness, there are key opportunities to further improve colonoscopy including reducing the cost, improving the quality and tolerance of bowel preparation, and upgrading variance in detection and removal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
