<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Preoperative radiotherapy has been shown to enable a fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> to become resectable which in turn may result in long-time survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analysed the outcome of long-course preoperative radiotherapy in fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in a national cohort including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danish patients registered with primary inoperable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and treated in the period May 2001 to December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The study was based on surgical and demographic data from a continuously updated and validated national database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, retrospective data were retrieved from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> departments of radiotherapy concerning technique of radiotherapy, dose and fractionation and use of concomitant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was determined by actuarial analysis of local control, disease-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 258 patients with fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> received long-course radiotherapy (&gt; 45 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis was 66 years (range: 32-85) and 185 (72%) patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resectability rate was 80%, and a R0 resection was obtained in 148 patients (57% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 61% of those operated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5-year local recurrence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 5% (95% CI: 3-7%), and the actuarial distant recurrence rate was 41% (95% CI: 35-47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 5-year disease-free survival was 27% (95% CI: 22-32%) and overall 5-year survival was 34% (95% CI: 29-39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first population-based report on outcome of preoperative long-course radiotherapy in a large unselected patient group with clinically fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most patients could be resected with the intention of cure and one in three was alive after 5 years </plain></SENT>
