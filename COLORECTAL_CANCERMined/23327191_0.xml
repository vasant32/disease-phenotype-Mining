<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>XRCC1 genotypes of totally 99 patients (37 stage III and 62 stage IV) with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy were detected by the TaqMan-MGB probe allelic discrimination method, and clinical response of 62 patients in stage IV after 2 to 3 cycles of chemotherapy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that of the genotype frequencies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, up to 52.53% were G/G genotype, 9.09% were A/A genotype, and 38.38% were G/A genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate (CR + PR) of 62 patients in stage IV was 61.29% (19/31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with G/G genotype showed enhanced response to chemotherapy compared with those with G/A + A/A (x(2) = 5.6, p = .029; Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.845, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.231 ∼ 12.01, p = .018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals with the G/G genotype had a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> of 10.0 (8.88-11.12) months, and those with the G/A + A/A genotype had a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> of 5.0 (4.26-5.74) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Log-Rank test was marginally significant (x(2) = 29.20, p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for stage, performance status, and chemotherapy regimen showed that only XRCC1 G/G genotype increases the OR significantly (OR = 3.555; 95% CI, 2.119 ∼ 5.963; p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism is associated with response to oxaliplantin-based chemotherapy and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism should be routinely detected to screen patients who are more likely to benefit from oxaliplantin-based treatment </plain></SENT>
