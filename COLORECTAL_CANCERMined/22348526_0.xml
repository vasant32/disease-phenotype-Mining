<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is a preference survey which asks participants to make a choice among product portfolios comparing the key product characteristics by performing several choice tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analyzing DCE data needs to account for within-participant correlation because choices from the same participant are likely to be similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we empirically compared some commonly-used statistical methods for analyzing DCE data while accounting for within-participant correlation based on a survey of patient preference for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening tests conducted in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A two-stage DCE design was used to investigate the impact of six attributes on participants' preferences for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test and willingness to undertake the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared six models for clustered binary outcomes (logistic and probit regressions using cluster-robust standard error (SE), random-effects and generalized estimating equation approaches) and three models for clustered nominal outcomes (multinomial logistic and probit regressions with cluster-robust SE and random-effects multinomial logistic model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also fitted a bivariate probit model with cluster-robust SE treating the choices from two stages as two correlated binary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rank of relative importance between attributes and the estimates of β coefficient within attributes were used to assess the model robustness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total 468 participants with each completing 10 choices were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were reported for the rank of relative importance and β coefficients across models for stage-one data on evaluating participants' preferences for the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The six attributes ranked from high to low as follows: cost, specificity, process, sensitivity, preparation and pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the results differed across models for stage-two data on evaluating participants' willingness to undertake the tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Little within-patient correlation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> ≈ 0) was found in stage-one data, but substantial within-patient correlation existed (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.659) in stage-two data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When small clustering effect presented in DCE data, results remained robust across statistical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, results varied when larger clustering effect presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to assess the robustness of the estimates via sensitivity analysis using different models for analyzing clustered data from DCE studies </plain></SENT>
