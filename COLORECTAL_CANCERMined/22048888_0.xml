<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined frequency/types of K-ras mutations in colorectal/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ADx-K-ras kit (real-time/double-loop probe PCR) was used to detect somatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> gene mutations compared with Sanger DNA sequencing using 583 colorectal and 244 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> paraffin-embedded clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was used in both methods; mutation rates at codons 12/13 and frequency of each mutation were detected and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data show that 91.4% colorectal and 59.0% <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> samples were detected conclusively by DNA sequencing, whereas 100% colorectal and lung samples were detected by ADx-K-ras kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>K-ras gene mutations were detected in 32.9-27.4% colorectal samples using kit and sequencing methods, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas 10.6-8.3% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> samples were positively detected by kit and sequencing methods, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, 172/677 showed mutations and 467/677 showed <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> by both methods; 38 samples showed mutations with kit but <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> with sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations in colorectal samples were as follows: GGT → GAT/codon-12 (35.1%); GGC → GAC/codon-13 (26.6%); GGT → <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>/codon-12 (18.2%); and GGT → <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>/codon-12 (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations in lung samples were as follows: GGT &gt; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>/codon-12 (40.9%) and GGT &gt; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>/codon-12 (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, K-ras mutations involved 32.2% colorectal and 10.6% lung samples among this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ADx-K-ras real-time PCR showed higher detection rates (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The kit method has good clinical applicability as it is simple, fast, less prone to contamination and hence can be used effectively and reliably for clinical screening of somatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> gene mutations </plain></SENT>
