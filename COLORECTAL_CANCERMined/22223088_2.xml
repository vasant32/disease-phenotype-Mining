<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor bevacizumab has been incorporated into standard of care with chemotherapy in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phase I study established the safety, tolerability and clinical pharmacokinetics of olaparib alone and in combination with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> received increasing doses of continuous oral olaparib (100, 200 and 400 mg b.i.d. capsule formulation) in combination with bevacizumab (10 mg kg(-1) intravenous q2w) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 12 patients enrolled and received treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events (AEs) related to olaparib were grade 1/2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No haematological parameters were reported as AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No serious AEs related to olaparib or dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients discontinued due to AEs, two patients discontinued both olaparib and bevacizumab and one patient discontinued olaparib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients received combination treatment for over 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that bevacizumab affected olaparib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of olaparib 400 mg b.i.d. with bevacizumab 10 mg kg(-1) q2w was generally well tolerated with no DLTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This combination could be considered for future clinical investigation </plain></SENT>
