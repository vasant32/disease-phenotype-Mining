<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This new technique has generated strong interest among surgeons worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, single-port laparoscopic colon surgery has not yet been standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim in this study was to evaluate the feasibility of single-port laparoscopic colectomy compared with conventional laparoscopic colectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a case-matched, controlled study comparing single-port laparoscopic colectomy to conventional laparoscopic colectomy for right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of ten patients were included for the single-port laparoscopic colectomy (S-LAC) group and ten patients for the conventional laparoscopic colectomy (C-LAC) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The length of the skin incision in the S-LAC group was significantly shorter than that of the C-LAC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our early experiences indicated that S-LAC for right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> is a feasible and safe procedure and that S-LAC results in a better cosmetic outcome </plain></SENT>
