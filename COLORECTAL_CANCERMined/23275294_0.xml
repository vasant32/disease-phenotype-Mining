<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are interconnected and responsible for important features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> phenotype including invasiveness, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines whether combinational inhibition of both integrin and Src pathways would exert greater antiangiogenesis and antitumor effects than either pathway alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using in-vitro cell culture systems, the activity of CNTO95 (Intetumumab), an αV integrin inhibitor, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi>, an Src inhibitor, on proliferation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and migration was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, HCT-116 and RKO, as well as HUVEC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antiangiogenic effect of this combinatory regimen was also tested using an in-vitro tubular network formation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of CNTO95 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> on the activation of Src and integrin pathway signal transduction were also determined by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of CNTO95 plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, migration, and paxillin phosphorylation in both HCT-116 and RKO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CNTO95 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> also led to <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of HCT-116 cells; however, similar effects were not observed in RKO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, dual treatment of CNTO95 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> exerted enhanced effects on HUVEC cell proliferation, invasion, tubular network formation, and paxillin phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that concurrent inhibition of both the integrin and the Src pathways exert more pronounced antiangiogenic and antitumor effects than with either pathway being inhibited alone </plain></SENT>
