<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, there are lacks of information regarding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> whole tissue- colon proteome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report here a detailed murine (mouse) whole tissue- colon protein reference dataset composed of 1237 confident protein (FDR &lt; 2) with comprehensive insight on its <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> properties, cellular and subcellular localization, functional network <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> annotation analysis, and its relative abundances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presented dataset includes wide spectra of pI and Mw ranged from 3-12 and 4-600 KDa, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gravy index scoring predicted 19.5% membranous and 80.5% globularly located proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> hierarchies and functional network analysis illustrated proteins function together with their relevance and implication of several candidates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>- activated protein kinase (Mapk8, 9) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, Fibroblast growth factor receptor (Fgfr 2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (Gstp1) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, and Cell division control protein (Cdc42), Ras-related protein (Rac1,2) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein abundances calculated with 3 different algorithms (NSAF, PAF and emPAI) provide a relative quantification under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition as guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This highly confidence colon proteome catalogue will not only serve as a useful reference for further experiments characterizing differentially expressed proteins induced from diseased conditions, but also will aid in better understanding the ontology and functional absorptive mechanism of the colon as well </plain></SENT>
