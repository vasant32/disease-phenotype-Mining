<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new sensitive method for multiplex gene-specific methylation analysis was developed using a ligation-based approach combined with a TaqMan-based detection and readout employing universal reporter probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The approach, termed methylation-specific Ligation Detection Reaction (msLDR), was applied to test 16 loci in 8 different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These loci encode immune regulatory genes involved in T-cell and natural killer cell activation, whose silencing is associated with the development or progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parallel analysis of HLA-A, HLA-B, STAT1, B2M, LMP2, LMP7, PA28Î±, TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP, ULBP2 and ULBP3 by msLDR in eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines showed preferential methylation at the HLA-B, ULBP2 and ULBB3 loci, but not at the other loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MsLDR was found to represent a suitable and sensitive method for the detection of distinct methylation patterns as validated by conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> Sanger sequencing and COBRA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since gene silencing by epigenetic mechanisms plays a central role during transformation of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> differentiated somatic cell into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell, characterization of the gene methylation status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> is a major topic not only in basic research, but also in clinical diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to a very simple workflow, msLDR is likely to be applicable to clinical samples and thus comprises a potential diagnostic tool for clinical purposes </plain></SENT>
