<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The optimal management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-LM) has changed during the past two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, clinical practice lags behind best evidence recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to characterize the gap between current practice and best evidence for the management of these patients and to identify barriers that hamper effective utilization of metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A survey was mailed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> general surgeons (GS) and medical oncologists (MO) in Ontario, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Domains examined included: physician/practice characteristics, indications for hepatectomy, use of multi-modality therapy and referral patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physician focus groups were conducted that explored issues relating to access to care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The survey was mailed to 942 physicians with a response rate of 68 % (n = 348; GS n = 295, 69 %; MO n = 53, 63 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current practice patterns demonstrated that 97 % of physicians refer patients with low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden (e.g., solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-LM), but referral rates for hepatectomy decreased as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physicians still consider extrahepatic disease as a strong contraindication to metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Barriers to care included: economic, time, and resource constraints; lack of physician engagement, local medical expertise, and high-quality guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multidisciplinary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> conferences were identified as an enabler of clinical care and a potential platform for the acquisition of new medical knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-LM does not reflect best evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients who may benefit from surgery are not being referred for metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We have identified an evidence-practice gap at the level of physician, which should be targeted with novel quality improvement strategies </plain></SENT>
