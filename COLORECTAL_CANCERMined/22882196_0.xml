<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ultrasound (US) is the most commonly used form of image guidance during liver surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the use of navigation systems that incorporate instrument tracking and three-dimensional visualization of preoperative tomography is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes an initial experience using an image-guidance system with navigated US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An image-guidance system was used in a total of 50 open liver procedures to aid in localization and targeting of liver lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An optical tracking system was employed to localize surgical instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Customized hardware and calibration of the US transducer were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of three procedures are highlighted in order to illustrate specific navigation techniques that proved useful in the broader patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 7-month span, the navigation system assisted in completing 21 (42%) of the procedures, and tracked US alone provided additional information required to perform resection or ablation in six procedures (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average registration time during the three illustrative procedures was &lt;1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average set-up time was approximately 5 min per procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Explorerâ„¢ Liver guidance system represents novel technology that continues to evolve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This initial experience indicates that image guidance is valuable in certain procedures, specifically in cases in which difficult <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location or echogenicity limit the usefulness of traditional guidance methods </plain></SENT>
