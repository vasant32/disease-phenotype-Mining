<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the mechanism of enhancement of radiation-induced cytotoxicity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> on radiation-induced cytotoxicity of DLD-1 and HT-29 were evaluated via clonogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> on radiation-induced cell cycle kinetics and on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was analyzed using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cyclin B1 was examined by western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a measure of DNA damage after treatment, γ-H2AX foci and nuclear fragmentation were determined as a function of time after irradiation plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> combination </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of each cell line to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> combined with irradiation resulted in an increased radiation-induced cytotoxicity with dose enhancement factors at a surviving fraction of 0.37 ranging from 1.13 to 1.76 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">Sorafenib</z:chebi> strengthened radiation-induced accumulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in the G2-M phase with attenuated expression of cyclin B1, but had no effect on radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> and radiation resulted in a greater number of remaining γ-H2AX foci and fragmented nuclei than radiation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenograft study confirmed that administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> results in significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibition when combined with radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> enhances radiation-induced cytotoxicity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and suggest that the mechanism is associated with delaying repair of radiation-induced DNA damage and down-regulation of cyclin B1 </plain></SENT>
