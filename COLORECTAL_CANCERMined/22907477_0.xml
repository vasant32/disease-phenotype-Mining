<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, prioritizing variants according to their potential deleterious effects has become essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We constructed a disease gene network and proposed a Bayesian ensemble approach that integrates diverse sources to predict the functional effects of missense variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 23,336 missense disease mutations and 36,232 neutral polymorphisms of 12,039 human proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed successful improvement of prediction accuracy in both sensitivity and specificity, and we demonstrated the utility of the method by applying it to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> obtained from colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The candidate genes with predicted deleterious mutations as well as known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genes were significantly enriched in many KEGG pathways related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, supporting genetic homogeneity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at the pathway level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>-specific network increased the prediction accuracy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study provides a ranked list of deleterious mutations and candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genes and suggests that mutations affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> may occur in important pathways and should be interpreted on the phenotype-related network or pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A disease gene network may be of value in predicting functional effects of novel disease-specific mutations </plain></SENT>
