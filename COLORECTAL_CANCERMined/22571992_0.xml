<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of 15,169 participants belonging to a prospective cohort study (the SUN Project) based on two self-reported questionnaires: one of them related to lifestyle and the other a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored the influence of family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in lifestyles (consumption of alcohol, weight, and diet) and medical management behaviors (screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: People with family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> increased their number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests (adjusted odds ratio for fecal occult blood test: 1.98, 95% confidence interval: 1.48-2.65; and adjusted odds ratio for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy: 3.42, 2.69-4.36); nevertheless, health behavior changes in diet of relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show that individuals with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> increase their compliance with screening tests, although they exhibit no better health-related behaviors than people without family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are required to confirm these results and to identify tools to empower the subjects to change their risk profile </plain></SENT>
