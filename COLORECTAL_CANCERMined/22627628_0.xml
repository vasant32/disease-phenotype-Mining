<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a need to determine new prognostic factors because of high frequency and significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: 204 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> diagnosed between 01.01.2005 - 31.12.2008 at UludaÄŸ University Medical Faculty Pathology Department were studied for Factor VIII and c-erbB-2 immunohistochemically and with toluidine blue stain histochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Association of mast cell number, microvessel density, and c-erbB-2 staining pattern with survival and known prognostic factors was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up period was 4-60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 111 cases were alive, and 65 had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of mast cells was 8.00 (1-21) and the mean density of microvessels was 10.00 (2-21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rate of the mast cell group was 48.3% for values under 10 and 57.9% for values of 10 and higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rate was 58.2% in the group with a microvessel density of 10 and above and 45.9% for values under 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rate was 53.9% for the group with c-erbB-2 cytoplasmic staining and 48.2% for the group with membranous staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The grade increased with the number of mast cells, while survival decreased with an increase in the number of mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ratio of c-erbB-2 staining increased as the grade and stage increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was an association between mast cell number and microvessel density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We found no relationship between prognosis and c-erbB-2, mast cell number, and microvessel density </plain></SENT>
