<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the association between prediagnostic serum levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> indicators (i.e., reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP)) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was examined in a nested case-control study (1,064 CRC cases, 1,064 matched controls) in the European Prospective Investigation Into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition cohort (1992-2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using conditional logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ROM were associated with overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (highest tertile vs. lowest: adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR(adj)) = 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.47, 2.48), proximal (IRR(adj) = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.36) and distal (IRR(adj) = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.37, 3.89) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (IRR(adj) = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When results were stratified by tertile of follow-up time, the association remained significant only in participants with less than 2.63 years of follow-up (IRR(adj) = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.78, 2.94; P-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
