<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">Glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK3B) serves a critical role in regulating their functions by phosphorylating both APC and CTNNB1 to facilitate CTNNB1 degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current studies were performed to investigate whether GSK3B itself is regulated during the process of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the expression of GSK3B and CTNNB1 in tissue samples from 24 human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> by Western immunoblotting analysis, kinase activity assays and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa from the same colectomy specimens were used as a reference for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated that GSK3B expression levels and kinase activities were markedly and significantly increased in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 cases compared with paired adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These increases correlated with significantly increased expression of CTNNB1 in the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in several cultured human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, demonstrating GSK3B levels correlated with CTNNB1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Though APC and CTNNB1 regulation by GSK3B are frequently disrupted by mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>, our observations suggest that increased functional GSK3B might drive other growth-promoting signals in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
