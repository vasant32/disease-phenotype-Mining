<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) which includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) of the colon are at risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed the methylation status of selected genes as a risk marker in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed methylation frequency of 4 genes [secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), transcription elongation regulator 1-like (TCERG1L), fibrillin 2 (FBN2) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2)] in biopsies of 36 UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SFRP1 and TCERG1L genes showed high methylation frequencies but FBN2 and TFPI2 genes showed methylation frequencies of 50% in UC patients which suggests that our sensitive selective markers could detect half of the UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed the methylation status in UC tissues by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the levels of methylation in terms of quantification between UC patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, methylation levels of these 4 genes were found to be significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to UC patients, even though we noted a frequent methylation pattern in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that sensitive DNA methylation markers are able to identify UC patients and this would implicate the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, assessing the methylation of these 4 genes in UC patients could contribute to prevent the progression of severe disease with regular colonoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
