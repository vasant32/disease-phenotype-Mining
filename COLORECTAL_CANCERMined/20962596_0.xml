<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several screening strategies are already in place in various countries, but compliance remains a major issue, mainly due to logistics or discomfort for the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we hypothesized that transcriptional signatures associated with leukocytes in peripheral blood can be informative to the identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was studied using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from whole blood samples collected in PAXgene tubes and DNA microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyzing 119 CRC patients and 101 colonoscopy-negative control (<z:chebi fb="31" ids="48390">CNC</z:chebi>) samples, we observed 327 differentially expressed genes (DEG), mostly associated with immune cell activation and trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Natural Killer (NK) cell signaling and cytotoxicity associated genes appeared to undergo major changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> peripheral blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes were more pronounced in the advanced stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A summarizing score of the expression of 10 genes related to NK cells interestingly revealed a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Stage IV group, suggesting possible further stratification of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study shows the potential of transcriptomics in peripheral blood to discover biomarkers and provides new insight on the immune response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to preparing a possible alternative to current screening modalities, these results also show that the expression analysis of genes like those related to NK cells should allow the stratification of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, opening the door to personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
