<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation testing techniques have therefore become an urgent concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several methods for KRAS mutation detection have been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of these are laboratory developed tests and only a few commercial assays are currently available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the performance characteristics of a KRAS mutation detection assay on the ABI-3130XL genetic analyzer using a new commercial mutation detection kit based on shifted termination assay technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples were analyzed in parallel by different reference laboratories using alternative methodologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various sample types were used including formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, fine-needle aspirates, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> fluid specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high level of agreement (100% correlation for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and fine-needle aspirate samples and 93% correlation for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> fluid specimens) was obtained despite the use of different methodologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Shift termination assay is a simple, robust, and sensitive method for the identification of KRAS mutations in a wide variety of specimen types </plain></SENT>
