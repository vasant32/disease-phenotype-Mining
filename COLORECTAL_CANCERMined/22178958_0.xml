<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of endoscopist in filtering out inappropriate referrals is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicentre, prospective study was performed in which consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy during a 1-month period were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before colonoscopy, the endoscopist assessed appropriateness of the endoscopic referral without directly consulting official guidelines, also collecting clinical and demographic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Appropriateness of the indication was eventually assessed by a group of experts based on the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines, representing the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of the study were the inappropriateness rate and the main related causes, as well as the concordance rate between the endoscopists and the experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of inappropriateness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled in 20 centres, of which 1489 outpatients were included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines, 432 referrals were inappropriate, corresponding to an inappropriateness rate of 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis, prescription of a repeated colonoscopy (â‰¥2 colonoscopies in the same patient) was strongly associated with the inappropriateness of the indication (odds ratio: 8.8; 95% confidence interval: 6.2, 12.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postpolypectomy or post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surveillance accounted for 77% of the inappropriate control procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A 79% concordance rate between endoscopist and expert assessment was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the 317 discordant cases, postpolypectomy or post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surveillance accounted for 51% of the cases, the endoscopists mistakenly classifying it as appropriate in 55% to 61% of the inappropriate cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inappropriateness in outpatient colonoscopy referrals remains high, surveillance procedures representing the most frequent source of inappropriateness </plain></SENT>
