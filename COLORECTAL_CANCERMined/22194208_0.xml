<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two common functional polymorphisms of MTHFR, C677T and A1298C have been associated with several diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We made a case-control study to analyze a possible association of MTHFR gene polymorphisms C677T and A1298C with risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in an eastern Chinese Han population of 137 patients with a confirmed histopathological diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 145 age- and gender-matched controls with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples and the genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> in plasma were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR 677TT genotype had a protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with an odds ratio (OR) = 0.467 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.225-0.966) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 1298CC genotype was significantly correlated with a reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 0.192; 95%CI = 0.040-0.916) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the MTHFR 677CC and MTHFR 1298 AA genotypes, for individuals who carried both MTHFR 677CC and 1298CC genotypes, the OR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 0.103 (95%CI = 0.012-0.900); among individuals who carried both MTHFR 677TT and 1298AC genotypes, the OR for risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 0.169 (95%CI = 0.044-0.654) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MTHFR 677TT+CT genotypes had a significantly lower plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentration than those with the MTHFR 677CC genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MTHFR 1298AC+CC genotypes had a lower plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentration than those with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, subjects with the MTHFR 677TT and MTHFR 1298CC genotypes appeared to have a significantly lower risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MTHFR haplotypes 677CC/1298CC and 677TT/1298AC were less common in cases than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These haplotypes, when compared to the most common haplotype 677CC/1298AA, were associated with a decreased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> level is influenced by MTHFR genotypes </plain></SENT>
