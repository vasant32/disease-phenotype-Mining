<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood-based screening could improve rates of earlier detection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and adenomatous colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of plasma-based detection of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> using array-mediated analysis methylation profiling of 56 genes implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation of 56 genes in patients with Stages I and II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (N=30) and those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> (N=30) were compared with individuals who underwent colonoscopy and were found to have neither adenomatous changes nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Composite biomarkers were developed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and their sensitivity and specificity was estimated using five-fold cross validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six promoters (CYCD2, HIC1, PAX 5, RASSF1A, RB1 and SRBC) were selected for the biomarker, which differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and controls with 84% sensitivity and 68% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three promoters (HIC1, MDG1 and RASSF1A) were selected for the biomarker, which differentiated patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and controls with sensitivity of 55% and specificity of 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylation profiling of plasma DNA can detect early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with significant accuracy and shows promise as a methodology to develop biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
