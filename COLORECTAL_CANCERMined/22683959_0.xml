<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Eligible studies evaluating the correlation between stem cell makers and prognosis were selected based on the references in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included overall survival, relevant pathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses were performed by RevMan 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen eligible articles involving 3098 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis showed CD44 expression is not significant difference of 5-year overall survival rate (OR=0.69, p=0.22) and relevant clinical parameters, such as histological grade (OR=1.98, p=0.06), dukes grade (OR=0.77, p=0.43) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (OR=1.03, p=0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, there is no correlation between CD44v6 and dukes stage (OR=0.56, p=0.23), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (OR= 2.81, p=0.33), except for histological grade (OR=0.48, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, CD44v6 positive cells (OR=0.36, p=0.02) were significantly associated with poor overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on current retrospective evidence, a stem cell maker, CD44 cannot become a prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CD44v6, an isoform of CD44 plays a significant role to predict clinic outcome </plain></SENT>
