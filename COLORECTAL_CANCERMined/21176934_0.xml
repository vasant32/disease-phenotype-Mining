<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: So far, few reports have focused on the clinicopathological features and patterns of recurrence after a complete resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) of colorectal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to show the clinicopathological features of a macroscopically complete resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and the pattern of recurrence after the curative resection of colorectal PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 153 patients with colorectal PC, 31 patients who underwent a complete resection of a synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> of a colorectal PC between 1998 and 2007 were assessed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinicopathological differences were observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, presence of extraperitoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, extent of PC, and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> between a macroscopically complete resection and noncomplete resection patients (P = .045, P &lt; .0001, P &lt; .001, and P = .039, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> recurrence after the complete resection of colorectal PC was observed in 24 patients (77.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate after complete resection was 36.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival rate in the macroscopically complete resection group was higher than in the incomplete resection group (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year intra- and extraperitoneal recurrence survival rates were 63.9% and 33.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant clinicopathological factors affected intraperitoneal recurrence-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a univariate analysis using the log-rank test revealed that extended PC and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> were poor factors affecting extraperitoneal recurrence (P = .009 and P = .023, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 31 patients survived for 5 years after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of the 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> had received a hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the 5-year survival rate after a macroscopically complete resection for colorectal PC approached 36.0%, 77.4% of patients developed intra- and extraperitoneal recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Extended PC and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> were poor factors affecting extraperitoneal recurrence </plain></SENT>
