<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurotoxicity is the main dose-limiting adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No standard treatment for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurotoxicity has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective pilot clinical trial to explore whether neurotropin has neuroprotective effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From May 1, 2010 to May 1, 2011, 80 stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who were eligible to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy voluntarily enrolled in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomly divided into two groups, one of which received neurotropin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients in the control group experienced significantly ≥ grade 2 and ≥ grade 3 neurotoxicity (by NCI CTCAE grading) than those in the neurotropin group (60.9 vs. 21.1 %, for at least grade 2 neurotoxicity, P = 0.001; 39 vs. 2.7 %, for at least grade 3 neurotoxicity, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If neurotoxicity was assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-specific neurotoxicity grading, the patients in the control group also experienced significantly more ≥ grade 2 neurotoxicity (51.2 vs. 12.5 %, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurotropin was the only factor that affected the incidence of ≥ grade 2 neurotoxicity in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neurotropin combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> decreases <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurotoxicity effectively and safely </plain></SENT>
