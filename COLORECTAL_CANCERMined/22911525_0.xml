<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> from 150 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were analyzed for MSI using a fluorescence-based pentaplex polymerase chain reaction technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, we evaluated age, sex, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, localization, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, mucin production, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e> (TIL), and Union for International <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Control stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to the BGrev, and the groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The utility of the BGrev, MsPath, and clinical and histopathological parameters for predicting microsatellite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status were assessed by univariate logistic regression analysis and by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and positive (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative (NPV) predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen out of 45 patients who met and 4 of 105 patients who did not meet the BGrev criteria had MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, and NPV for BGrev were 78.9%, 77%, 30%, and 70%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSI histology (the third BGrev criterion without age limit) was as sensitive as BGrev, but more specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MsPath model was more sensitive than BGrev (86%), with similar specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Any BGrev criterion fulfillment, mucinous differentiation, and right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were singled out as independent factors to identify MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The BGrev, MsPath model, and MSI histology are useful tools for selecting patients for MSI testing </plain></SENT>
