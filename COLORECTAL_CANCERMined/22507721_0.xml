<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Members of the ACPGBI were surveyed using a questionnaire designed to examine surgeon/departmental demographics, type of APER practised, audit of results and complications, opinions regarding extralevator APER (ELAPER) and opinions regarding the potential benefit of a national training programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the survey, 62% of surgeons perform perineal dissection in the supine position and 57% perform a standard APER technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgeons who only practise colorectal surgery (p=0.002) and surgeons performing prone dissection (p&lt;0.0001) are more likely to perform ELAPER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-quarters (76%) audit their results for perineal wound complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 80% audit their oncological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vast majority (94.6%) of those who perform ELAPER believe there is a benefit to this method while 59.6% of those who do not perform ELAPER still believe there is a benefit to ELAPER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 50% feel that there should be a national training programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a distinct discordance with regards to the APER technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among UK colorectal surgeons, although a significant proportion favours ELAPER, there remains a larger proportion still performing standard APER techniques </plain></SENT>
