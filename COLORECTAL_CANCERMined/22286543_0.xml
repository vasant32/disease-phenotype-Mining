<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with a minimum follow-up of 3 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carcinoembryonic antigen was obtained every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for years 3-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years and then yearly for years 3-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was performed at year 1 and then every 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-seven patients were followed for a median of 60 months; 44 patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT was the first sign of recurrence in 68% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carcinoembryonic antigen test was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 20 patients (45%) at the time of disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (57%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> underwent curative-intent resection, 12 of whom are still <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> free at a median follow-up of 81 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, intensive radiographic screening was associated with a high salvage resection rate, which led to favorable clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to define the optimal duration and schedule of radiographic screening in stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
