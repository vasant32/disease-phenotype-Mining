<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Understanding the mechanisms that promote aberrant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell survival is critical for the determination of novel strategies to combat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that the anti-apoptotic protein BAG-1, highly expressed in pre-malignant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue, can potentiate cell survival through regulating NF-κB transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identify a novel complex between BAG-1 and the p50-p50 NF-κB homodimers, implicating BAG-1 as a co-regulator of an atypical NF-κB pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the BAG-1-p50 complex was detected at gene regulatory sequences including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and COX-2 (PTGS2) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suppression of BAG-1 expression using small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was shown to increase EGFR and suppress COX-2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from the NF-κB1 (p105/p50) knock-out mouse were used to demonstrate that p50 expression was required for BAG-1 to suppress EGFR expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was shown to be functionally relevant as attenuation of BAG-1 expression increased ligand activated phosphorylation of EGFR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, this paper identifies a novel role for BAG-1 in modulating gene expression through interaction with the p50-p50 NF-κB complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data presented led us to propose that BAG-1 can act as a selective regulator of p50-p50 NF-κB responsive genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> cells, potentially important for the promotion of cell survival in the context of the fluctuating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As BAG-1 expression is increased in the developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> through to metastatic lesions, understanding the function of the BAG-1-p50 NF-κB complexes may aid in identifying strategies for both the prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
