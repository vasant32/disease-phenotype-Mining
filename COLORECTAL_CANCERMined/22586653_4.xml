<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We produced large xenograft cohorts from 85 patient-derived, genetically characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> samples ("xenopatients") to discover novel determinants of therapeutic response and new oncoprotein targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serially passaged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> retained the morphologic and genomic features of their original counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A validation trial confirmed the robustness of this approach: xenopatients responded to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab with rates and extents analogous to those observed in the clinic and could be prospectively stratified as responders or nonresponders on the basis of several predictive biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype-response correlations indicated HER2 amplification specifically in a subset of cetuximab-resistant, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, HER2 amplification was also enriched in clinically nonresponsive KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A proof-of-concept, multiarm study in HER2-amplified xenopatients revealed that the combined inhibition of HER2 and EGFR induced overt, long-lasting <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest promising therapeutic opportunities in cetuximab-resistant patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, whose medical treatment in the chemorefractory setting remains an unmet clinical need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Direct transfer xenografts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> surgical specimens conserve the interindividual diversity and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> typical of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of origin, combining the flexibility of preclinical analysis with the informative value of population-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our suite of patient-derived xenografts from metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> reliably mimicked disease response in humans, prospectively recapitulated biomarker-based case stratification, and identified HER2 as a predictor of resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies and of response to combination therapies against HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> setting </plain></SENT>
