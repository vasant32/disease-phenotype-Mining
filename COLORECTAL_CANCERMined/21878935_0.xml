<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Benefit finding, PTG, and quality of life were assessed 5 years after diagnosis in a population-based cohort of 483 CRC patients using the benefit finding scale, the post-traumatic growth inventory, and the EORTC QLQ-C30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of BF and PTG, determinants of moderate-to-high BF and PTG, and the association between BF, PTG, and quality of life were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate to high levels of BF and PTG were experienced by 64% and 46% of the survivors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survivors with the highest level of education and with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores reported less BF and PTG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PTG increased with increasing stage and self-reported burden of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quality of life only correlated weakly with PTG (Pearson's r=0.1180, P=0.0112) and not with BF (r=0.0537, P=0.2456) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Many long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors experience BF and PTG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As these constructs were not strongly correlated with quality of life, focusing solely on quality of life after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> misses an important aspect of survivorship </plain></SENT>
