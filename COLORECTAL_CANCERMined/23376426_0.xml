<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the performances of 2 FITs in a population undergoing screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected fecal samples from 19,797 individuals in France (age, 50-74 y) who participated in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening program, from June 2009 through May 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were analyzed using the Magstream (Fujirebio Inc, Tokyo, Japan) and OC Sensor (Eiken Chemical Co, Tokyo, Japan) (2 samples each) FITs, as well as the Hemoccult II guaiac test (SKD, Villepinte, France) (3 samples each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopies were performed for patients with positive results from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cut-off values for levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in buffer and stools were 55 ng/mL and 180 μg/g for the Magstream and 150 ng/mL and 30 μg/g for the OC Sensor, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results from the FITs were compared with those from the guaiac test for cut-off values for stool samples, positivity rates, and the receiver operating characteristic curve values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The numbers needed to screen and the numbers needed to scope to detect an advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> ≥10 mm, or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive test result was found in 1224 participants (6.2%); 1075 (87.8%) underwent a colonoscopy examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 334 were found to have advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering the cut-off values associated with the positivity rate of Hemoccult II (1.6%), the numbers needed to screen were 239 for Hemoccult II, 166 for a 1-sample Magstream FIT, and 129 for a 1-sample OC Sensor FIT; the numbers needed to scope were 3.3, 2.3, and 1.8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the same false-positive rate as Hemoccult II (0.98%), the true-positive rates for Magstream and OC Sensor FITs were 0.65% and 0.90% respectively, compared with 0.42% for Hemoccult II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The OC Sensor FIT had a greater area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value than the Magstream FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on results from a large, population-based study, the OC Sensor FIT identifies patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with greater accuracy than the Magstream FIT </plain></SENT>
