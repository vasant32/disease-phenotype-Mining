<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled in an ancillary pharmacogenetic study of the phase II CETUFTIRI trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of 21 day cycles of cetuximab (day 1-day 8-day 15, 250 mg m(-2) week(-1) following a 400 mg m(-2) initial dose) together with irinotecan (day 1, 250 mg m(-2)) and UFT-folinic acid (days 1-14, 250 mg m(-2) day(-1) UFT, 90 mg day(-1) folinic acid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysed gene polymorphisms (blood DNA) were as follows: EGFR (CA repeats in intron 1, -216G&gt;T, -191C&gt;A), EGF (61A&gt;G), FCGR2A (131Arg&gt;His), FCGR3A (158Phe&gt;Val), <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glycosyltransferase1-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> A1 (TA repeats), TYMS (28 bp repeats, including the G&gt;C mutation on the 3R allele, 6 bp deletion in 3' UTR) and MTHFR (677C&gt;T, 1298A&gt;C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Maximum toxicity grade was linked to EGFR-191C&gt;A polymorphism, with 71.1% grade 3-4 toxicity in CC patients vs. 28.6% in other patients (P= 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A tendency to a better response was observed in patients bearing the TYMS 3RG allele (P= 0.029) and those bearing the FCGR3A 158Val genotype (P= 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The greater the score of favourable TYMS and FCGR3A genotypes, the better the response rate (P= 0.009) and the longer the overall survival (P= 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the score of favourable genotypes was a stronger survival predictor than the performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Present data suggest the importance of FCGR3A 158Phe&gt;Val and TYMS 5' UTR polymorphisms in responsiveness and survival of patients receiving cetuximab-fluoropyrimidine-based therapy </plain></SENT>
