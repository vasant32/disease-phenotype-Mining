<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This phase 2, open-label, single-arm study enrolled patients with unresectable, measurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) after failure of first-line treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received panitumumab 6 mg/kg plus FOLFIRI every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> (RECIST) were performed by the investigators every 8 weeks from weeks 8-32 and every 12 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS status was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficacy endpoints included objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety endpoints included incidence of adverse events (AEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were evaluated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> KRAS status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 116 patients enrolled, 109 patients with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> KRAS status received treatment; 59% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS, and 41% had mutant KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (23%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS and 7 patients (16%) with mutant KRAS had a complete or partial response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 26 weeks (95% CI, 19-33 weeks) and 19 weeks (95% CI, 12-25 weeks) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS and mutant KRAS strata, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median OS was 50 weeks (95% CI, 39-76 weeks) and 31 weeks (95% CI, 23-47 weeks) in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS and mutant KRAS strata, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Skin-related toxicities (86% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (74%) were the most common AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Panitumumab plus FOLFIRI numerically improved objective response rate, PFS, and OS in favor of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The safety profile was consistent with panitumumab plus FOLFIRI trials in similar patient populations </plain></SENT>
