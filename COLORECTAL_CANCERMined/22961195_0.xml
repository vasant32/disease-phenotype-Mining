<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The accurate assessment of the risk factors associated with recurrence in patients with stage II disease is the key to identifying the patients that are most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent guidelines advocate that adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> should take into account factors such as the T stage, number of lymph nodes examined, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to these clinicopathological factors, there has also been intense interest in the identification of new prognostic or predictive biomarkers that can improve outcomes through better patient classification and selection for adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in the field of molecular genetics have led to the identification of specific biomarkers involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression, whereas gene expression microarray technology has led to the identification of molecular profiles able to predict recurrence or benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, none of these has yet been validated in large prospective clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this article, we review the current status of prognostic and predictive biomarkers for stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and provide an update on the most recent developments </plain></SENT>
