<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the role of time perspective in explaining inequalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening attendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested a path model predicting that (a) socioeconomic status (SES) would be associated with consideration of future consequences (CFC), (b) CFC would be associated with perceived benefits/barriers, and (c) barriers and benefits would be associated longitudinally with screening attendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data for these analyses came from the control arm (n = 809) of an intervention to increase screening uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants between 55 and 64 years were offered screening as part of the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flexible Sigmoidoscopy (FS) Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They completed a questionnaire that included demographic and psychological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent screening attendance was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was clear evidence of SES differences in attendance, with 56% in the most deprived tertile attending their FS appointment, compared with 68% in the middle tertile and 71% in the least deprived tertile (p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower SES was associated with lower CFC, higher perceived barriers, and lower perceived benefits (p &lt; .05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher CFC, higher perceived benefits, and lower perceived barriers were associated with attendance (p &lt; .01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CFC mediated the association between SES and perceived benefits/barriers, while perceived benefits/barriers mediated the association between CFC and attendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SES differences in CFC contribute to SES differences in the perceived barriers and benefits of screening, which, in turn, contribute to differences in attendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interventions that take CFC into account, for example, by emphasizing short-term benefits, could promote equality in screening participation </plain></SENT>
