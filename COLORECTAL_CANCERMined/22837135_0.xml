<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 815 patients were referred for colonoscopy and were offered two q-FIT examinations at two different colonoscopy centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified according to the colonoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Test sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were statistically evaluated using one test and two tests at the levels of 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 ng/mL of faecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in those patients with advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimum cut-off test level for clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was determined using one test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The optimum cut-off value of q-FIT OC-Sensor for the detection of clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in our particular population was determined as 75 ng/mL using one test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This value provides an optimum proportion of 73% sensitivity (±95% CI 60.3% - 83.4%) and 90% specificity (±95% CI 86.8% - 92.8%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and NPV were determined as 54.76% and 95.43% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The first step in the implementation of q-FIT test in the screening program in our country is to determine the optimum cut-off level for a population, and to estimate the number of tests performed with respect to the optimum cost effectiveness and economical climate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using one test, the optimum level of q-FIT OC-Sensor® in the Czech Republic was determined as 75 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study could serve as a model for further studies in other countries, where screening does not yet exist </plain></SENT>
