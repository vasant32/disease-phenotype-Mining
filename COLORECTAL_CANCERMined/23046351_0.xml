<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Medline and Embase were searched for articles published before July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cohort studies that evaluated incidence and mortality of DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial search identified 1887 titles, of which 24 articles met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We defined the relative risk (RR) as the metric of choice; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an increase in the RR of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in persons with DM compared with those without DM (RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.19-1.39), without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies (P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between duration of DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence was stronger in the 11-15-year group (RR 1.51; 95% CI 1.12-2.03) than in the &lt;10-year group (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.90-1.22) and the &gt;15-year group (RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.80-1.94), and there was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among subgroups (P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In studies reporting standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), there was an increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with DM (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.14-1.42; P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) = 0.09), and the association was stronger among men (RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.15-1.86) than women (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.00-1.17); there was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among gender (P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that individuals with DM have a significant increase in risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
