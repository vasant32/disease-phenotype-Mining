<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, new drugs and modern combination chemotherapy regimens, together with the improvement of surgical techniques, allow a potentially curative approach in an increasing number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there is no strong evidence for an optimal treatment strategy for CRCLMs, mainly because of the extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, results from different studies in this setting may be difficult to interpret, also because the definitions of different patient subgroups are unclear and overlapping </plain></SENT>
