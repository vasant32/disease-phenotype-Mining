<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although our earlier videos demonstrated extrahepatic control of the hepatic arterial, portal venous, and biliary system, we have begun transecting the biliary system intraparenchymally for lesions distant from hilar plate and the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts.1 (-) 3 METHODS: The patient was a 50-year old gentleman with synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e>, who underwent 6 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a Folfox-based regimen followed by laparoscopic right hepatectomy plus wedge resection of segment 4 and microwave ablation for a lesion in segment 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was followed 1 month later by laparoscopic proctocolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of note, the patient was also treated with Avastin for 1 month, which was stopped 2 months prior to his liver surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">Pneumoperitoneum</z:e> was obtained with the Veress needed; alternatively, the open technique may need to be used in patients who have undergone previous surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 12-mm blunt tip balloon trocar was placed approximately 1 hand-breadth below the right costal margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two 12-mm working trocars were placed to the left and right of this optic trocar, and trocars were then placed in the left sub xiphoid region and in the right flank for the assistants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The right hepatic artery was triply clipped proximally and twice distally prior to being sharply transected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The right hepatic portal vein was then transected using a laparoscopic vascular GIA stapler device (TriStapler, Covidien, Norwalk, CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anterior surface of the liver was examined, and there was a clear line of demarcation along Cantlie's line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the ultrasonic shears (Harmonic Scalpel, Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH), the liver parenchyma was then transected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the area of the right hepatic duct, the liver parenchyma was transected with a single firing of the laparoscopic GIA vascular stapler device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The right hepatic vein was then identified and similarly transected with a single firing of the laparoscopic vascular GIA stapler device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hemostasis along the hepatic parenchyma was reinforced with the laparoscopic bipolar device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The two trocars on the right of the patient are connected into 1 incision, and a gel port is placed to facilitate removal of the specimen; alternatively, an old incision can be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For patients who will need a laparoscopic or open colectomy, a lower midline incision is made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From Jan 2009 to Oct 2010, 13 patients underwent right hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The average age was 63.5 years (range, 46-87 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The indication for surgery were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> including 11 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, 1 anal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In these 13 patients, 1 patient (7.7%) required conversion to an open approach because of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, 1 additional patient required laparoscopic hand assistance, and the remaining patients were completed laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There were no surgical mortalities at 30 or 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 2 (15%) patients, and included 1 patient who was converted to an open procedure because of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and was complicated by a bile leak; the second patient with complication also developed a 1-bile leak, both of which responded to percutaneous treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay was 7.7 days (range, 5-17 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The mean operative time was 401 min (range, 220-600 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The mean estimated blood loss was 878 cm(3) (range, 100-3,000 cm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent an R0 resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Laparoscopic major hepatectomy is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As in open hepatectomies, intrahepatic transection of the right bile duct may be safer because there is a decreased risk of injury to the left hepatic duct.4 (,) 5 Larger series with longer-term follow-up are necessary </plain></SENT>
