<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has prognostic value in patients with a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many chemotherapeutic trial databases hold information on white cell and neutrophil counts only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the prognostic value of the NLR with a derived score (dNLR), composed of white cell and neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=27,031) who were sampled incidentally between 2000 and 2007 for neutrophil, lymphocyte and white cell counts, and also had a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (Scottish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry), were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of this group, 12,118 patients who had been sampled within 2 years of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On follow-up, there were 7366 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, of which 6198 (84%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time from blood sampling to diagnosis was 2.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival was 0.650 for the NLR and 0.640 for the dNLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The NLR and dNLR were independently associated with survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> studied (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The optimal thresholds, on the basis of hazard ratios and area under the curve, were 4 : 1 for the NLR and 2 : 1 for the dNLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that the dNLR has similar prognostic value to the NLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the universally available dNLR is to be commended for use in the risk stratification of patients undergoing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
