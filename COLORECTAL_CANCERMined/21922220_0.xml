<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimizing fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is integral to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in health care systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this study was to characterize the utilization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing in a large integrated health care system (VHA), determine current rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing by FOBT and examine factors associated with lack of FOBT card return </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The VHA Office of Quality and Performance (OQP) collected data from a national sample of Veterans from October 2008 to September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates and modality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing for eligible Veterans were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among those offered FOBT, bivariate analyses were performed to describe population characteristics by FOBT return </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to determine factors independently associated with lack of FOBT return </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 36,336 Veterans were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On weighted analysis, 80.4% of Veterans received a form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority underwent colonoscopy in the prior 10 years (71.6%), followed by FOBT in the prior year (24.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 31.0% did not return FOBT cards that were provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with a lack of FOBT return included: younger age, female gender, non-Caucasian race, living in the Northeast, current smoking and lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in VHA are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Systems-based practices within VHA likely play a role in successful <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is most often via colonoscopy, followed by FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Characteristics associated with non-adherence with FOBT may inform future quality improvement initiatives in health care systems </plain></SENT>
