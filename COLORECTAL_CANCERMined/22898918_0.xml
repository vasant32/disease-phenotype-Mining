<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: No previous prospective US study has examined whether the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is disproportionately high in low socioeconomic status (SES) populations of both men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the relationship between both individual and area-level SES and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence, overall and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from the ongoing prospective National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study of persons (50-71 years old) who resided in 6 US states and 2 metropolitan areas at baseline in 1995-1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were ascertained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> registries through December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SES was measured by self-reported education and census-tract socioeconomic deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline and follow-up questionnaires collected detailed information on individual-level <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors including family history and health behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 506,488 participants analyzed, 7676 were diagnosed with primary invasive colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>: 44.6% [corrected] in the right colon, 26.7% in the left colon, and 25.9% in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was significantly higher among people who had low educational level or lived in low-SES neighborhoods, relative to respective highest-SES groups, even after accounting for other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were stronger in the rectum than in left or right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the right colon, there were no significant SES differences by either SES measure after accounting for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SES, assessed by either individual-level education or neighborhood measures, was associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> even after accounting for other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relationship between SES and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was strongest in the rectum and weakest in the right colon </plain></SENT>
