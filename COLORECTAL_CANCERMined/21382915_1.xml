<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several European governments have recently mandated price cuts in drugs to reduce health care spending </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, such measures without supportive evidence may compromise patient care because manufacturers may withdraw current products or not launch new agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A value-based pricing scheme may be a better approach for determining a fair drug price and may be a medium for negotiations between the key stakeholders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate this approach, pharmacoeconomic (PE) modeling was used from the Spanish health care system perspective to estimate a value-based price for bevacizumab, a drug that provides a 1.4-month survival benefit to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The threshold used for economic value was three times the Spanish per capita GDP, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A PE model was developed to simulate outcomes in mCRC patients receiving chemotherapy ± bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained from randomized trials and costs from a Spanish hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Utility estimates were determined by interviewing 24 Spanish <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> nurses and pharmacists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A price per dose of bevacizumab was then estimated using a target threshold of € 78,300 per quality-adjusted life year gained, which is three times the Spanish per capita GDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For a 1.4-month survival benefit, a price of € 342 per dose would be considered cost effective from the Spanish public health care perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The price may be increased to € 733 or € 843 per dose if the drug were able to improve patient quality of life or enhance survival from 1.4 to 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a value-based pricing approach using PE modeling and the WHO criteria for economic value is feasible and perhaps a better alternative to government mandated price cuts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The former approach would be a good starting point for opening dialog between European government payers and the pharmaceutical industry </plain></SENT>
