<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The higher expression and secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and their autocrine and paracrine functions play an important role in the activation of transcription factors, which in turn promote <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NF-κB serves as a vital biomolecule that transcribes a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-apoptotic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pro-inflammatory cytokines can also activate Jak3/Stat3 signaling pathways, thereby increasing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the expression of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IFNγ, TNF-α, iNOS, COX-2, Jak3, Stat3 and NF-κB were increased in the early stages of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased expression of these inflammatory molecules was reversed by the simultaneous administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anti-inflammatory activity of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> was found to be mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB (p65) DNA-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-neoplastic end effect of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> in the isolated colonocytes was demonstrated by an increased level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> inhibit NF-κB and Jak3/Stat3 signaling and down-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines to a level that inhibits <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
