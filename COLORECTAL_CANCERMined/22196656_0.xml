<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare short- and long-term outcomes after surgery between younger and elderly patients at a single nonteaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 342 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection for invasive primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between April 1999 and April 2007 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to their age at the time of surgery, those younger than 79 years of age (n = 283) and those older than 80 years of age (n = 59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of elderly patients had concurrent disease before surgery, right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model (multivariate analysis) identified three independent risk factors for a poor outcome after surgery (excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by other causes): 1) the presence of preoperative symptoms; 2) noncurative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; and 3) the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age older than 80 years was not a risk factor for a poor postoperative prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At our nonteaching hospital, surgical resection appears to be a safe and beneficial treatment option for elderly patients (older than 80 years of age) who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
