<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of several types of sialylation of glycoconjugates was investigated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue specimens obtained from 65 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>-binding lectins from Maackia amurensis (MAM), Sambucus sieboldiana (SSA), Maackia amurensis agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) and monoclonal antibodies, and compared with their clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> tissue specimens from 44.6% of patients had positive staining with MAM, which recognized α2,3sialylated type 2 chain (NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAcβR) structures, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa showed only weak staining with MAM was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> and lymphatic invasion were seen in patients with positive staining with MAM (P &lt; 0.01), while not with other lectins or antibodies that recognized sialylated glycoconjugates or sialyl Lewis-related antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The five-year survival rate of patients with MAM-positive staining was significantly lower than that with MAM-negative staining when including T0-1 cases, but there was no difference in cases with T2-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the patients' survival rates when the tissues were stained with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>, SSA or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> lectins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: α2,3Sialylated type 2 chain structures were predominantly expressed in colorectal tissues associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e>, in particular, with lymphatic spread of distal colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
