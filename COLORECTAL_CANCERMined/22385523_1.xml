<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Texture analysis based on local binary patterns (LBP) has previously been used successfully in applications such as face recognition and industrial machine vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> with tissue samples from 643 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were digitized using a whole slide scanner and areas representing epithelium and stroma were annotated in the images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Well-defined images of epithelium (n = 41) and stroma (n = 39) were used for training a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with LBP texture features and a contrast measure C (LBP/C) as input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We optimized the classifier on a validation set (n = 576) and then assessed its performance on an independent test set of images (n = 720) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the performance of the LBP/C classifier was evaluated against classifiers based on Haralick texture features and Gabor filtered images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proposed approach using LPB/C texture features was able to correctly differentiate epithelium from stroma according to texture: the agreement between the classifier and the human observer was 97 per cent (kappa value = 0.934, P &lt; 0.0001) and the accuracy (area under the ROC curve) of the LBP/C classifier was 0.995 (CI95% 0.991-0.998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the corresponding classifiers based on Haralick features and Gabor-filter images were 0.976 and 0.981 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The method illustrates the capability of automated segmentation of epithelial and stromal tissue in <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> based on texture features and an SVM classifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Applications include tissue specific assessment of gene and protein expression, as well as computerized analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
