<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The present study investigated the levels of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) in relation to third-line treatment with cetuximab and irinotecan and the quantitative relationship of cfDNA with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific mutations in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Inclusion criteria were histopathologically verified chemotherapy-resistant mCRC, adequate Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status, and organ function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of irinotecan being administered at 350 mg/m(2) for 3 weeks and weekly administration of 250 mg/m(2) cetuximab until progression or unacceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A quantitative PCR method was developed to assess the number of cfDNA alleles and KRAS and BRAF mutation alleles in plasma at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 108 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only three patients were positive for BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of KRAS mutations detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were also found in the plasma [32 of 41 (78%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma cfDNA and plasma mutant KRAS levels (pmKRAS) were strongly correlated (r = 0.85, P &lt; 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disease control rate was 77% in patients with low cfDNA (&lt;25% quartile) and 30% in patients with high cfDNA [&gt;75% quartile (P = 0.009)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with pmKRAS levels higher than 75% had a disease control rate of 0% compared with 42% in patients with lower pmKRAS (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cox analysis confirmed the prognostic importance of both cfDNA and pmKRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High levels were clear indicators of a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KRAS analysis in plasma is a viable alternative to tissue analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Quantitative levels of cfDNA and pmKRAS are strongly correlated and hold promise of clinical application </plain></SENT>
