<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Few data have been published on the performance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screens that use multiple rounds of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated outcomes of 4 screening rounds in over 7 years in an Italian population-based program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 2959 average-risk subjects, aged 50-74 years, who were invited for the first screening round in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the participation rate, the yield of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detected in the screening examinations, and we collected information about interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, with a follow-up period of 8.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participation in each round varied from 56% to 63%; 48.1% of eligible subjects attended <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 invitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of the FIT for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>) was 40% at the first round, and approximately 33% in the subsequent rounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This decrease was attributable mainly to a decrease in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, although a high rate of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (range, 0.8%-1.7%) was observed over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To find one advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the study period the number of people that needed to be screened was 28, and the number of tests needed was 74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: About 60% of invited individuals participated in every single round of FIT screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but less than 50% attended <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high detection rate of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rounds indicates that FIT screening could have a higher impact on incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than the guaiac fecal occult blood test </plain></SENT>
