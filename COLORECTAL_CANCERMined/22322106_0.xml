<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Linear accelerators operating at or above 10 MV produce <z:chebi fb="112" ids="30222">neutrons</z:chebi> by photonuclear reactions and induce activation in machine components, which are a source of potential exposure for radiation therapists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study estimated gamma dose contributions to radiation therapists during high energy, whole pelvic, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> beam treatments and determined the optimum room entry times, in terms of safety of radiation therapists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two types of technique (anterior-posterior opposing and 3-field technique) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An Elekta Precise treatment system, operating up to 18 MV, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements with an area monitoring device (a Mini 900R radiation monitor) were performed, to calculate gamma dose rates around the radiotherapy facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements inside the treatment room were performed when the linear accelerator was in use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The doses received by radiation therapists were estimated, and optimum room entry times were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest gamma dose rates were approximately 7 μSv/h inside the treatment room, while the doses in the control room were close to background (~0 μSv/h) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest personal dose received by radiation therapists was estimated at 5 mSv/yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To optimize protection, radiation therapists should wait for up to11 min after beam-off prior to room entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The potential risks to radiation therapists with standard safety procedures were well below internationally recommended values, but risks could be further decreased by delaying room entry times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dependent on the technique used, optimum entry times ranged between 7 to 11 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A balance between moderate treatment times versus reduction in measured equivalent doses should be considered </plain></SENT>
