<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: While moderate-vigorous intensity physical activities (MVPA) confer the greatest health benefits, evidence suggests that light-intensity activities are also beneficial, particularly for older adults and individuals with moderate-severe comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between light-intensity physical activity and physical function were examined in elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors, who are at increased risk for age- and treatment related comorbidities, including accelerated functional decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The analysis included 641 breast, prostate, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors (54% female) aged 65 and older who participated in a 1-year, home-based diet and exercise intervention designed to reduce the rate of physical function decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-intervention physical activity and function were assessed via the CHAMPS questionnaire, the SF-36 physical function subscale (PFS) and the Late Life Function and Disability Index basic and advanced lower-extremity function (LEF) subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANCOVA was used to compare means of physical function across levels of PA intensity (low-light (LLPA): 1.0-2.0 METs; high-light (HLPA): 2.1-2.9 METs; MVPA: â‰¥3.0 METs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, comorbidities, symptoms, and MVPA, increasing tertiles of baseline light-intensity activity were associated with higher scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 measures of baseline physical function (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p-values &lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations were stronger for HLPA than for LLPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with survivors who decreased or remained stable in MVPA and HLPA at the post-intervention follow-up, those who increased in HLPA, but not MVPA, reported higher physical function scores (LSMeans (95% CI): SF-36 PFS: -5.58 (-7.96, -3.20) vs. -2.54 (-5.83, 0.75), p = 0.14; basic LEF: -2.00 (-3.45, -0.55) vs. 0.28 (-1.72, 2.28), p = 0.07; advanced LEF: -2.58 (-4.00, -1.15) vs. 0.44 (-1.52, 2.40), p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that increasing light-intensity activities, especially HLPA, may be a viable approach to reducing the rate of physical function decline in individuals who are unable or reluctant to initiate or maintain adequate levels of moderate-intensity activities </plain></SENT>
