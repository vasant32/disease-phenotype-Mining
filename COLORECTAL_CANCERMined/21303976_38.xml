<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we systematically analyzed the balance between cytotoxic T cells and different subsets of helper T cells in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and we correlated their impact on disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A panel of immune related genes were analyzed in 125 frozen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infiltrating cytotoxic T cells, Treg, Th1, and Th17 cells were also quantified in the center and the invasive margin of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By hierarchical clustering of a correlation matrix we identified functional clusters of genes associated with Th17 (RORC, IL17A), Th2 (IL4, IL5, IL13), Th1 (Tbet, IRF1, IL12Rb2, STAT4), and cytotoxicity (GNLY, GZMB, PRF1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with high expression of the Th17 cluster had a poor prognosis, whereas patients with high expression of the Th1 cluster had prolonged disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the Th2 clusters were predictive of prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined analysis of cytotoxic/Th1 and Th17 clusters improved the ability to discriminate relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In situ analysis of the density of IL17+ cells and CD8+ cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues confirmed the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings argue that functional Th1 and Th17 clusters yield opposite effects on patient survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and they provide complementary information that may improve prognosis </plain></SENT>
