<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent reports from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening trials in high-risk populations suggest that autoantibodies can be detected before clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is minimal data on the role of autoantibody signatures in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Informative p53 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were identified in sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using an autoantibody microarray with 15-mer overlapping <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> covering the complete p53 sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The selected <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were evaluated in a blinded case-control study using stored serum from the multimodal arm of the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ovarian Cancer</z:e> Screening where women gave annual blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were postmenopausal women who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> following recruitment, with 2 or more serum samples preceding diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controls were age-matched women with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 50 640 women randomised to the multimodal group were followed up for a median of 6.8 (inter-quartile range 5.9-8.4) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> notification was received in 101 women with serial samples of whom 97 (297 samples) had given consent for secondary studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were matched 1 : 1 with 97 controls (296 serial samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The four most informative <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> identified 25.8% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with a specificity of 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median lead time was 1.4 (range 0.12-3.8) years before clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in the general population, autoantibody signatures are detectable during preclinical disease and may be of value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in particular, where the current need is to improve compliance, it suggests that p53 autoantibodies may contribute towards risk stratification </plain></SENT>
