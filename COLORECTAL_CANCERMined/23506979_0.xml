<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The backbone of current cytotoxic treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) consists of a fluoropyrimidine together with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX/FOLFOX) or irinotecan (XELIRI/FOLFIRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With an overall objective response rate of approximately 50% for either treatment combination, a major unsolved problem is that no predictors of response to these treatments are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we profiled 742 microRNAs in laser-capture microdissected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells from responding and non-responding patients receiving XELOX/FOLFOX as first-line treatment for mCRC, and identified, among others, high expression of miR-625-3p, miR-181b and miR-27b to be associated with poor clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a validation cohort of 94 mCRC patients treated first-line with XELOX, high expression of miR-625-3p was confirmed to be associated with poor response (OR = 6.25, 95%CI [1.8; 21.0]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent analyses showed that miR-625-3p was not dysregulated between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples, nor was its expression associated with recurrence of stage II or III disease, indicating that miR-625-3p solely is a response marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we also found that these miRNAs were up-regulated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> resistant HCT116/oxPt (miR-625-3p, miR-181b and miR-27b) and LoVo/oxPt (miR-181b) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines as compared with their isogenic parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our results suggest an association between miR-625-3p and response to first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> based chemotherapy of mCRC </plain></SENT>
