<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (CapeOX) is one of the reference doublet cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of CapeOX with that of S-1 plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (SOX), a promising alternative treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this open-label, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients (1:1) from 11 institutions in South Korea to receive either CapeOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 130 mg/m(2) on day 1) or SOX (S-1 40 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 130 mg/m(2) on day 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks and continued for as many as nine cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy, except in instances of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a patient's refusal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maintenance chemotherapy with S-1 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> was allowed after discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence (stratified by primary sites, previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment, and the presence of measurable lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was to show non-inferiority of SOX relative to CapeOX in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary analysis was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00677443 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Between May 14, 2008, and Sept 23, 2009, we randomly assigned 168 patients to receive SOX and 172 to receive CapeOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 8·5 months (95% CI 7·6-9·3) in the SOX group and 6·7 months (6·2-7·1) in the CapeOX group (hazard ratio, 0·79 [95% CI 0·60-1·04]; p(non-inferiority)&lt;0·0001, p(log-rank)=0·09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The upper limit of the CI was below the predefined margin of 1·43, showing the non-inferiority of SOX to CapeOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We recorded a higher incidence of grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (49 [29%] vs 24 [15%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (37 [22%] vs 11 [7%]), and diarrhoea (16 [10%] vs seven [4%]) in the SOX group than in the CapeOX group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The frequency of any grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e> was greater in the CapeOX group than it was in the SOX group (51 [31%] vs 23 [14%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The SOX regimen could be an alternative first-line doublet chemotherapy strategy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is needed to explore its potential when used together with other targeted agents or as adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
