<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The study aimed to investigate whether narrow-band imaging (NBI) can enhance <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection in patients at high risk for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> compared with high-definition white-light endoscopy (WLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High risk was defined as three or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at last colonoscopy, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and positive faecal occult blood test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Two hundred and fourteen patients were randomized 1:1 to examination with NBI or WLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, nonadenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and patients with three or five or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A post hoc analysis to examine the effect of endoscopist and bowel preparation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>: NBI 73%vs WLE 66%, odds ratio 1.40 (95% CI 0.78-2.52), P = 0.26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference for any secondary outcome measure except for the number of flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> which was significantly greater with NBI [comparison ratio 2.66 (95% CI 1.52-4.63), P = 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post hoc analysis indicated that one of three endoscopists performed significantly better for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection with NBI than WLE [comparison ratio 1.92 (95% CI 1.07-3.44), P = 0.03] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Good bowel preparation was associated with significantly improved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection with NBI [comparison ratio 1.55 (95% CI 1.01-2.22), P = 0.04] but not with fair preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall NBI did not improve detection compared with WLE in a group of patients at high risk for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, but specific subgroups might benefit </plain></SENT>
