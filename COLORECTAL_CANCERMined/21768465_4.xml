<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Health-related QoL was assessed 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis in a population-based cohort starting with 439 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from Saarland, Germany, using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QoL after 5 and 10 years and time course of QoL during the 10 years after diagnosis were compared with controls from the general population of Germany, after controlling for sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 234 and 196 patients were still alive after 5 and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these survivors, 178 (76%) responded in the 5-year follow-up, 133 (68%) in the 10-year follow-up, and 117 (60%) participated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follow-ups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the entire follow-up, younger survivors (age at diagnosis, &lt; 60 years) reported restrictions in role, social, emotional, and cognitive functioning and specific problems like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Older survivors (age at diagnosis, â‰¥ 70 years) reported comparable or even better QoL than controls within the first 3 to 5 years after diagnosis and comparable to worse QoL 5 to 10 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although younger survivors continuously reported detriments in various QoL dimensions during the 10-year period after diagnosis, detriments in older survivors became apparent in the long run only </plain></SENT>
