<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment side effects, together with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> symptoms, can result in a 'symptom burden' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the patient's burden during chemotherapy treatment and plan effective symptom relief there is a need for more knowledge about the experience of symptoms from the patients' perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to qualitatively identify and describe the most common symptoms among patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and discover whether there are barriers to reporting symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen Swedish patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and treated with chemotherapy were interviewed face-to-face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transcripts were analysed by following the principles of qualitative content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine symptoms/forms of distress were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those most frequently expressed were <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, changed bowel habits, and affected mental well-being, closely followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, loss of appetite and neurological problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of particular note were the affected mental well-being, the magnitude of the neurological problems described, the symptoms related to skin and mucous membrane problems, and the reports of distressing pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Barriers to symptom control were only expressed by the patients in passing and very vaguely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms other reports on most common symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It also highlights the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and provides data on less well-studied issues that warrant further study, namely affected mental well-being, the magnitude of the neurological problems and symptoms related to the skin and mucous membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nurses need to be sensitive to the patients' need presented and not only noting symptoms/distresses they have guidelines for </plain></SENT>
