<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2007 to October 2010, 37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> manifesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complete mechanical obstruction were treated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> tube drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After irrigation and drainage ranging from 4 to 10 days, the radical operations and anastomosis were performed by laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The drainage tubes were successfully implanted in 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decompression time of patients was (5.8 ± 1.6) d, ranging from 4 to 10 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp> symptoms were faded away after (3.8 ± 1.3) d (1 to 7 d) drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And comparing to that of patients when admission, abdominal circumference significantly reduced from (92 ± 7) cm to (84 ± 6) cm (P = 0.013) before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one cases were performed radical resection and anastomosis by laparoscopy after decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative recovery was smooth, and there was no serious complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery followed decompression by transanal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> tube is effective and safe for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lower colorectal obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery may be converted to limit surgery by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After appropriate bowel preparation, laparoscopic radical surgery and anastomosis is feasible </plain></SENT>
