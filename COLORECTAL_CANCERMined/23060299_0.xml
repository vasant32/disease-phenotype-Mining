<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 25 surgically removed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three sets of samples were collected readily after removal and exposed to 0, 30, and 60 minutes of delay of fixation or freezing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each set of the samples, HIF-1α gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, protein concentration of HIF-1α was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and IHC staining of HIF-1α, GLUT-1, Bcl-2, and Ki-67 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies and whole sections of the entire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were analyzed by IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the HIF-1α gene expression, HIF-1α protein concentration, and IHC expression of HIF-1α, GLUT-1, Ki-67, and Bcl-2 were not systematically affected by either the fixation or freezing delay of the tissue, the perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time, or the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time (perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>+delay of fixation or freezing) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the intraindividual variation was quite large, which may question the use of individually, non-standardized-handled single biopsies or small tissue samples for analysis of often rather heterogenously expressed biomarkers </plain></SENT>
