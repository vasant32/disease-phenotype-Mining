<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are a highly desirable resource for epigenetic studies, but there is no suitable platform to assay genome-wide methylation in these widely available resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, Thirlwell et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2010) have reported a modified ligation-based DNA repair protocol to prepare FFPE DNA for the Infinium methylation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have tested the accuracy of methylation data obtained with this modification by comparing paired fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE colon tissue (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report locus-specific correlation and concordance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific differentially methylated loci (DML), both of which were not previously assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used Illumina's Infinium Methylation 27K chip for 12 pairs of FF and 12 pairs of FFPE tissue from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and surrounding healthy tissue from the resected colon of the same individual, after repairing the FFPE DNA using Thirlwell's modified protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, overall correlation of β values between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loci in paired FF and FFPE was comparable to previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue storage type (FF or FFPE) was found to be the most significant source of variation rather than tissue type (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a large number of DML between FF and FFPE DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using ANOVA, we also identified DML in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue in both FF and FFPE samples, and out of the top 50 loci in both groups only 7 were common, indicating poor concordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Likewise, while looking at the correlation of individual loci between FFPE and FF across the patients, less than 10% of loci showed strong correlation (r ≥ 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, we checked the effect of the ligation-based modification on the Infinium chemistry for SNP genotyping on an independent set of samples, which also showed poor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ligation of FFPE DNA prior to the Infinium genome-wide methylation assay may detect a reasonable number of loci, but the numbers of detected loci are much fewer than in FF samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the concordance of DML detected between FF and FFPE DNA is suboptimal, and DML from FFPE tissues should be interpreted with great caution </plain></SENT>
