<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in a series of patients undergoing liver resection after portal vein embolization (PVE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The regenerative response after PVE leading to compensatory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the nonembolized liver segments potentially enhances <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Portal vein embolization was performed in 28 patients diagnosed with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> between 2004 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> volume was measured by computed tomography (CT) volumetry before and after PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor growth</z:e> rate (TGR) was measured by CT volumetry and compared with that of a non-PVE control group with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> of whom 30 had 2 CT scans preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the future remnant liver (FRL) after PVE and after resection were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median TGR of PVE patients was 0.53 mL/d (interquartile range [IQR], 0.02-1.88) versus 0.09 mL/d (IQR, -0.04 to 0.40; P = 0.03) in non-PVE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TGR was 0.15 (IQR, -0.52 to 0.66) mL/d before PVE and 0.85 (IQR, -0.10 to 1.62) mL/d after PVE in the same patients (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (25%) showed new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lesions in the FRL after PVE, of whom 3 patients (11%) were not resectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients (8 of 19; 42%) after PVE also showed a higher rate of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in the remnant liver at follow-up than non-PVE patients (1 of 28; 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly better for non-PVE patients, with a 3-year survival rate of 77% versus 26% in patients undergoing PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Portal vein embolization is associated with increased TGR and new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the FRL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumor</z:e> after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Short intervals and interval chemotherapy between PVE and resection are, therefore, advised </plain></SENT>
