<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed continued use of bevacizumab plus standard second-line chemotherapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> progressing after standard first-line bevacizumab-based treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an open-label, phase 3 study in 220 centres in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, patients (aged ≥18 years) with unresectable, histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> progressing up to 3 months after discontinuing first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to second-line chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab 2·5 mg/kg per week equivalent (either 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 7·5 mg/kg every 3 weeks, intravenously) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The choice between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based or irinotecan-based second-line chemotherapy depended on the first-line regimen (switch of chemotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A combination of a permuted block design and the Pocock and Simon minimisation algorithm was used for the randomisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00700102 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2006, and June 9, 2010, 409 (50%) patients were assigned to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 411 (50%) to chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 11·1 months (IQR 6·4-15·6) in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group and 9·6 months (5·4-13·9) in the chemotherapy alone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 11·2 months (95% CI 10·4-12·2) for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 9·8 months (8·9-10·7) for chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0·81, 95% CI 0·69-0·94; unstratified log-rank test p=0·0062) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-5 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or haemorrhage (eight [2%] vs one [&lt;1%]), gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (seven [2%] vs three [&lt;1%]), and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolisms</z:hpo> (19 [5%] vs 12 [3%]) were more common in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy alone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported grade 3-5 adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (65 [16%] in the bevacizumab and chemotherapy group vs 52 [13%] in the chemotherapy alone group), diarrhoea (40 [10%] vs 34 [8%], respectively), and asthenia (23 [6%] vs 17 [4%], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported for four patients in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group and three in the chemotherapy alone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Maintenance of VEGF inhibition with bevacizumab plus standard second-line chemotherapy beyond disease progression has clinical benefits in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This approach is also being investigated in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types, including metastatic breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
