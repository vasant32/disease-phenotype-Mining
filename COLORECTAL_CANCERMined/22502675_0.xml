<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six hundred and eleven (611) cases afflicted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 1,362 controls drawn from the same hospitals in the same time period were analyzed through unconditional multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This base population was submitted to a principal components factor analysis and three factors were retained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were labeled as the meat-based, plant-based, and carbohydrates patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were rotated using orthogonal varimax method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest risk was positively associated with the meat-based pattern (OR for the highest quartile versus the lowest one 1.63, 95 % CI 1.22-2.18, P value for trend = 0.001), whereas the plant-based pattern was strongly protective (OR 0.60, 95 % CI 0.45-0.81, P value for trend &lt;0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The carbohydrates pattern was only positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk (OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.02-2.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The meat-based pattern was rich in saturated fat, animal protein, cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi>, nutrients originated in red meat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since herocyclic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> are formed in the well-done red meat through the action of amino acids and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>, it is suggestive that this pattern could be an important etiologic agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
