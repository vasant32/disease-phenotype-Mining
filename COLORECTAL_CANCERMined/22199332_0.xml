<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine how <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> plus infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin (FOLFOX) and irinotecan plus infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) affect Tregs and other immune effectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 27 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> received the FOLFOX (n=17) or FOLFIRI (n=10) chemotherapeutic regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected from patients before and 7 days after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Tregs co-expressing CD4(+)FoxP3(+) was analyzed with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage and the number of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs were significantly reduced after FOLFOX and FOLFIRI in the patients who had high levels of Tregs before chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the total number of lymphocytes and the population of CD4(+) T lymphocytes were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FOLFOX and FOLFIRI may enhance antitumor immunity via suppression of Tregs </plain></SENT>
