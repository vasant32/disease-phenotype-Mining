<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Blood-borne biomarkers have great potential in diagnostic medicine, but low concentrations, inability to determine their source and lack of a patient baseline have limited their success in both research and clinical medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>D'Souza etÂ al. previously demonstrated that ultrasound-induced sonoporation can be used to liberate protein biomarkers from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> into the surrounding serum, overcoming many of the limitations of blood-borne biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we build on D'Souza's work, extending this technique to nucleic acids, specifically mammaglobin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-a potential diagnostic biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we propose to use ultrasound contrast agents, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-stabilized microbubbles, to enhance the effects of sonoporation and further amplify the biomarker levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that microbubbles can enhance mammaglobin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels by two to three orders of magnitude greater than background levels and one to two orders of magnitude greater than ultrasound alone </plain></SENT>
