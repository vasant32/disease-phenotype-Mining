<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimal management requires realistic assessment of treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study's purpose is to characterize outcomes following palliative intervention for MBO in the setting of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of a prospective palliative database identified 141 patients undergoing surgical (OR; n = 96) or endoscopic (GI; n = 45) procedures for symptoms of MBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median patient age was 58 years, median follow-up 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most (63%) had multiple sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinomatosis</z:e> (p = 0.002), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> (p = 0.05), and multifocal obstruction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinomatosis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) significantly predicted the need for percutaneous or open gastrostomy tube, or stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedure-associated morbidity for 81 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small bowel obstruction</z:e> (SBO) was 37%; 7% developed an enterocutaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>/anastomotic leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most (84%) patients were palliated successfully; some received additional chemotherapy (38%) or surgery (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Procedure-associated morbidity for 60 patients with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> (LBO) was 25%; 11 patients (18%) required other procedures for stent failure, with one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptom resolution was &gt;97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with LBO had improved symptom resolution, shorter length of stay (LOS), and longer median survival than patients with SBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MBO and stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were successfully palliated with GI or OR procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with CT-identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinomatosis</z:e>, or multifocal obstruction were least likely to benefit from OR procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CT plays an important role in preoperative planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Sound clinical judgment and improved understanding are required for optimal management of MBO </plain></SENT>
