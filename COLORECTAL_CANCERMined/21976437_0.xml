<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marginally significant associations were found both for hsa-miR-149 rs2292832 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> risk (TC + CC vs. TT, OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.44-1.04) and for hsa-miR-605 rs2043556 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (AG + GG vs. AA, OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.48-1.02) in males </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>Irritability</z:hpo> was found to be a risk factor for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02-2.53) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.17-3.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among those that engaged in smoke inhalation, miR-149 CT/CC and miR-605 AG/GG genotype carriers had increased susceptibilities to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.11-3.25) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (OR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.03-3.42), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the tea drinkers, there exists a marginally protective effect of miR-605 AG/GG genotypes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.47-1.06) and a significantly protective effect of miR-149 CT/CC on <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> incidence (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.29-0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SNPs of rs2292832 and rs2043556 might be able to modify the susceptibility to male gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tea drinking is a protective factor, while smoke inhalation is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, and they might have the potential to modify the associations between miR-149 and miR-605 polymorphisms with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> was shown to be a risk factor for both gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
