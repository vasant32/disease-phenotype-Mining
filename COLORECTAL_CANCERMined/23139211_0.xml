<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 744 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and 36 CRC cell lines were sequenced for SMAD4, SMAD2, and SMAD3 and analyzed for allelic loss by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation spectra were compared between the genes, the pathogenicity of mutations was assessed, and relationships with clinicopathologic features were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SMAD4, SMAD2, and SMAD3 mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> was 8.6% (64 of 744), 3.4% (25 of 744), and 4.3% (32 of 744), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant overrepresentation of two genetic hits was detected for SMAD4 and SMAD3, consistent with these genes acting as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SMAD4 mutations were associated with mucinous histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation spectra of SMAD2 and SMAD3 were highly similar to that of SMAD4, both in mutation type and location within the encoded proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In silico analyses suggested the majority of the mutations were pathogenic, with most missense changes predicted to reduce protein stability or hinder SMAD complex formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter altered interface residues or disrupted the phosphorylation-regulated Ser-Ser-X-Ser motifs within SMAD2 and SMAD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional analyses of selected mutations showed reductions in SMAD3 transcriptional activity and SMAD2-SMAD4 complex formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Joint biallelic hits in SMAD2 and SMAD3 were overrepresented and mutually exclusive to SMAD4 mutation, underlining the critical roles of these three proteins within the TGF-β signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
