<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>KRAS status is now a mandatory prerequisite in order to treat metastatic colorectal patients with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations are unambiguously linked to a lack of response to these targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the major clinical impact of KRAS status, an observational study has been designed in France, focusing on the ability to perform KRAS testing between october 2008 and october 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was retro-prospective, national, multicentric, descriptive and non interventional, concerning public and private institutions and KRAS non mutated patients treated with panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate delays between the genotyping KRAS request and the result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives were: type of genotyping requests (systematic/prospective or specific/retrospective), prevalence of the different genotyping techniques, delays between the genotyping KRAS request and therapy with panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 329 patients from 66 centres have been included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>About half of them belonged to private institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were obtained with a mean delay of 33.4 Â± 39.8 days (CI 95%: [28.8; 37.9] days; median: 24 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of KRAS genotyping tests were performed on specific requests (65.3%), from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> (80.4%) and from a surgical specimen (73.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The more frequently used techniques for KRAS genotyping were: real time PCR (36.2%), sequencing (24.8%) and pyrosequencing (13.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study emphasizes the functionality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> molecular genetic platforms dedicated to KRAS genotyping, which allow the use of molecular predictive biomarkers by different medical institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study also underlines the broad spectrum of genotyping techniques (no consensus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The delays of response are still longer than expected but might be improved by optimizing the procedures </plain></SENT>
