<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, statewide, population-based data from South Carolina Central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry are used to investigate the relationship between race and age on advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population was comprised of 3,865 advanced pathologically documented colon and <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cases diagnosed between 01 January 1996 and 31 December 2006: 2,673 (69 %) EA and 1,192 (31 %) AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier methods were used to generate median survival time and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) by race, age, and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with survival were evaluated by fitting Cox proportional hazards regression models to generate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a significant interaction between race and age on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among younger patients (&lt;50 years), AA race was associated with a 1.34 times (95 % CI 1.06-1.71) higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among older patients, we observed a modest increase in risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among AA men compared with EA [HR 1.16 (95 % CI 1.01-1.32)] but no difference by race between women [HR 0.94 (95 % CI 0.82-1.08)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed that the disparity in survival has worsened over the past 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Future studies that integrate clinical, molecular, and treatment-related data are needed for advancing understanding of the racial disparity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival, especially for those &lt;50 years old </plain></SENT>
