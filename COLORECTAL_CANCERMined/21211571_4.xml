<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have assessed the association of six polymorphisms and relative haplotypes in the MTHFR gene (rs1801133 and rs1801131) and in the MTRR gene (rs1801394, rs1532268, rs162036, and rs10380) with the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 666 patients and 1377 controls from the Czech Republic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the 677 C&gt;T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene significantly decreased the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in homozygous carriers of the variant allele (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, we noted a significantly different distribution of genotypes between cases and controls for the 66A&gt;G polymorphism in the MTRR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, homozygous carriers of the G-containing allele of this polymorphism were at an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04-1.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis of the two MTHFR polymorphisms showed a moderate difference in the distribution of the TA haplotype between cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison to the most common haplotype (CA), the TA haplotype was associated with a decreased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference in the distribution between cases and controls was observed for the haplotypes based on the four polymorphisms in the MTRR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that the 677TT genotype and the TA haplotype in the MTHFR gene may also have a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in the Czech population, indicating the importance of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For MTRR, additional studies on larger populations are needed to clarify the possible role of variation in this gene in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
