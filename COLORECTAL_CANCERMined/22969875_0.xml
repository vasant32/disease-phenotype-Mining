<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are relatively well characterized and are correlated to the accumulation of genetic mutations and certain patterns of gene expression/over-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are a number of possible molecular factors involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression in the aforementioned pathways, which are as yet not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these factors appears to be the gene FJ 194940.1, previously termed P65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FJ 194940.1 consists of 6 exons and probably undergoes alternative splicing in malignant tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, tissue samples from 102 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> were investigated to confirm alternative splicing and to correlate results obtained with clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 splice variants, which arise from various combinations of 4 exons (II, III, IV and V) and exon-exon junctions between exons 1 and 2 (I/II); 2 and 3 (II/III); 3 and 4 (III/IV), as well as 4 and 5 (IV/V), were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For statistical analysis the full length transcript was divided into parts A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Part A consisted of exons II and III, as well as I/II and II/III exon-exon junctions, whereas part B comprised exons IV and V, as well as III/IV and IV/V exon-exon junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of part B of the FJ 194940.1 gene transcript is correlated with well-differentiated (G1) and moderately differentiated cases (G2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lymphocytic tumor</z:e> infiltration, a good prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, was significantly correlated to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elements in part A of the FJ 194940.1 gene transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elements in part A of the transcript survived for a shorter duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the FJ 194940.1 gene revealed that the gene had undergone alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the role of its transcripts and potential proteins should be examined in detail </plain></SENT>
