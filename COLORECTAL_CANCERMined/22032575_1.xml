<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the perceived superiority of specialist reporting, service demands dictate that general pathologists report <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens in many centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine differences in the completeness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> reporting between specialist gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal pathologists in both the narrative and synoptic formats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Pathology reports from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> resections performed between 1997 and 2008 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A standardized, synoptic report was formally introduced in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reports were assessed for completeness according to 10 mandatory elements from the College of American Pathologists checklist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, synoptic reports (n  =  315) were more complete than narrative reports (n  =  183) for TNM stage, distance to the circumferential radial margin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade, lymphovascular invasion, extramural venous invasion, perineural invasion, and regional deposits (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with those by nonspecialist pathologists, narrative reports by gastrointestinal pathologists were more complete for lymphovascular invasion (59.3% versus 35.9%, P  =  .02) and extramural venous invasion (70.4% versus 35.9%, P  =  .001), but there was no difference in completeness once a synoptic report was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal pathologists tended to report the presence of extramural venous invasion more frequently in both the narrative (18.5% versus 5.1%, P  =  .01) and synoptic formats (25.5% versus 14.6%, P  =  .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Completeness of reporting, irrespective of subspecialist interest, was dramatically increased by the use of a synoptic report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvements in completeness were most pronounced among nongastrointestinal pathologists, enabling them to attain a level of report completeness comparable to that of gastrointestinal pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine whether there are actual discrepancies in the detection of prognostic features between specialist gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal pathologists </plain></SENT>
