<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty-seven general surgeons received a questionnaire with 21 questions covering organizational characteristics of OMGs and the individual perceived benefits of OMGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The responses were analyzed by hospital setting (teaching vs. community hospital) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reply rate was 62.8 %, and 82 respondent surgeons (49.1 %) were involved in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At community hospitals, there was a more frequent participation of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and pathologists; a less selection of discussed cases was performed; and almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decisions were inserted into official patient charts (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Community hospital surgeons perceived more of a benefit than academic surgeons: OMGs ensure that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment options are considered and improve timeliness of care, patient outcomes, patient satisfaction and communication with patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surveyed surgeons reported that OMGs offer a modest degree of protection from malpractice but improve communications between colleagues and are an opportunity for personal professional development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Professionals regularly participating in well-conducted and well-organized OMGs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> felt that the multidisciplinary strategy may be advantageous to both patients and caregivers </plain></SENT>
