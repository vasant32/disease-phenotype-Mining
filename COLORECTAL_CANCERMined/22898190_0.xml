<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: For several decades urinary arylsulfatase (ARS) activity has been reported to be elevated in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that urinary ARS activity may serve as a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and therapy surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the clinical application of detection of urinary ARS activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a modified precipitation method to separate ARS from urine samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method was easy to use and applicable for a high throughput assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested and analyzed the morning urinary ARS activity in 300 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, 97 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign tumors</z:e> and 119 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346629" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant colorectal tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male and female controls, morning urinary ARS activity was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346629" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant colorectal tumor</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, morning urinary ARS activity had a relatively high efficacy in distinguishing patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346629" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant colorectal tumors</z:e> from those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0347272" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve in the receiver operator characteristics curve analysis was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.95) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79-0.94) in male and female colorectal patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest the potential application of morning urinary ARS activity to conventional clinical use </plain></SENT>
