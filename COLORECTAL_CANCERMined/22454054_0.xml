<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis in these genes has resulted in the identification of a large number of sequence variants, of which mutations causing frame shifts and nonsense codons are considered undoubtedly to be pathogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many variants, however, cannot be classified as either disease-causing mutations or neutral variants and are therefore called unclassified variants (UVs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subset of these variants may have an effect on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Appropriate <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> analysis will enable the characterization of the exact molecular nature of this effect and hence, is essential to determine the clinical relevance of the genomic variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This chapter describes the design and implementation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> analysis as an indispensible tool in today's clinical diagnostic setting </plain></SENT>
