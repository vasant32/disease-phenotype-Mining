<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33505">Adenosyl</z:chebi> methionine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi>) supplementation is effective in the treatment of a variety of liver injuries, but it has never been evaluated in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced liver damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 105 patients affected by resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-five were treated with FOLFOX IV adjuvant regimen without administering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi>, 60 were treated with the same regimen plus supplementation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Liver enzyme levels were assessed before starting the treatment and every therapy cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liver toxicity, chemotherapy course delays, discontinuations and dose reductions due to liver toxicity were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">Aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (AST) (p &lt; 0.001), alanine transaminase (ALT) (p = 0.003), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (p = 0.04) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (Î³-GT) (p = 0.002) median level at the end of adjuvant therapy were significantly lower in patients treated with Adome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients supplemented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi> experimented a lower grade of liver toxicity (p = 0.002) and had a reduced need of course delay (p &lt; 0.0001) and dose reduction (p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study demonstrate a protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi> supplementation in patients affected by resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated with FOLFOX IV adjuvant regimen </plain></SENT>
