<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with longstanding extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, have an increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of this risk, colonoscopic surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is recommended by most authorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there has been no randomised controlled trial to demonstrate surveillance effectiveness, there are several retrospective comparative studies, which suggest that surveillance reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade there have been a number of developments in our understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have discovered that the severity of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is an important risk factor, in addition to other known risk factors such as the extent and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> and a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic techniques have also improved and evidence now demonstrates that pancolonic chromoendoscopy yields significantly more intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> than random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection of well-circumscribed lesions is now also recognised as being an appropriate strategy, potentially reducing the number of patients requiring colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that such developments will further improve the effectiveness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> surveillance </plain></SENT>
