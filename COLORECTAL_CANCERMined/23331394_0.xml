<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before the introduction of imaging technologies, the diagnosis of colorectal pathology was based on conventional methods of inspecting intestines with a <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema, with either a single or double contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following the development of endoscopic methods and the wide use of colonoscopy, colonoscopy became the method of choice for diagnosing colorectal diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The improvement of Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gave us new possibilities for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, trans-rectal US (TRUS) or endo-anal US (EAUS) have a significant role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For staging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, the Multi Slice Computed Tomography (MSCT) is not the method of choice, but Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is preferred when it comes to monitoring the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of the MRI in the T staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> is crucial in preoperative assessment of: thickness - the width of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, the extramural invasion, the circumference of resection margin (CRM), and the assessment of the inclusion of mesorectal fascia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For successful execution of surgical techniques, good diagnostic imaging of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is necessary in order to have a low level of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to medical studies, the sensitivity of FDG-PET in diagnosing metastatic nodals is low, but for now it is not recommended in routine diagnosis of metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
