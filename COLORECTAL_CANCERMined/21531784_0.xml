<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies investigating the prognostic role of mucinous histology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> produced conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis was carried out in order to explore whether mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (MC) is associated with a comparatively worse prognosis than that of nonmucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (NMC) for patients undergoing curative resection for stage II and III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study involved 1025 unselected patients who underwent curative surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and follow-up procedures at six different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCs accounted for 17.4% (n=178) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with MC had 5- and 8-year overall survival rates of 78.6% and 68.8%, respectively, compared with 72.3% and 63.8%, respectively, for patients with nonmucinous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that the clinically significant prognostic factors were stage of disease and adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant interaction between mucinous histology and adjuvant chemotherapy was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with stage II and III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> who underwent curative surgery, mucinous histology has no significant correlation with prognosis compared with NMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis suggests a comparable benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for MC compared with NMC </plain></SENT>
