<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reintroduction of the WT APC gene into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells generally reduces tumorigenicity or induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the possibility of using drugs to induce premature termination codon (PTC) readthrough (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycosides</z:chebi>, negamycin), as a means of reactivating endogenous APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By quantifying the readthrough of 11 nonsense mutations in APC, we were able to identify those giving the highest levels of readthrough after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these mutations, we demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycoside</z:chebi> or negamycin treatment led to a recovery of the biological activity of APC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, and showed that the level of APC activity was proportional to the level of induced readthrough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings show that treatment with readthrough inducers should be considered as a potential strategy for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> caused by nonsense mutations APC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also provide a rational basis for identifying mutations responsive to readthrough inducers </plain></SENT>
