<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonpolypoid colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> may potentially explain some of these post-colonoscopy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we aimed to examine the prevalence and malignant potential of nonpolypoid colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in a large population, with special attention to gender and location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients undergoing elective colonoscopy at a single academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endoscopists were familiarized on the detection and treatment of nonpolypoid lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Advanced histology was defined by the presence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 2310 patients (53.9% women, mean age 58.4 years) with 2143 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalences of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and nonpolypoid colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were lower in women than in men (20.9% vs. 33.7%, p &lt; 0.001 and 3.0% vs. 5.5%, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, nonpolypoid colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were significantly more likely to contain advanced histology than polypoid ones (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.24-6.74, p = 0.01), while this was not the case in men (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.40-2.06, p = 0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with advanced histology were more likely to be nonpolypoid than distal ones (OR 4.68, 95% CI 1.54-14.2, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nonpolypoid mechanisms may play an important role in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, in both women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although women have fewer colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> than men, they have nonpolypoid colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, which frequently contain advanced histology </plain></SENT>
