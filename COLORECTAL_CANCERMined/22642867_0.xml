<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hb levels and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements were evaluated among 1900 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> in 11 European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a target Hb level of ≥10-≤12 g/dL after 9 weeks' <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The full analysis set (FAS) comprised 1887 patients (mean ± SD age 62.4 ± 11.4 years) divided into categories by baseline Hb &lt; 9 g/dL (n = 281); 9-&lt;10 g/dL (n = 770); 10-&lt;11 g/dL (n = 695); ≥11 g/dL (n = 114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients who remained on the study at week 9 achieving the target Hb level was 37% (n = 60), 48% (n = 217), 54% (n = 210) and 38% (n = 23) in the subgroups with a baseline Hb level of &lt;9 g/dL, 9-&lt;10 g/dL, 10-&lt;11 g/dL and ≥11 g/dL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the &lt;9 g/dL, 9-&lt;10 g/dL, 10-&lt;11 g/dL and ≥11 g/dL subgroups of the FAS, the number of patients maintaining Hb levels ≥10 g/dL after their first achievement of an Hb value of 10 g/dL was 95 (34%), 372 (48%), 476 (68%) and 87 (76%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier percentages of patients who required an RBC transfusion from week 5 until end of treatment period were: 29%, 20%, 12% and 17% in the &lt;9 g/dL, 9-&lt;10 g/dL, 10-&lt;11 g/dL and ≥11 g/dL subgroups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier percentages of patients reaching an Hb level of &gt;13 g/dL were 10%, 9%, 21% and 29%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Potential bias could not be excluded due to the study's observational nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> initiation and target Hb ranges adhered to current guidelines in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study demonstrates faster achievement of the target range and reduced transfusion requirements are associated with initiation of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> at Hb levels of 9-&lt;10 g/dL and 10-&lt;11 g/dL rather than &lt;9 g/dL </plain></SENT>
