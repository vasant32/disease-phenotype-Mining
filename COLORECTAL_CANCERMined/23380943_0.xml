<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies of red and processed meat intake and risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> as part of the Continuous Update Project of the World <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research Fund </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: PubMed and several other databases were searched for relevant studies from their inception up to 31 December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary relative risks (RRs) were estimated using a random effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen case-control studies and seven prospective studies were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The summary RR per 100 g/day of red meat was 1.27 (95 % CI 1.16-1.40, I (2) = 5 %, n = 16) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies combined, 1.20 (95 % CI 1.06-1.36, I (2) = 0 %, n = 6) for prospective studies, and 1.34 (95 % CI 1.12-1.59, I (2) = 31 %, n = 10) for case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The summary RR per 50 g/day of processed meat intake was 1.29 (95 % CI 1.10-1.53, I (2) = 27 %, n = 10) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies combined, 1.45 (95 % CI 1.10-1.90, I (2) = 0 %, n = 2) for prospective studies, and 1.23 (95 % CI 0.99-1.52, I (2) = 37 %, n = 8) for case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was evidence of a nonlinear association between red meat (p nonlinearity &lt; 0.001) and processed meat (p nonlinearity = 0.01) intake and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate an elevated risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with intake of red and processed meat, but further prospective studies are warranted </plain></SENT>
