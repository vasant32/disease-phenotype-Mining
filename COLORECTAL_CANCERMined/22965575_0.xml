<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This phase II trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 in patients with curatively resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results of an interim analysis of safety and short-term outcomes are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who underwent curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> received S-1 monotherapy (on days 1-28, followed by 14 days' rest, 8 cycles) as adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 62 patients enrolled between October 2008 and August 2010, a total of 60 patients were eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in three patients (5.0 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonhematologic toxicities of grade 3 or higher were <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> in 6.7 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 4 enteritis occurred in one patient, but resolved promptly after withdrawal of S-1 therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The completion rate of the eight scheduled cycles of chemotherapy was 58.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common reasons for withdrawal of treatment was the detection of early relapse in 16 patients (64 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the 16 patients who had recurrence during adjuvant treatment were excluded from analysis, 79.5 % of the remaining 44 patients completed the scheduled treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early recurrence within 1 year after curative liver resection occurred in 21 patients (35 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common site was the remnant liver in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered S-1 after curative liver resection has an acceptable toxicity profile and a high rate of completion of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>S-1 can be safely used and might be a viable treatment option in an adjuvant setting </plain></SENT>
