<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 317 patients with pT2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>pT2a represents the infiltration of the inner circumferential layer of the MP, and pT2b represents the infiltration of the outer longitudinal layer of the MP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic factors and overall survival rates were compared in patients with pT2a and pT2b stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the significantly important prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, respectively, to identify the significantly important clinicopathologic factors correlated with LNM and postoperative hematogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in pT2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the depth of MP invasion, 107 patients were classified as pT2a and 210 patients were classified as pT2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them, there were 55 patients with LNM, 34 patients with postoperative hematogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference in most of clinicopathologic features between patients in the pT2a and pT2b stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified pN stage (P &lt; .001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (P = .036) were independent factors affecting the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no apparent difference was observed between pT2a versus pT2b <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses uniformly identified lymphovascular invasion (P = .035) and the depth of MP invasion (P = .005) as significantly correlated with LNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis found <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (P = .021) and the presence or absence of LNM (P &lt; .001) were important factors affecting postoperative hematogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In pT2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with R0 surgery, there is a high risk of LNM in deep MP invasion versus superficial MP invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The pT2 subclassification system had no significant advantage in identifying a different prognosis, except for predicting the LNM before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal cancer</z:e> and the presence of LNM were high-risk factors resulting in hematogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> postoperatively </plain></SENT>
