<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the median survival for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastasis</z:e> (BM) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is short </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we retrospectively investigated the BM from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and examined the prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 29 CRC patients who developed BM; the lesions were diagnosed synchronously in 1 patient and metachronously in 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After BM, the median survival time was 7.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the groups of patients who underwent surgical resection and radiation therapy, the median survival times were 8.3 and 7.4 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The curability of the therapy for BM, number of BM, number of metastatic organs including the brain, and the CEA level at the time of treatment of the BM were significantly associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (P = 0.0044, 0.0229, 0.0019, and 0.0205, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with BM from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was associated with the curability of the therapy for BM, number of metastatic organs, and the serum CEA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The modality of treatment had no significant impact on the outcome </plain></SENT>
