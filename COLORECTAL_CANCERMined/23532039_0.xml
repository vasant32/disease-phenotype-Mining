<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Stephen Paget's proposed an original "seed and soil" theory, with organ-preference patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor metastasis</z:e> resulting in interaction between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e> cells and their specific microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is many experimental and clinical data showing that this theory is validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, it has been suggested that early changes in the microenvironment at the distant sites, could be induced by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, reported as "pre-metastatic niche" formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells could produce growth factors, cytokines which could facilitate the recruitment and the mobilization of the bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells, and thus necessary for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> neovascularization and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical value of the concept of the premetastatic niche is not yet elucidated, these data could encourage surgeons to perform the colorectal surgery first and then the liver surgery, in patients with synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reciprocal interactions between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and microenvironment at the distant sites are therefore determinant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the microenvironment is an important therapeutic target and surgeons and oncologist could discuss the choice of different surgical strategy for patient with synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> regarding the interaction with the microenvironment affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
