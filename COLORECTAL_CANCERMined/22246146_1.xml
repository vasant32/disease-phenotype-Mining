<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥ 6 mm detected at CT colonography (CTC) performed without cathartic preparation, with low-dose <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> faecal tagging regimen and to evaluate patient experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1920 average-risk patients underwent CTC without cathartic preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Faecal tagging was performed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53691">diatrizoate</z:chebi> meglumine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53692">diatrizoate sodium</z:chebi> at a total dose of 60 ml (22.2 g of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>).The standard interpretation method was primary 3D with 2D problem solving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated per-patient and per-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> in relation to size and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> colonic segments were evaluated for image quality (faecal tagging, amount of liquid and solid residual faeces and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> distension) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients completed a questionnaire before and after CTC to assess preparation and examination experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Per-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> for detected lesions of ≥ 6 mm, 6-9 mm, ≥ 10 mm and ≥ 30 mm were 94.3%, 93.1%, 94.7% and 98%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Per-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, according to lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, was 94.6%, 97.3% and 85.1% for sessile, pedunculated and flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Per-patient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> was 92.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preparation without frank cathartics was reported to cause minimal discomfort by 78.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTC without cathartic preparation and low-dose <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> faecal tagging may yield high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi> for lesions ≥ 6 mm and is well accepted by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS: • Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) without cathartic preparation is well accepted by patients • Cathartic-free faecal tagging CTC yields high positive predictive values • CTC without cathartic preparation could improve uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
