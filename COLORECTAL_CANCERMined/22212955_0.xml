<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to assess the effect of promoter variations of HMOX1 and UGT1A1 genes and of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This exploratory case-control study was based on 777 CRC patients and 986 controls from the Czech Republic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The (GT)(n) and (TA)(n) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> variations in HMOX1 and UGT1A1 gene promoters, respectively, were determined by fragment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the A(-413)T variant in HMOX1 promoter was also analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were compared in a subset of 174 cases and 247 controls, for whom biochemical data were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, a significant association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk and UGT1A1*28 allele carrier status was detected [odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) = 0.80 (0.60-0.97), p = 0.022] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk and individual HMOX1 gene variants was observed, although a diplotype analysis revealed an increased risk for a specific HMOX1 genotype combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were more pronounced in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Substantially lower serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels were detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients compared to the controls (p &lt; 0.001); each 1 Î¼mol/L decrease in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was associated with a 7% increase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, UGT1A1*28 allele carrier status might be a protective factor against the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the male population, whereas low serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels are associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in both genders </plain></SENT>
