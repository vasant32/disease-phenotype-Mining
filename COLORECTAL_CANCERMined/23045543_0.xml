<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study objective was to measure patient navigation effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific quality of life (QOL) among patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of patient navigation was conducted in Rochester, NY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomly assigned to receive a patient navigation intervention or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QOL was measured at baseline and four subsequent time points, using the validated Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy (FACT-B, FACT-C) instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 319 randomized patients (165 patient navigation, 154 control), median age was 57 years and 32.5% were from minority race/ethnicity groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient navigation and control groups were comparable on baseline factors, except home ownership versus renting (more home ownership among controls, P = 0.05) and race (more whites among controls, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total and subscale FACT scores did not differ between groups when analyzed as a change from baseline to 3 months, or at various time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The emotional well-being subscale change from baseline approached significance (better change among patient navigation group, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time trends of QOL measures did not differ significantly between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for baseline patient factors did not reveal a benefit of patient navigation on QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial of patient navigation, there was no statistically significant effect on disease-specific QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: These results suggest that patient navigation may not affect QOL during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, that social/medical support are adequate in this study's setting, or that the trial failed to target patients likely to experience QOL benefit from patient navigation </plain></SENT>
