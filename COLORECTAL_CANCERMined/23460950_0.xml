<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New markers, identifying high-risk Dukes' B patients, are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine the utility of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) as such a marker and promoter methylation as a mechanism of RKIP down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a tissue microarray of 220 patients with Dukes' B <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> to examine the effect of RKIP expression on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pyrosequencing was used to assess RKIP promoter methylation status.RKIP expression correlated inversely with disease-specific survival in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, RKIP was found to be an independent prognostic indicator, along with peritoneal invasion and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RKIP promoter hypermethylation was seen in only one of 29 tumours analysed by pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Raf kinase inhibitor protein, peritoneal invasion and LVI provide independent prognostic information in this cohort of Dukes' B <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients.This demonstrates the potential utility of RKIP in identifying 'high-risk' Dukes' B patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is this high-risk group which is most likely to benefit from close postoperative monitoring and may derive the most benefit from adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
