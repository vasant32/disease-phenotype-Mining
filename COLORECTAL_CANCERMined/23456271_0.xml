<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The associations between bowel movement frequency, <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> use, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No published studies have accounted for potential latency between these factors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively examined these associations among 88,173 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 1982-2010) and 23,722 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, 2000-2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs, 95 % CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted time lagged analyses to evaluate the potential latency in the NHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We documented 2,012 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HRs (95 % CIs) for infrequent bowel movement relative to daily were 0.86 (95 % CI 0.71-1.04) in women and 0.81 (95 % CI 0.48-1.37) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HRs for weekly to daily relative to never <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> use were 0.98 (95 % CI 0.81-1.20) in women and 1.41 (95 % CI 0.96-2.06) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, the HRs for every 3 days or less bowel movement relative to daily were 0.87 (95 % CI 0.59-1.27) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> that developed within 10 years of assessment, 1.03 (95 % CI 0.85-1.26) for 11-18 years after assessment, and 0.73 (95 % CI 0.54-1.01) for 19-28 years after assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The corresponding HRs for weekly to daily relative to never <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> use were 0.93 (95 % CI 0.63-1.37), 1.03 (95 % CI 0.74-1.44), and 0.98 (95 % CI 0.71-1.35), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bowel movement frequency and <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> use appear not to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in this study </plain></SENT>
