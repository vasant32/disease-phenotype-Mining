<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) remains one of the largest hurdles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapeutics to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most advanced treatment option for mCRC patients are anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to and inhibit the activity of EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the use of anti-EGFR mABs has had great impact in the treatment of mCRC, it has now been widely accepted that mCRC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a mutation in the small GTPase KRAS do not respond to these therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations allow for EGFR independent activation of various oncogenic signaling cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In attempts to inhibit KRAS mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, BRAF, MEK and farsenyltransferase inhibitors have been used, however, their clinical efficacy is still accruing in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggests that various other inhibitors, including inhibitors of Src family kinases (SFK) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), may have potential preclinical and clinical success in KRAS mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it is becoming increasingly clear that different KRAS missense mutations may have varied biological responses to cetuximab, suggesting that cetuximab may still be a potential therapeutic option in some KRAS mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, we highlight the importance for both improved multimodality approaches for treating KRAS mutant mCRC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and stratification of KRAS mutations in response to different treatment regimes in order to optimize the best possible care for mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
