<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated leptin and PPARG expression in 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> over 1 cm in size by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, clinicopathologic features including BMI were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PPARG and leptin expression showed a strong positive correlation (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average BMI of the leptin-positive group was higher than that of the leptin-negative group (25.4 ± 3.4 kg/m(2)vs 22.6 ± 2.4 kg/m(2), P = 0.018), and leptin expression was significantly correlated with high BMI (P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leptin expression was more frequently observed in intermediate/high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> than in low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, PPARG expression was not correlated with BMI and grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BMI has influenced on the leptin expression of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanism underlies the strong correlation between leptin and PPARG expression needs further study </plain></SENT>
