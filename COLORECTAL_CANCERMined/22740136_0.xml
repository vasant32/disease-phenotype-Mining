<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a genome-wide association study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (GC) reported the significant association of seven genetic variants (rs4072037 and rs4460629 on 1q22; rs753724, rs11187842, rs3765524, rs2274223, and rs3781264 on 10q23) with GC in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed in a subsequent independent study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unknown whether these loci are associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was to test whether the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with GC were also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The seven SNPs were genotyped using MassARRAY system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allelic, genotypic, and haplotypic associations of the SNPs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were investigated using Ï‡(2) tests and logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SNPs rs3765524 and rs2274223, located on 10q23, were found to have significant protective effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, with equal odds ratios per allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two SNPs located on 1q22 (rs4072037 and rs4460629) showed a weak association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant association was identified with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for the remaining three SNPs located on 10q23 (rs753724, rs11187842, and rs3781264) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rs3765524 and rs2274223 on 10q23 are associated with a protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
