<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Information on the efficiency of "tailored interventions" to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in primary care settings is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The paper reports the results of a cost effectiveness analysis that compared a survey-only control group to a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) web-based intervention (screen for life) and to a tailored interactive computer-based intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of people 50 and over, was conducted to test the interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sample was 1224 participants 50-70 years of age, recruited from Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, a large multi-specialty clinic in Houston, Texas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening status was obtained by medical chart review after a 12-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An "intention to treat" analysis and micro costing from the patient and provider perspectives were used to estimate the costs and effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of statistical uncertainty was conducted using nonparametric bootstrapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated cost of implementing the web-based intervention was $40 per person and the cost of the tailored intervention was $45 per person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The additional cost per person screened for the web-based intervention compared to no intervention was $2602 and the tailored intervention was no more effective than the web-based strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The tailored intervention was less cost-effective than the web-based intervention for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening promotion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The web-based intervention was less cost-effective than previous studies of in-reach <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening promotion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Researchers need to continue developing and evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
