<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the relationship between PTGS2 (COX2) polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in a hospital based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recruited 292 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 274 controls from new patients admitted to Bellvitge Hospital, Barcelona, Spain, from 1996 to 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects responded to a questionnaire on risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotypes of the eight more frequent polymorphisms of PTGS2 were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two polymorphisms are located in the promoter sequence, one in the untranslated region of exon 1, one in exon 3, one in intron 5, two in the untranslated region of exon 10, and one downstream of the last polyadenylation (poly-A) signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations were analysed with logistic regression models assuming a dominant effect for rare variants to increase statistical power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An association was detected between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and a polymorphism in the untranslated region of exon 10 of PTGS2, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.17-5.32, P=0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A nearby polymorphism downstream of the last poly-A signal also showed a nonsignificant increase in risk (OR 2.17, 95% CI 0.99-4.78, P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of haplotypes confirmed that individuals with these variants were at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR compared to the most frequent haplotype: 2.17, 95% CI 0.97-4.84, P=0.06) Interactions between PTGS2 genotype and use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were also explored </plain></SENT>
