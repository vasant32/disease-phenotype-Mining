<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic (Lap) surgery has been introduced as an alternative approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and short- to long-term outcomes after prophylactic FAP surgery in adolescent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: A retrospective review of a database of adolescent patients with FAP identified through the Hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Tumor</z:e> Registry in a single Institution between 2005 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent Lap total colectomy (TC) with ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA) or proctocolectomy (PC) with ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcomes were: Hospital stay, postoperative complications, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_723'>desmoid tumor</z:mpath> rates, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence, long-term complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen consecutive patients with median age 16 (range 13-19) and median BMI 22 (17-29) underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>[correction made here after initial online publication] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of them 14 patients had LAP TC with IRA and 2 had PC with IPAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Operative time (median, range) was TC/IRA 270 (210-330) minutes; PC/IPAA 370 (360-380) minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Length of extraction site was cm (median, range) 6(5-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lymph Node harvest (median, range) 81 (32-139) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperative stay days (median, range) were 6 (4-24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five patients (31.2%) showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on the pathological report and 3 of them showed severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time (FU) was 39 months, range (10-82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The anastomotic leak rate for 30 days was 2 (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Pouch failure was 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Post-surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100245'>desmoid tumors</z:hpo> rate was 1 (6.2%) and there was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic stricture, SBO and mortality were zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lap approach is feasible and shows acceptable postoperative outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Lap surgery can be an appealing alternative for prophylactic surgery in adolescent FAP patients </plain></SENT>
