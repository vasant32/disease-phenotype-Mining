<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were treated in the Center of Colorectal Surgery of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of TCM were collected prospectively and followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A tissue microarray was made and expressions of JAG1 and DLL1 were detected by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 146 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differences in JAG1 expression were significant among different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation types and the differences in DLL1 expression were significant among different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> locations(<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the expression of the two genes and microsatellite instability(MSI)(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-four (91.8%) cases were followed up and the mean follow-up time was (42.3Â±13.3) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>-free survival was noticed in 86 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was 93% at 1 year, 74% in 3 years, and 67% in 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that long-term survival rate was related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TMN</z:e> stage, pathology types, MSI status and expression of JAG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of patients with high expression of JAG1 was better than those with low and negative expression(P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The expressions of JAG1 and DLL1 are related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression of JAG1 gene is associated with long-term survival </plain></SENT>
