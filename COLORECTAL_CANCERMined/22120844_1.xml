<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously established in a large retrospective study that testing for microsatellite instability (MSI) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) from patients aged &lt;60 years was an effective first screen to identify individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> (LS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From these findings, MSI and/or immunohistochemical (IHC) screening was recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients aged &lt;60 years in Western Australia, regardless of family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study we evaluated the utility of routine MSI/IHC screening by diagnostic pathology laboratories for the detection of previously undiagnosed individuals and families with LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From January 2009 to December 2010, 270 tumours were tested for MSI and for expression of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 using IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases showing MSI and/or loss of expression were also tested for the BRAF V600E hotspot mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy cases were found to have MSI, of which 25 were excluded from further investigation as possible LS cases due to presence of the BRAF V600E mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 45 "red flag" cases were eligible for germline testing based on their MSI, IHC and BRAF status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From 31 cases tested to date, 15 germline mutations have been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen were from individuals not previously recognized as LS and two were untested members from known LS families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Extrapolation of the mutation incidence (15/31, 48%) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> red flag cases (n = 45) suggests that approximately 22 mutation carriers exist in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This value approximates the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases due to LS that could be expected to arise in the Western Australian population over a two-year period (n = 24), assuming that 1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> are due to LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although further improvements in workflow can be made, our preliminary findings following the implementation of state-wide routine MSI and IHC testing in Western Australia indicate that the majority of LS cases are being identified </plain></SENT>
