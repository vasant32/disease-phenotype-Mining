<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although surgical resection alone has been validated as a standard treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, a high rate of recurrence is still an issue to be overcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy using an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based regimen in patients who underwent hepatic and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based postoperative chemotherapy combined with curative resection of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> between January 2000 and February 2008 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, and prognostic factors were evaluated with the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was 62.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 44.1-81.3], and median relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) was 32.8 months (95% CI 5.8-59.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 95.0, 68.8 and 55.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relapse-free interval and modality of liver resection were independently associated with OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection resulted in increased OS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> with acceptable tolerability compared to surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it is not yet clear whether postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy improves outcome compared to patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> plus leucovorin </plain></SENT>
