<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: This paper reports on how people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compare experiences, what comparison meant to them and the context in which it took place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: People with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> need information to make sense of their disease and treatment, and comparing with others in similar situations provides such opportunities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While social comparison studies date back more than half a century, there is a lack of qualitative approaches to explore how people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> compare with others and the context in which they do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In-depth interviews were carried out in the period 2006-2007 with a convenience sample of 24 men and 14 women with a first diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Most participants could not avoid the almost constant exposure to other people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or hear of their stories, especially when they accessed health services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison was part of their interaction with the 'community' of people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, which included giving and receiving information and support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many valued this 'experiential' information, while some tried to avoid contact with others with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as they felt that it would depress them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study also showed that many of the participants had personal experience of caring for close relatives with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and this helped them to make sense of their own condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The challenge for health professionals is to help people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> to interpret the information and beliefs they already have from such previous experience or they obtain when comparing with others with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
