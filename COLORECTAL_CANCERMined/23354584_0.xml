<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genotype distribution of the cyclin D1 gene in 130 CRC cases in comparison with 160 healthy controls was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No direct significant association between cyclin D1 genotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was observed; however, the AG and AA genotypes were found to be associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to the GG genotype, with an almost 2-fold increase in OR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the cyclin D1 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Kashmiri population </plain></SENT>
