<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether the Wnt pathway, an intracellular signaling cascade that plays a critical role in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, is activated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced elevation of the inflammatory cytokine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-α) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animal studies were conducted on C57BL/6 mice, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was induced by utilizing a high-fat diet (60% kcal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-specific microarray was performed, and results were confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The array revealed that diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> increased the expression of TNF-α in the colon by 72% (P=.004) and that of interleukin-18 by 41% (P=.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of colonic TNF-α protein, determined by ex vivo culture assay, was nearly doubled in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> animals (P=.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), an important intermediary inhibitor of Wnt signaling and a potential target of TNF-α, was quantitated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inactivated (phosphorylated) form of GSK3β was elevated in the colonic mucosa of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice (P&lt;.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, β-catenin, the key effector of canonical Wnt signaling, was elevated in the colons of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice (P&lt;.05), as was the expression of a downstream target gene, c-myc (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> produces an elevation in colonic TNF-α and instigates a number of alterations of key components within the Wnt signaling pathway that are protransformational in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, these observations offer evidence for a biologically plausible avenue, the Wnt pathway, by which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
