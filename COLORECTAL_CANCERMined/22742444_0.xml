<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the number of colonoscopies per year will rise and this will increase the demands for transparency concerning the individual skills of endoscopists and the endoscopy centres themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quality indicators such as the percentage of colonoscopies in which the caecum was intubated, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate (ADR), endoscope withdrawal time and the level of colon preparation should be monitored and controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recent study in the Netherlands showed that the percentage of caecal intubation was close to or above the proposed standard of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ADR was within quality limits, but the withdrawal time was not estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The colon preparation level surprisingly had no influence on ADR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the national screening program starts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participating endoscopists and centres must be sufficiently equipped to monitor their quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This implies that audits should start in 2012 </plain></SENT>
