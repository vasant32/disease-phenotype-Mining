<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive either folinic acid/fluorouracil/irinotecan alone (n = 20) or folinic acid/fluorouracil/irinotecan in combination with recombinant human endostatin (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy and toxicity were evaluated, and changes in TCR repertoire diversity were assessed by detecting the spectratypes of TCR complementarity-determining region three before and after several cycles of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A scoring system was used to quantify changes in the TCR repertoire over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the TCR repertoire exhibited a higher degree of normalization among patients undergoing remission relative to patients experiencing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the current study showed a positive correlation between TCR repertoire normalization and remission of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, suggesting that dynamic monitoring of TCR repertoire diversity may have potential prognostic value in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
