<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular imaging of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients was performed by CLE after topical application of a fluorescent-labeled molecular probe against EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Representative images of CLE were chosen to calculate EGFR-specific fluorescence intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Targeted biopsy specimens were taken from each examined site during in vivo imaging for histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During in vivo molecular imaging in 37 patients, an EGFR-specific fluorescence signal was present in 18/19 CRC, and 12/18 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
