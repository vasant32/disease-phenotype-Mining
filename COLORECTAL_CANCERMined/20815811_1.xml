<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor and DNA repair genes are often aberrantly hypermethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to examine whether the methylation profile of p16INK4a and hMLH1 (human mutL homologue 1) promoters was associated with clinical features and patients' survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation of p16INK4a and hMLH1 promoters was found in 47.2 and 53.4% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For adjacent non-tumoral mucosa, p16INK4a was fully unmethylated in 30% of the cases, whereas hMLH1 was predominantly unmethylated (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation of p16INK4a correlated with gender and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size (P=0.005 and 0.035 respectively), whereas those of hMLH1 significantly correlated with overall survival (P log rank=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant methylation of p16INK4a and hMLH1 was associated with TNM (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, lymph node and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>) stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size (P=0.024 and 0.021 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show that loss of hMLH1 expression through aberrant methylation could be used as a marker of poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
