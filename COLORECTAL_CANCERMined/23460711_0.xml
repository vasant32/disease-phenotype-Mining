<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of geriatric factors may help evaluate a patient's health status to better adapt treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS Elderly patients with previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (FU) -based chemotherapy either alone or in combination with irinotecan (IRI) in the Fédération Francophone de Cancérologie Digestive (FFCD) 2001-02 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sites participating in the geriatric substudy completed geriatric screening tools to perform prognostic factor analyses for treatment safety during the first 4 months after treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results The geriatric score was calculated in 123 patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 80 years (range, 75 to 91 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Charlson comorbidity index was ≤ 1 in 75%, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was ≤ 27/30 in 31%, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) showed impairment in 34% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one patients (58%) had grade 3 to 4 toxicity, 41 (33%) had a dose-intensity reduction of more than 33%, and 54 (44%) had at least one unexpected hospitalization during the first 4 months after starting treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, significant predictive factors for grade 3-4 toxicity were IRI arm (odds ratio [OR], 5.03), MMSE ≤ 27/30 (OR, 3.84), and impaired IADL (OR, 4.67); for dose-intensity reduction of &gt; 33%, the significant predictive factors were alkaline phosphates &gt; 2 × upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (OR, 4.16) and IRI arm (OR, 6.85); and for unexpected hospitalization, significant predictive factors were MMSE ≤ 27/30 (OR, 4.56) and Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale ≤ 2 (OR, 5.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION Geriatric factors (MMSE and IADL) are predictive of severe toxicity or unexpected hospitalization (MMSE) in a randomized prospective phase III study in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cognitive function and autonomy impairment should be taken into account when choosing a regimen for chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
