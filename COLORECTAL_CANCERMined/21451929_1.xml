<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to identify risk factors for early postoperative morbidity and mortality following curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery in our set-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data on patients with pathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent curative surgery at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, between January 1999 and December 2008 were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed early postoperative morbidity or mortality were compared with those who followed a healthy course after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 250 consecutive patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were found in 34.8 percent of the patients, out of which four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum albumin level less than 3.5 g/dl (odds ratio [OR] 3.75, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 1.37-10.23) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> involving the left colon (OR 2.60, 95 percent CI 1.02-6.64) were identified as independent risk factors for early postoperative complications on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A low serum albumin level and the presence of a left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic tumour</z:e> were significant risk factors for early postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Information on these complications and the risk factors for early postoperative outcome is an important consideration for patients and surgeons </plain></SENT>
