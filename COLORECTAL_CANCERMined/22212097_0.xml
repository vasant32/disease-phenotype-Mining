<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have shown that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may be involved in the vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we hypothesize that zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) promotes VM formation in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) by inducing EMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified VM in 39 (19.2%) out of 203 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of VM was associated with aggressive biological behavior and was an unfavorable prognostic indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemical analysis, we found that the VM-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples showed increased ZEB1 expression compared with the VM-negative samples and the ZEB1 expression occurred concomitantly with features of EMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, knockdown of ZEB1 in poorly differentiated HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells destroyed the vessel-like structures in the 3-D culture, a property associated with VM formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of ZEB1 resulted in restoration of epithelial phenotypes and significantly inhibited the ability to migrate and invade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, ZEB1 underexpression decreased the expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and Flk-1, which are characteristics of endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that ZEB1 can promote VM formation by inducing EMT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and might represent an important target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
