<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to identify the clinicopathological features and oncologic outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in post-renal transplants in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> out of 2,630 recipients who underwent renal transplantation between 1994 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients (transplant group) were compared with general <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (n=170, control group) matched, based on the closest date of surgery to the transplant group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 29.7 months of the median follow- up period, the recurrent and survival rates from recurrence were worse in the transplant group than in the control group (35.2% versus 15.2%; p=0.048 and p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-year patient survival rate of the transplant group was significantly worse than the control group in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> (stages III-IV; 45.7% versus 71.6%; p=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (stages 0-I), there was no significant difference in 5-year patient survival rate between the two groups (100% versus 92.6%, respectively; p=0.406) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In spite of a poor prognosis of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the transplant group, the early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of the transplant group showed a comparable oncologic outcome compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regular screening and early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are essential in the post-transplant setting </plain></SENT>
