<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and can function as oncogenes or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors depending on the target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, using qRT-PCR, we examined the expression of six miRNAs (miR-21, miR-31, miR-92a, miR-101, miR-106a and miR-145) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from 193 prospectively recruited patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and associations with clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The miRNAs were chosen based on previous studies for their biomarker potential and suggested biological relevance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The miRNA expression was examined by qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between miRNA expression and clinicopathological variables were explored using Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis test while survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MiR-101 was hardly expressed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, while for the other miRNAs, variable expression levels and expression ranges were observed, with miR-21 being most abundantly expressed relative to the reference (RNU44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our study cohort, major clinical significance was demonstrated only for miR-31, as high expression was associated with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and poor differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found between expression of the investigated miRNAs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Investigating the expression of six miRNAs previously identified as candidate biomarkers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, few clinically relevant associations were detected in our patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results emphasize the importance of validating potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers in independent patient cohorts, and indicate that the role of miRNAs as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> biomarkers is still undetermined </plain></SENT>
