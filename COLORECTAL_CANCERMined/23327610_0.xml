<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> is highly hydrophilic, and therefore, its ability to accumulate intracellularly is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a strategy to improve <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> uptake into cells has been investigated by encapsulating the compound in a hydrogel-based <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi>/alginate nanoparticle formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nanoparticles of 560 nm in diameter entrapping 9.1 Î¼g of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> per mg of formulation were produced and examined in cell-based assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These particles were endocytosed into human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> HCT116 cells and elicited a more potent photocytotoxic effect than free drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies targeting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor 5 (DR5), a cell surface <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing receptor up-regulated in various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and found on HCT116 cells, were then conjugated onto the particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conjugated antibodies further enhanced uptake and cytotoxic potency of the nanoparticle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results show that antibody-conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi>/alginate nanoparticles significantly enhanced the therapeutic effectiveness of entrapped <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This novel approach provides a strategy for providing targeted site-specific delivery of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> and other photosensitizer drugs to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> using <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
