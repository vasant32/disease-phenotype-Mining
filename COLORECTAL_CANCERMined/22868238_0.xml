<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> have generally demonstrated improvements in locoregional relapse but not survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: We compared therapy and outcomes of colon versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in 2 time cohorts to determine if relative improvements have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS:: Patients with resected stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> referred to the British Columbia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Agency in 1989/1990 and 2001/2002 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The higher of clinical or pathologic stage was used for patients receiving preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were compared for rectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> between the 2 cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: A total of 1427 patients were included, with 375 from 1989/1990 and 1052 from 2001/2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between 1989/1990 and 2001/2002 there were significant increases in the use of perioperative chemotherapy for both rectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001) and use of preoperative radiation therapy (P&lt;0.001) and total mesorectal excision (P&lt;0.001) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DSS significantly improved for rectal (P&lt;0.001) but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (P=0.069) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five-year OS was significantly inferior for rectal versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in 1989/1990 (46.1% vs. 57.2%, P=0.023) and was similar to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in 2001/2002 (63.7% vs. 66.2%, P=0.454) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Advances in locoregional and systemic therapy significantly improved survival among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DSS and OS are now similar between colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> for both stage II and III disease </plain></SENT>
