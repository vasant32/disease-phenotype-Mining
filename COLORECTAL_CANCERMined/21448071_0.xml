<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening guidelines recommend average-risk screening up to the age of 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, increasing life span and incidence of proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> could require changes to the age guidelines and adapting screening methodology for the elderly persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we reviewed our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> epidemiology, international screening age-guidelines, and screening tests for the elderly persons and presented our long-term results of colonoscopy and semi-quantitated immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (I-FOBTs) in individuals that are 75 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the Israel National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (INCR) data to assess the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in individuals aged 75 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We re-examined files of patients aged 75 years or more, who underwent both colonoscopy and three I-FOBTs, and followed them through the INCR to identify new cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nationwide, during 2005 and 2007, 41.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> occurred in individuals aged 75 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both I-FOBT and colonoscopy were performed on 271 individuals (mean age: 78.5 years, standard deviation: 3.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both initial colonoscopy and I-FOBT of at least 50 ngHb/ml buffer in either of the first two tests identified six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; INCR registered another stage 1 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the initial sensitivity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of either test was 85.7% (95% confidence interval: 59.8 and 112), valid during a mean of 44.3 months and a standard deviation of 13.4 at INCR follow-up; 14 of 27 advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> were identified by I-FOBT, giving a sensitivity of 58.8% (95% confidence interval: 42.3 and 75.4) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recently, 41.3% of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> occurred in individuals aged 75 years or more, diagnosed clinically and not by screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>I-FOBT and initial colonoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> sensitivity were similar, both having false-negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Screening age guidelines need reconsideration; our initial results show that semi-quantitated I-FOBT screening is feasible but needs large-scale evaluation in 'healthy' elderly persons </plain></SENT>
