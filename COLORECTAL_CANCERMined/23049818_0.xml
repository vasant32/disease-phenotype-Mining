<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fecal tests (occult blood, methylation) engender excellent patient compliance but lack requisite performance underscoring the need for better population screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the utility of microRNAs (miRNAs) as markers of field <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and their potential role for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening using the azoxymethane (AOM)-treated rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that 63 miRNAs were upregulated and miR-122, miR-296-5p and miR-503# were downregulated in the uninvolved colonic mucosa of AOM rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We monitored the expression of selected miRNAs in colonic biopsies of AOM rats at 16 weeks and correlated it with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We noted that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bearing rats had significantly greater miRNA modulation compared to those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The miRNAs showed good diagnostic performance with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of &gt;0.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also noted that the miRNA induction in the colonic mucosa was mirrorred in the mucus layer fecal colonocytes isolated from AOM rat stool and the degree of miRNA induction was greater in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bearing rats compared to those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we also noted significant miRNA modulation in the Pirc rats- the genetic model of colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, both in the uninvolved colonic mucosa and the fecal colonocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We thus demonstrate that miRNAs are excellent markers of field <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and could accurately predict future <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, we propose an accurate, inexpensive, non-invasive miRNA test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk stratification based on rectal brushings or from abraded fecal colonocytes </plain></SENT>
