<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relation between serum adiponectin and resistin levels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in 36 CRC patients and 37 controls was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Insulin and homeostasis model assessment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (HOMA-IR) levels were higher, and adiponectin levels were significantly decreased in patients versus controls, whereas, resistin levels were significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation between adiponectin, HOMA-IR, and insulin and a positive correlation between HOMA-IR, insulin, and stage were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the stage and resistin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin level negatively correlated with the stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin and resistin could play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, and adiponectin could be responsible for poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
