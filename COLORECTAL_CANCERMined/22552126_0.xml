<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In Spain, an increase in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has been observed in both sexes in recent years, probably due to an improved diagnostic, the westernization of dietary habits, and worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> levels, among others factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rate trends in different health areas in Navarre (northern Spain) are studied during the 1990-2005 period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An estimated incidence trend curve for each health area and the corresponding confidence bands were obtained for each gender using P-spline models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These results show an increasing trend of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in most of the areas in both sexes, being less pronounced in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the central area of Pamplona (the capital) a decreasing trend has been observed for men during the period studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Primary prevention is the best strategy to change the increasing trend observed in most areas of the province of Navarre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a healthy lifestyle has long-term results, so it is important to have an early detection program that would serve as a short-term prevention strategy </plain></SENT>
