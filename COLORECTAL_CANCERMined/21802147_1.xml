<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Population exposure to emissions from multiple industrial sources, though little studied, is an aspect of great interest from an epidemiologic standpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether risk of dying due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017185" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors of the digestive system</z:e> in populations residing in the vicinity of Spanish metal production and processing installations increases with proximity to a greater number of industrial facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An ecologic study was designed to ascertain municipal mortality due to <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> of the digestive system (oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gallbladder and colon-rectum) during the period 1994-2003, in Spanish regions with the presence of multiple industrial sources in the metal sector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Population exposure to pollution was estimated on the basis of distance from town of residence to pollution source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using Poisson regression models, we analyzed: the increased risk of dying of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with proximity to a given number of sources; and excess mortality in the vicinity of specific industrial clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responsible for the greatest number of regions with increased risk in both sexes was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> (78% of the regions, being statistically significant in Valencia (p-value for trend (p trend)=0.001 in both sexes), Madrid (p trend=0.011 in women) and the Basque Country (p trend=0.002 in men)), followed by colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancers</z:hpo> (56% of the regions, being statistically significant in both sexes in Valencia (p trend=0.001) and Zaragoza (p trend=0.018) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; and Valladolid (p trend=0.019 in men) and Barcelona (p trend=0.049 in women) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Valencia was the province that displayed increased risk with the proximity to metal industries for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> studied, while the Basque Country was the Autonomous Region that registered a rising risk trend for liver, stomach and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> with proximity (≤5 km) to a greater number of sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results could support the hypothesis that mortality due to certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017185" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors of the digestive system</z:e> increases with proximity (≤5 km) to a greater number of metal industry sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in this type of ecologic study, conclusions cannot be obtained in terms of cause and effect, nor can individual inferences be made from grouped data </plain></SENT>
