<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ex vivo culture of fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues provides a feasible way to explore potential serum biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> early detection under near-physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we applied a lectin affinity based approach to enrich and increase the detection number of secreted proteins in the conditioned media of cultured tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The captured proteins were then analyzed by the proteomic strategy of one-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By quantification with label-free spectral counting, we found 123 differentially expressed secreted proteins (DESPs) with 68 DESPs up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EFEMP2, one of the top 10 up-regulated DESPs, was further validated by immunohistochemistry at tissue level and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at serum level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found the expression level of EFEMP2 was dramatically increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, even at the early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of EFEMP2 was superior to the established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen evidenced by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the two biomarkers were 0.923 and 0.728, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicated EFEMP2 is a promising serum biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> early detection </plain></SENT>
