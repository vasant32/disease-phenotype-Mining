<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The women's health initiative (WHI) study sample was used to determine whether differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors explain racial/ethnic differences in incidence and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The WHI is a longitudinal study of postmenopausal women recruited from 40 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline questionnaires were used to collect sociodemographic and health status information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnoses were centrally adjudicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study sample included 131,481 (83.7%) White, 14,323 (9.1%) African-American, 6,362 (4.1%) Hispanic, 694 (0.4%) Native American and 4,148 (2.6%) Asian/Pacific Islanders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 10.8 years (SD 2.9), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence was the highest in African-Americans (annualized rate = 0.14%), followed by Whites and Native Americans (0.12% each), Asian/Pacific Islanders (0.10%), and Hispanics (0.08%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and trial assignment, Hispanics had a lower risk compared with Whites, HR 0.73 (95% CI: 0.54-0.97) (P = 0.03), and African-Americans had a marginally greater risk, HR 1.16 (95% CI: 0.99-1.34), P = 0.06 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariable adjustment attenuated the difference in incidence between African-Americans and Whites (HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.82-1.20), while strengthening the lower HR for Hispanics (HR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: African-American/White differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk are likely due to sociodemographic/cultural factors other than race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: A number of modifiable exposures could be a focus for reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in African-Americans </plain></SENT>
