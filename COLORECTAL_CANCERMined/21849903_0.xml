<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We selected for the study <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals (n=11 969) screened by a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program in 2004 and who were eligible for rescreening in two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A multilevel logistic regression model was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contextual variables were the percentage of people with less than primary studies and the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The individual variables used were: sex, age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (prior to 2004), guaiac fecal occult blood test result, ease of recruitment, and number of tests used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rescreening rate was 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences according to sex and age were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strongest barrier for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> rescreening was an inconclusive fecal occult blood test result at baseline screening [odds ratio (OR): 0.24; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.20-0.29] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals who agreed to participate just after receiving the screening invitation were more likely to accept a second screen compared with those who received a reminder letter six weeks later (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.36-1.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those individuals who lived in a neighborhood with a higher educational level were more willing to rescreen (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.45) than those who lived in more deprived areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rescreening was highly adequate in our program, reflecting satisfaction with the service received at screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strategies to enhance initial screening participation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and to improve quality throughout the screening process should be prioritized </plain></SENT>
