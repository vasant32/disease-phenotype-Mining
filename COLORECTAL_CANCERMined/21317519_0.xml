<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated descriptive statistics by region, provider type, and workplace setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most respondents (77%) recommend starting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening of average-risk patients at age 50; however, 22% recommend flexible sigmoidoscopy and 43% colonoscopy at intervals inconsistent with national guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those recommending fecal occult blood test (FOBT), 23% use a single, in-office FOBT card as their only FOBT method </plain></SENT>
