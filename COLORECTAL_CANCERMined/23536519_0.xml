<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">Resveratrol</z:chebi> inhibited the proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) equal to 50 and 130 μM for HCT116 and Caco2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Caco2 cells appeared with significant time-dependent increase in the glycolytic pathway, a behaviour that was absent in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">Resveratrol</z:chebi> (100 μM) significantly decreased the glycolytic enzymes (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase) in Caco2 cells, while an increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase activity and a decrease in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> consumption were observed in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> downregulated the expressions of leptin and c-Myc, and decreased the content of vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic markers, caspases 3 and 8, were activated and the Bax/BCl2 ratio was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study suggested a promising anticancer activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>, calorie-restriction pathway may be one of the driving forces for this activity </plain></SENT>
