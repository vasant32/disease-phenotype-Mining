<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After first promising results in prospective studies an expert group developed recommendations of a modified, multimodal Fast Track Concept in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Main elements in this concept are laparoscopy, no nasogastric tubes, perioperative peridural anaesthesia and quick mobilisation of the patient after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A metaanalysis in 2011 based on the Cochrane database showed, that in most studies regarding Fast Track Surgery, the authors have not strictly followed the recommendations of the expert group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further studies with better quality and strict adaption on the multimodal principles of Fast Track Surgery are needed to gain more evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the Fast Track Concept constitutes a challenge for the interdisciplinary collaboration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involved treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Especially the postoperative outpatient treatment remains a problem due to unavailable rehabilitation capacities or ambulant care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore a proper preoperative planning of the Fast Track Concept and the outpatient care should be performed interdisciplinary by the surgeons and the general practitioners </plain></SENT>
