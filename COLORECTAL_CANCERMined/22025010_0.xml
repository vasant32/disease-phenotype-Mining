<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 57-year-old man was referred complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> after treatment with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-combined chemotherapeutic agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> development and spontaneous subsidence were observed during the chemotherapeutic course repeatedly until the 9th cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A computer-tomographic (CT) scan revealed bilateral, peripherally distributed, patchy consolidation suggestive of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a confirmative step, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical biopsy was attempted; the characteristic intraluminal organizing fibrous plug in the bronchioles and alveoli was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy was administered, which rapidly improved the patient's symptoms and chest CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> may be implicated in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo>, since withdrawal of the drug resulted in improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
