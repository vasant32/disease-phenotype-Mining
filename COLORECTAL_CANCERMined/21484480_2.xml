<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microsatellite instability (MSI) constitutes an important oncogenic molecular pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), representing approximately 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In roughly one third of the cases, the underlying DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defect is inherited through the transmission of a mutation in one of the genes involved in MMR, predominantly MSH2 and MLH1, or less frequently, MSH6 or PMS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the overwhelming number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases, MSI results from epigenetic MLH1 silencing through hypermethylation of its promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMR deficiency promotes colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> through the accumulation of numerous mutations in crucial target genes harbouring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> repeats, notably in those involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as DNA damage signalling and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In this review, we describe the molecular aspects of the MMR system and the biological consequences of its defect on the oncogenic process, and we discuss the various experimental systems used to evaluate the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs on MSI colorectal cells lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence showing that MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> differ from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> in terms of prognosis and response to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical studies that have evaluated the prognostic and predictive value of MSI status on clinical outcome in patients treated with various chemotherapy regimens used in the adjuvant setting or for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In view of this, the opportunity of a systematic MSI phenotyping in the clinical management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is further discussed </plain></SENT>
