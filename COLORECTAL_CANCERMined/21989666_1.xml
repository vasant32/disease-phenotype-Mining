<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hepatic arterial infusion pump chemotherapy (HAIPC) contributes to the prolonged survival of selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRCLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most clinically important adverse event after HAIPC with floxuridine (FUDR) is biliary <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the etiology of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HAIPC was administered to 475 consecutive patients who received HAIPC on prospective protocols from 1991 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence, clinical features, variables related to demographics, comorbidity, medical history, CRCLM, surgery, chemotherapy, and laboratory data were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An analysis of factors potentially associated with BS, defined as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0597984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biliary stricture</z:e> related to HAIPC requiring stent placement, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of BS was 5.5% (16 of 293) in patients receiving HAIPC as an adjuvant therapy after hepatectomy, and 2% (2 of 100) in patients receiving HAIPC with FUDR for unresectable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The common hepatic duct was the site most frequently affected (87.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients receiving adjuvant HAIPC, BS was associated with abnormal postoperative flow scans (18.8% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.006), postoperative infectious complications (50.0% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.002), and larger dose/cycle/weight of FUDR (2.6 vs. 2.0 mg/cycle/kg, P = 0.025) than patients without BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient died directly of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median survival was not compromised by the development of BS (BS vs. non-BS: 61.0 months [range 6.2-171.6 months] vs. 47.2 months [range 2.4-200.8 months], P = 0.316, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BS is an uncommon complication after HAIPC and does not compromise survival if adequately salvaged by stenting or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical complications as well as type and dose of intra-arterial chemotherapy may contribute to the development of BS </plain></SENT>
