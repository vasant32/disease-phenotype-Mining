<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little research has examined the association of the combination of these lifestyle factors with incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially in non-Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A protective lifestyle factor index of these six aforementioned factors was created and examined in relation to risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study is a prospective observational study of 50,466 Chinese men and women in Singapore ages 45 to 74 years during enrollment in the Singapore Chinese Health Study in 1993-1998 and followed up through 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were standardized rates and HRs of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protective levels of each lifestyle factor were independently associated with reduced age- and sex-standardized incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the factors were combined into a single protective lifestyle factor index, there was a strong, monotonic decrease in incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> with an increasing score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to participants with an index score of 0 to 3, the HRs (95% confidence intervals) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> for an index score of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9/10 were 0.58 (0.35-0.95), 0.56 (0.36-0.86), 0.50 (0.33-0.76), 0.43 (0.28-0.66), 0.39 (0.25-0.63), and 0.25 (0.12-0.54; Ptrend &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were consistent by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there was no association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increasing protective lifestyle factor index score is associated with a marked decreased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in Chinese men and women </plain></SENT>
