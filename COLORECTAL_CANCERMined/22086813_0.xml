<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients are less likely to see their primary care physicians after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a longitudinal cohort study using 1993 to 2001 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare claims data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were those with stage 0 to 1 and 2 to 3 CRC aged 67 to 89 years at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main measures included the proportion of individuals with a face-to-face primary care visit and mean annual primary care visits per patient at baseline and during 5 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fewer than half of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients visited with a primary care physician at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first year after treatment, patients with stage 0 to 1 CRC (48.9% vs 53.3%; P ≤ .001) and stage 2 to 3 CRC (43.6% vs 53.4%; P ≤ .001) significantly increased their likelihood of visiting a primary care physician from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with stage 0 to 1 CRC with a primary care visit remained relatively stable, and the proportion of patients with stage 2 to 3 CRC decreased somewhat between the first and fifth year after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings for mean annual primary care visits per patient roughly paralleled those for the proportion of individuals with a primary care visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, especially stage 2 to 3 CRC, increase rather than decrease contact with primary care providers after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More work is needed to understand the care that different physician specialties provide <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and to support their collaboration </plain></SENT>
