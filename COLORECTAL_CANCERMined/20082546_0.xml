<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to analyse the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> or a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and the results obtained in two rounds of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening pilot programme performed in L Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: males and females (50-69 years) were the target population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Together with the invitation letter, they received a questionnaire in which they were asked about <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The screening test was a guaiac-based faecal occult blood test (FOBT), and colonoscopy for positive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 25,829 FOBT were performed in 18,405 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> and a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were obtained for 9,849 and 9,865 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male sex (OR = 1.32), 60-69 years of age (OR = 1.48), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> (OR = 1.84) and history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 1.54) were independent predictors of positive FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard to colonoscopy, a greater risk of diagnosing advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was observed among men (OR = 2.47) and subjects with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 1.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programmes must have instruments that make it possible to select the candidate population and the possibility of offering a study suited to the risk of individuals who are not susceptible to population screening by means of FOBT </plain></SENT>
