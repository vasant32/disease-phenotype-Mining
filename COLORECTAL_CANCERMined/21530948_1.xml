<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted surgery is playing an increasingly important role in the last few years in the treatment of colorectal oncological disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are still no studies that objectively demonstrate the advantages of this type of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a prospective randomised study in order to compare the short-term results between colorectal robotic surgery and laparoscopic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 56 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 2008 and January 2009, were randomised and assigned to the robotic or laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, body mass index, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, conversions in each group, complications during and after surgery, and histological characteristics of the specimens obtained, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between age (P=.055), body mass index (P=.12), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location (P=.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient in the robotic group required a transfusion and none in the laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of conversions was the same in both groups, however, the preparation times and operating times were significantly longer in patients intervened using the robotic device (P=.0001 and P=.017, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences as regards the rate of complications or in the percentage of re-interventions (14.2% and 7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay of the patients was 9.3 (8.1) days in the robotic group and 9.2 (6.8) days in the laparoscopic (P=.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distal resection margin was greater in the specimen obtained using robotic surgery (P =.003) as well as the number of lymph nodes obtained in the specimen (P =.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Robotic colorectal was performed safely and effectively, and with similar clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>International Trial Number for this study is: ISRCTN60866560 </plain></SENT>
