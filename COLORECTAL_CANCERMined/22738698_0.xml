<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: to identify possible risk factors for the development of metachronous lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) which would allow to establish a post-surgical individual prognostic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: three hundred eighty-two surgically treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the incidence of metachronous lesions in 40 variables concerning patient clinical data and initial neoplastic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An individual risk index for metachronicity was drawn up including those variables which presented significant differences in multivariate logistic regression, dividing patients into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: variables with prognostic value for metachronicity were distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> location: OR = 2.30 (1.03-5.13), alcohol intake: OR = 2.20 (1.08-4.48), presence of synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>: isolated: OR = 2.47 (1.03-4.48), multiple: OR = 4.26 (1.78-10.17), and presence of synchronous advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>: OR = 2.91 (1.52-12.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> MUC-5 expression proved to have a protective role: OR = 0.23 (0.08-0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An individual risk score was established considering these variables and patients could be classified into three groups, with a discrimination power for metachronicity of p &lt; 0.0000001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Classification in high and low risk groups had a sensitivity = 75.32%, specificity = 84.21%, positive predictive value = 75.34%, negative predictive value = 92.31% and global diagnostic accuracy = 80.75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: the identification of risk factors for the development of metachronous lesions allow to calculate, at the time of surgical treatment, an individual prognostic index and to classify patients into three different risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In high and low risk groups, both specificity and accuracy were acceptable for the prognosis of metachronous lesions, being remarkable the negative predictive power of our classification, which could become relevant when planning a different endoscopic follow up of these patients </plain></SENT>
