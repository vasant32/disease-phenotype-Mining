<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To ascertain whether adding bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based CTx has an influence on liver injury and postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with CRLM who received neoadjuvant CTx and underwent resection between 2003 and 2008 were analyzed whether or not they received bevacizumab added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based CTx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total study group existed of 104 patients: 53 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based CTx and 51 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based CTx and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate (29%) was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bevacizumab group exhibited less moderate sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (8% vs. 28%, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in complication rate was found between patients given fewer than six cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based CTx and those given six or more cycles, or between patients with a short (&lt;5 weeks) interval between the last dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and resection and those in which the interval was longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based CTx may protect against moderate sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> without significantly influencing morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based CTx nor the time interval between cessation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based CTx and surgery were associated with postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
