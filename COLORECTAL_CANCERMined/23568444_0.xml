<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While a larger number of manuscripts on gender effects in gastro-intestinal and pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> have been published, urological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> involving men and women alike seem less studied in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present analysis aimed at describing the role of gender effects in general oncological and uro-oncological research and is the first such bibliometrical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The electronic database MEDLINE was searched for relevant medical subject headings from January 1991 to December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Publication types, publishing journal and impact factors were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trends were assessed by linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The numbers of annual publications on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> entities and on urological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> increased similarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the portion of publications on gender effects was below 1 % for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> entity, the annual increase of novel publications on gender effects was significant in most and prominent in pulmonary (1.87, 95 % CI 1.11-2.63; &lt;0.0001) and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (2.16, 95 % CI 1.49-2.82; &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While the annual increase of novel publications on gender effects was significant in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> (0.33, 95 % CI 0.11-0.54; 0.005), it failed level of significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007134" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">renal cell cancer</z:e> (0.25, 95 % CI -0.19-0.24; 0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While the overall role of gender effect seems small in general oncological research, it is increasing steadily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In uro-oncological research, such trend is also visible in bladder but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007134" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">renal cell cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Respective awareness on importance of gender effects should be raised </plain></SENT>
