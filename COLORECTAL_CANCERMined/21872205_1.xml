<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from a prospective database at Taipei Veterans General Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 2,738 newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 2001 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two extreme age groups, younger (≤40 years) and elderly (≥80 years), were analyzed to compare clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis after exclusion of specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 322 patients were enrolled in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The younger group consisted of 69 patients with mean age of 33.5 years, and the elderly group consisted of 253 patients with mean age of 83.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Younger patients had a higher incidence of mucinous cell type (14.5% vs 6.3%, P = .05), poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (26.1% vs 6.3%, P &lt; .001), more advanced disease (82.6% vs 41.9%, P &lt; .001), poorer disease-free survival (67.2% vs 79.3%, P = .048), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (44.1% vs 73.1%, P &lt; .001) than elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, without relevant predisposing risk factors, younger patients have more advanced stages of disease, more aggressive histopathologic characteristics, and poorer prognoses compared with older patients </plain></SENT>
