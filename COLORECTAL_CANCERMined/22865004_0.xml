<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The continuum of resistance model contends that respondents lie at one end of a continuum and non-respondents at the other with respect to factors demonstrated to impact on screening participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the validity of this model for the prediction of participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: People aged 50 to 74 years were asked to complete a survey (n = 1,250) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible respondents (n = 376, 30 %) were invited to complete a faecal occult blood test (FOBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cutoff period for the determination of participation rates was 12 weeks, with a reminder sent at 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FOBTs were returned by n = 196 people (132 within 6 weeks, 64 following a reminder) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participation was generally influenced by the same variables in both the first 6 weeks and the second 6 weeks, consistent with the continuum of resistance model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These variables were having known someone with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> and the social cognitive factor, perceptions of barriers to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a suggestion, however, that other factors may be differentially associated with early, late and non-participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Participation in screening appears somewhat consistent with the continuum of resistance model in that early and late participants respond to some of the same factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the same messages are relevant to early, late and non-screeners, but further consideration of what other factors may be influencing discrete stages of readiness to participate is necessary </plain></SENT>
