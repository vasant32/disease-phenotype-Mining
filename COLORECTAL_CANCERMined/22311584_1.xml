<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From March 2007 to September 2009, 400 patients who had been tested for MSI after newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were recruited from 30 Dutch hospitals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response rates were 23/77 (30%) in the MSI-positive patients and 58/323 (18%) in the MSI-negative patients </plain></SENT>
