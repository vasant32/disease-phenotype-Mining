<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a longitudinal study of 208 participants (62 LS mutation carriers and 146 non-carriers) who provided information on general <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (State-Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233705" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of cancer</z:e> and dying, satisfaction with life, risk and test perceptions, and surveillance behaviour in the baseline questionnaire before testing, and 1 month, 1 year and 7 years post-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 7 years, most of the psychosocial variables remained unchanged, regardless of mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carriers tended to underestimate their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk but were more worried about their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk than their counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-carriers reported a higher degree of satisfaction with their testing decisions (P &lt; 0.05), but had more doubts concerning test result validity than carriers (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> carriers attended a post-test colonoscopy surveillance, while 16 % of non-carriers reported colonoscopy examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those non-carriers with doubts about test validity were more likely (P = 0.019) to report post-test colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the carriers, 17 % had an interval longer than 3 years between their colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fear of dying soon, measured at 1-month post-test follow-up was the only psychosocial variable predicting non-compliance in recommended surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No adverse psychosocial consequences were detected, and respondents were satisfied with their decision to testing 7 years post-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the carriers, solely fear of dying soon predicted non-compliance in recommended surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some non-carriers were still worried about their risk and had doubts about the validity of their genetic testing results predicting post-test colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
