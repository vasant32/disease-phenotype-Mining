<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Members of the human kallikrein-related peptidases gene family represent potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of human tissue kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6) by immunohistochemistry in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> to correlate this expression with various histopathological and clinical variables, and to evaluate its significance as a predictor of disease outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KLK6 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and an expression score was calculated for each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, KLK6 expression was decreased compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant, positive association was observed between KLK6 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage (p=0.036), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> (p=0.030), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that KLK6 expression and stage had statistically significant correlation with disease-free survival (p=0.045 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) and overall survival (p=0.027 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox multivariate analysis showed that KLK6 expression was an independent predictor of unfavorable overall survival (p=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that KLK6-positive patients have statistically significant lower disease-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, KLK6 immunostaining is an independent prognostic marker in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
