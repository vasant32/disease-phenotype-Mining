<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report the long-term outcomes of a randomized controlled trial performed between 1986 and 1991 to compare the effects of allogeneic blood transfusions and an autologous blood transfusion program in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 475 randomized patients operated upon for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were tracked via a national computerized record-linkage system to investigate survival and cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to study 20 years' overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival was analyzed over the 10-year time period after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall survival percentage at 20 years after surgery was worse in the autologous group (21%) compared to the allogeneic group (28%) (P = 0.041; log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression, allowing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, age, and sex, resulted in a hazard ratio (autologous vs allogeneic group) for overall mortality of 1.24 (95% confidence interval 1.00-1.54; P = 0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival at 10 years for the whole study group was 48% and 60% for the autologous and allogeneic group, respectively (P = 0.020; log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.39 (95 confidence interval 1.05-1.83; P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At long-term follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients did not benefit from autologous transfusion compared with standard allogeneic transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the overall and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival rates were worse in the patients in the autologous transfusion group </plain></SENT>
