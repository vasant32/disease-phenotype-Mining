<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the relationship between the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and the expression of MMPs at the same colonic sites in ICRC models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To develop ICRC models, mice were administered a single intraperitoneal dose (10 mg/kg) of azoxymethane (AOM) and exposed orally to 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS) for one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 expression and β-catenin activation in colonic lesions were characterized by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After being treated with inducers for some time, cancerous lesions were found to express high β-catenin and MMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The profiles of MMP expression were correlated with β-catenin activation in the colonic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>c(KAHWGFTLD)NH(2) (C6) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was prepared by standard Fmoc <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> synthesis to target MMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular weight of Cy5.5-C6 was 1,954.78 g/mol (calculated MW = 1955.23 g/mol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The in vitro characterization of Cy5.5-C6 showed MMP binding specificity in a cell experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vivo NIRF imaging showed high accumulation of Cy5.5-C6 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with associated expression of MMP-2 in colonic lesions after intravenous injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MMP-2 specificity of Cy5.5-C6 was confirmed by successful inhibition of probe uptake in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> due to the presence of excess C6 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of Cy5.5-C6 to target MMP-2 has the potential to be developed into an effective molecular imaging agent to monitor ICRC progress </plain></SENT>
