<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Dutch Health Council recently recommended the introduction of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening programme by faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) for individuals aged 55-75 at population risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals at an increased familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (â‰¥ 2 times population risk) should be identified at a younger age, so they and their relatives can receive earlier, more intensive surveillance instead of FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the percentage of participants with a positive FOBT in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programme with an increased familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a population-based study, 10,569 individuals aged 50-75 received an FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with a positive FOBT were invited for colonoscopy and familial risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants with an average familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were compared to those with an increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was defined as a cumulative lifetime risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of at least 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 6001 participants, 430 had a positive FOBT, of whom 324 (63% males; mean age 63 years) completed colonoscopy and familial risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n=22) and/or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (n=122) were found in 133 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was increased in 6% of participants with a positive FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between participants with an average versus an increased familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Six percent of participants with a positive FOBT had an increased familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Identifying at-risk participants enables them and their relatives to undergo regular colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adding familial risk assessment to FOBT screening may thus prevent a substantial number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
