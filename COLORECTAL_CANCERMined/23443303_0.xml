<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate if human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) population is getting adequate screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in the highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) era with improved longevity, and the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in this population, when compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted retrospective chart review of average-risk HIV population for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> attending our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individuals who underwent diagnostic colonoscopy were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We extracted various demographic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV disease</z:e>-specific and colonoscopy data including histo-pathological reports in the last 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total population was divided into a study group, who underwent screening colonoscopy and a control group who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data using standard statistical methods and software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 25% of average-risk HIV-infected population was screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> using colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in gender and ethnic distribution between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found wider distribution of age (50-84 years with mean 56 years) in the control group when compared to (50-73 years with mean 58 years) the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there were 89% of subjects with well-controlled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV disease</z:e> measured by HIV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> copies of &lt; 75 in the study group when compared with 70% in the control group (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We noticed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate of 55% and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate of 32% in HIV population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is unclear whether HIV or HAART medications play a role in increased prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that when estimating the risk for colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, HIV population should be considered as a high-risk group and screened accordingly </plain></SENT>
