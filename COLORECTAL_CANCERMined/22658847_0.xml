<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 130 patients (87 male and 43 female; age range 49-86 years, mean 71.1) were selected whose diagnoses were pathologically confirmed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036323" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">schistosomiasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent abdominal plain CT and contrast enhanced scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The location, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, size, calcification features and enhancement modalities (patterns) were evaluated and compared with the pathological findings by two radiologists in a blind way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CT showed that in 130 patients, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> occurred in the large intestine, among which 109 (83.9%) were solitary and 21 (16.1%) were multifocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intestinal wall was irregularly thickened in 123 patients, with soft tissue masses in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear, spotty and small patchy calcifications were seen in 104 (80.0%) patients, with unclear margins in 96 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were markedly unevenly enhanced in 92 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 114 patients and in 104 patients, calcified Shistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) ova inside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 15 patients were mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and one patient was that of adenosquamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Irregular thickening of the intestinal wall, soft tissue masses, multiple S. japonicum ova calcifications inside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with obscured margins and multiple intestinal masses in some patients are important CT features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036323" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">schistosomiasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
