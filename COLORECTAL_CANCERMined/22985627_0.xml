<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined this issue in secondary analyses from a randomized controlled trial of a tailored <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening intervention, stratified by ethnicity/language subgroups (Hispanic/Spanish, Hispanic/English, non-Hispanic/English) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Logistic regressions compared effects of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening knowledge-tailored intervention versus a non-tailored control on preferences for specific test options (fecal occult blood or colonoscopy), in the entire sample (N=1164) and the three ethnicity/language subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-intervention, preferences for specific tests did not differ significantly between study groups (experimental, 64.5%; control 62.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-intervention, more experimental participants (78.6%) than control participants (67.7%) preferred specific tests (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for pre-intervention preferences, more experimental group participants than control group participants preferred specific tests post-intervention [average marginal effect (AME)=9.5%, 95% CI 5.3-13.6; P&lt;0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AMEs were similar across ethnicity/language subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Knowledge tailoring increased preferences for specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests across ethnic and language groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: If the observed preference changes are found to translate into behavior changes, then knowledge tailoring alone may enhance healthy behaviors </plain></SENT>
