<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Randomized controlled trial (N=60), comparing the effects of experimental and control <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening texts on recognition memory, measured using a statement recognition test, accounting for response bias (score range -0.91 to 5.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experimental text had a lower Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level (7.4 versus 9.6), was more focused on addressing screening barriers, and employed more comparative tables than the control text </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recognition memory was higher in the experimental group (2.54 versus 1.09, t=-3.63, P=0.001), including after adjustment for age, education, and health literacy (β=0.42, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.68, P=0.001), and in analyses limited to persons with college degrees (β=0.52, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.86, P=0.004) or no self-reported health literacy problems (β=0.39, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.71, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening text improved recognition memory, including among patients with high education and self-assessed health literacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening texts comparable to our experimental text may be warranted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screening-eligible patients, if such texts improve screening uptake </plain></SENT>
