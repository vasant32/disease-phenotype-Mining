<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluating CRCS trends can help identify shifts in CRCS, and specific groups that might be targeted for CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We utilized medical records to describe population-based adherence to average-risk CRCS guidelines from 1997 to 2008 in Olmsted County, MN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRCS trends were analyzed overall and by gender, age, and adherence to screening mammography (women only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also carried out an analysis to examine whether CRCS is being initiated at the recommended age of 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1997 to 2008, the size of the total eligible sample ranged from 20,585 to 21,468 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CRCS increased from 22% to 65% for women and from 17% to 59% for men (P &lt; 0.001 for both) between 1997 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CRCS among women current with mammography screening increased from 26% to 74%, and this group was more likely to be adherent to CRCS than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other subgroups analyzed (P &lt; 0.001).The mean ages of screening initiation were stable throughout the study period, with a mean age of 55 years among both men and women in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although overall CRCS tripled during the study period, there is still room for improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Impact: Working to decrease the age at first screening, exploration of gender differences in screening behavior, and targeting women adherent to mammography but not to CRCS seem warranted </plain></SENT>
