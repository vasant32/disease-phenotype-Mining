<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vessels, as well as the reversibility of this effect, using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and histology in patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 12 patients who received chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, experienced a reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vascularity as demonstrated by CEUS and consequently underwent liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CEUS was performed before and after four courses of chemotherapy and before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The numbers of microvessels highlighted by anti-CD34 antibodies in the viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue were counted to quantify the microvessel density (MVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a control, 12 surgical specimens from 12 patients who had not received chemotherapy were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A reversal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vascularity was observed in 10 of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the vascularity remained reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MVD in the treatment group was significantly lower than that observed in the group without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vessels regenerated substantially, although the effect of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab remained weak for approximately 6 weeks after the cessation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, future research must determine whether bevacizumab should be used prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
