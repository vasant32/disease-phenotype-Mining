<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The promise of widespread implementation of efficacious interventions across the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> continuum into routine practice and policy has yet to be realized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multilevel influences, such as communities and families surrounding patients or health-care policies and organizations surrounding provider teams, may determine whether effective interventions are successfully implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Greater recognition of the importance of these influences in advancing (or hindering) the impact of single-level interventions has motivated the design and testing of multilevel interventions designed to address them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, implementing research evidence from single- or multilevel interventions into sustainable routine practice and policy presents substantive challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, relatively few multilevel interventions have been conducted along the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care continuum, and fewer still have been implemented, disseminated, or sustained in practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this chapter is, therefore, to illustrate and examine the concepts underlying the implementation and spread of multilevel interventions into routine practice and policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We accomplish this goal by using a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and noncancer examples that have been successfully implemented and, in some cases, spread widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Key concepts across these examples include the importance of phased implementation, recognizing the need for pilot testing, explicit engagement of key stakeholders within and between each intervention level; visible and consistent leadership and organizational support, including financial and human resources; better understanding of the policy context, fiscal climate, and incentives underlying implementation; explication of handoffs from researchers to accountable individuals within and across levels; ample integration of multilevel theories guiding implementation and evaluation; and strategies for long-term monitoring and sustainability </plain></SENT>
