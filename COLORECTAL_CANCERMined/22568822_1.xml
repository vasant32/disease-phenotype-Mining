<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The oncogenic transformation by cell-free nucleic acids circulating in plasma has been named as genometastasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of this phenomenon has been demonstrated and now it is necessary to value the impact of this phenomenon and to determine what conditions could promote or inhibit it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to examine the transforming ability of plasma from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in a long-term follow-up after the surgical excision of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, and to try correlate it with the clinical picture of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were taken from eight patients with K-ras-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, who were under surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection at least 2 years before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma was isolated by two centrifugations and added to cultures of NIH-3T3 cells and human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two cases, plasma was separated from cells by a membrane with 0.4-Î¼m pores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of mutated and non-mutated human K-ras sequences was tested by real-time PCR in cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 30 days, cells were subcutaneously injected into athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice in order to test their ability to generate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In four of the eight patients analyzed after surgery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA was detected in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasmas from three of them were able to oncogenically transform NIH-3T3 cells in culture and, when those cells were injected in mice, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a 2-year follow-up, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were found in two of the three patients whose plasmas were able to transform cells, and in two of the four in whom plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, after a mean follow-up of 29.5 months, only four of 13 patients (30.8%) were alive and disease-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Primary tumor</z:e> resection does not assure a complete clean of blood of circulating oncogenes, in spite of a disease-free clinical picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in some cases plasma kept their oncogenic capabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The value of these findings as prognosis factor remains unclear and needs further investigations </plain></SENT>
