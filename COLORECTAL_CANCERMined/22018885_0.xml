<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The risk of recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> after curative surgery can be estimated by using decision <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> use pathologic and patient factors to predict recurrence risk after adjuvant chemotherapy and have been validated when using clinical trial populations; however, the performance of 2 decision <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> were compared by using a cohort of patients treated at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient data were used to estimate the risk of recurrence when using both the Adjuvant! for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and Memorial Sloan Kettering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center (MSKCC) decision <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyzed the predicted chance of being disease free at 5 years against the actual outcome for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This curve was then used to define cutoff points at a chosen sensitivity and specificity to stratify patients into risk groups, and survival curves for each group calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data on 134 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Pearson correlation between the 2 nomograms was 0.848 (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ROC curve for the MSKCC nomogram had an area under the curve of 0.638 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a sensitivity and a specificity of 0.8, the MSKCC curve has a risk recurrence score of 69% and 84%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By using these cutoffs to stratify patients into 3 risk groups, a statistically significant difference in survival was found between high risk and low risk (P = .025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tools to predict risk or recurrence and estimate benefit from therapy may be enhanced in the future by using genetic profiling, but use of existing tools can help deliver a personalized approach to adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
