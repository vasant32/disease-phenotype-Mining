<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate genetics of two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> local recurrence and throw some light on the etiopathogenesis of anastomotic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two cases are presented: a 65-year-old female receiving two colonic resections for primary anastomotic recurrences within 21 mo, and a 57-year-old female undergoing two local excisions of recurrent anastomotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> within 26 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A loss of heterozygosity (LOH) study of 25 microsatellite markers and a mutational analysis of genes BRAF, K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and APC were performed in samples of neoplastic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa collected over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A diffuse genetic instability was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, including neoplastic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two different patterns of genetic alterations (LOH at 5q21 and 18p11.23 in the first case, and LOH at 1p34 and 3p14 in the second) were found to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A role for the genes MYC-L (mapping at 1p34) and FIHT (mapping at 3p14.2) is suggested, whereas a role for APC (mapping at 5q21) is not shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study challenges the most credited intraluminal implantation and metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> theories, and suggests a persistent, patient-specific alteration as the trigger of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> anastomotic recurrence </plain></SENT>
