<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combination of Aurora and SRC inhibitors selectively killed cells that have undergone a preceding aberrant mitosis, and was associated with a postmitotic reattachment defect, and selective removal of aneuploid cell populations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SRC and AURKA share a common interaction partner, NEDD9, which serves as a scaffolding protein with activities in cell attachment and mitotic control, suggesting SRC and AURKA might interact directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, we observed physical interaction and mutual cross-phosphorylation between SRC and AURKA that enhanced SRC kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings suggest that combination of SRC and Aurora-targeting inhibitors in the clinic may be a productive strategy </plain></SENT>
