<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is stage-specific, multidisciplinary, and based on patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although especially early stages (0-III, according to Union for International <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Control) are treated with curative intent, patients with limited stage IV disease (liver and/or lung or localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e>) might still be curable in a multimodality approach including surgery, perioperative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the broad variety of prognostic factors, treatment decisions and selection of drugs are mainly based on clinicopathologic variables for early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, extent of disease, potential resectability, patients' eligibility to receive aggressive treatments including chemotherapy, surgery, and very few molecular markers such as KRAS mutational status for advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a tailored approach for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> taking into account <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mentioned factors is currently recommended by national and international guidelines and will be discussed in this review </plain></SENT>
