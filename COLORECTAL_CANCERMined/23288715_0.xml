<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the modified double-stapling technique (MDST), as an alternative for conventional double-stapling technique (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>), and whether it could reduce the anastomotic leakage rate in laparoscopic anterior resection (Lapa-AR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Between March 2009 and October 2010, a total of 189 patients who underwent Lapa-AR for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the sigmoid colon or rectosigmoid colon were divided into the MDST group (n = 95) and the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> group (n = 94) according to the anastomotic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morbidity and anastomotic leakage rate were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient demographics, preoperative comorbidity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, stage, and operative details were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in operation time between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate was significantly lower in the MDST group than in the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> group (3.2 vs. 10.6 %, p = 0.042), including anastomotic leakage rate (0 vs.4.6 %, p = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anastomotic technique was the only factor associated with anastomotic leakage in univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative study demonstrates MDST to have better short-term outcome in reducing anastomotic leakage compared with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This technique could be an alternative approach to maximize the patients' benefit in laparoscopic anterior resection </plain></SENT>
