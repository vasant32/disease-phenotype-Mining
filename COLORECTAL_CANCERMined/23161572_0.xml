<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified 20 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amongst these, four of the signals are defined by tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on regions 14q22.2 (rs4444235 and rs1957636) and 20p12.3 (rs961253 and rs4813802) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These markers are located close to two of the genes involved in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling (BMP4 and BMP2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By investigating these four SNPs in an initial cohort of Spanish origin, we found substantial evidence that minor allele frequencies (MAFs) may be different in northern and southern European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we genotyped three additional southern European cohorts comprising a total of 2028 cases and 4273 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis results show that only one of the association signals (rs961253) is effectively replicated in the southern European populations, despite adequate power to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other three SNPs (rs4444235, rs1957636 and rs4813802) presented discordant results in MAFs and linkage disequilibrium patterns between northern and southern European cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that this lack of replication could be the result of differential tagging of the functional variant in both sets of populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Were this true, it would have complex consequences in both our ability to understand the nature of the real causative variants, as well as for further study designs </plain></SENT>
