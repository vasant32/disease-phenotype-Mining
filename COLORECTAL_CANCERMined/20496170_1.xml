<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine demographic and psychosocial factors associated with participation in faecal occult blood test (FOBT)-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening in an average risk community programme in Adelaide, South Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A questionnaire consistent with the Preventive Health Model was used to determine demographic and psychosocial differences between previous FOBT-based screening participants (n = 413, response rate 93.2%) and non-participants (n = 481, response rate 47.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were analysed by univariate and multivariate generalised linear modelling, and factors associated with participation were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Factor analysis of psychosocial items revealed an optimal three-factor solution (knowledge, faecal aversion, belief in the value of screening) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following multivariate analyses, two psychosocial and two demographic factors remained as predictors of FOBT screening behaviour: (1) items related to faecal aversion (Aversion), relative risk (RR)â€‰= 0.61, CI = 0.55-0.69, (2) perceptions about the value of screening (Value), RR = 1.45, CI = 1.13-1.85, (3) age band 65-69 (Age, five age bands, relative to age 50-54), RR = 1.43, CI = 1.16-1.76 and FOBT type (Test; three tests, Hemoccult, FlexSure, InSure randomly assigned, relative to Hemoccult: FlexSure: RR = 1.41, CI = 1.17-1.71, InSure: RR = 1.76, CI = 1.47-2.11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The psychosocial factors associated with non-participation in FOBT-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening are amenable to interventions designed to improve participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The small relative risks values associated with each predictor, however, raise the possibility that additional factors are likely to influence screening participation </plain></SENT>
