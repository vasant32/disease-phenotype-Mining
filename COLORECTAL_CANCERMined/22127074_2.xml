<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the rate of use of laparoscopic colorectal surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at academic medical centers and to evaluate if the site of surgery influences the rate of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data of patients who underwent laparoscopic or open colon and rectal resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> from 2007 to 2009 were obtained from the University HealthSystem Consortium database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data concerning rate of laparoscopy, length of stay, morbidity, and risk-adjusted mortality were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 36-month study period, 22,780 operations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall rate for use of laparoscopy was 14.8 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopy was most often used for total colectomy (22.6%), sigmoid colectomy (17.3%), cecectomy (17.1%), and right hemicolectomy (17.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopy was most infrequently used for abdominoperineal resection (8.0%), transverse colectomy (10.0%), and left hemicolectomy (13.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Length of stay for laparoscopic colon and rectal procedures was 3.2 days shorter than for open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the benefits of laparoscopic colorectal surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> have been demonstrated, the use of laparoscopy for colorectal resection remains under 20 per cent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and under 10 per cent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine the factors limiting the use of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
