<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab has received considerable attention as a first-line treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Difficulties associated with effectively monitoring the activity of this drug have prompted us to seek a pharmacodynamic marker suitable for defining the optimum biological dose and schedule of bevacizumab administration against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in early clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated inhibitory effects of bevacizumab on VEGF signaling and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in vitro and in vivo, and assessed phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and downstream signaling in endothelial cells as pharmacodynamic markers using phospho-flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also validated markers in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with bevacizumab-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In in vitro studies, bevacizumab inhibited proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in association with reduced VEGF signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, bevacizumab inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo, treatment with bevacizumab inhibited growth of xenografted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and attenuated VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median percentages of VEGFR2 + pAkt + and VEGFR2 + pERK + cells, determined by phospho-flow cytometry, were approximately 3-fold higher in mCRC patients than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab treatment decreased VEGFR2 + pAkt + cells in 18 of 24 patients on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy decreased the number of VEGFR2 + pAkt + cells, reflecting impaired VEGFR2 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, these data suggest that changes in the proportion of circulating VEGFR2 + pAkt + cells may be a potential pharmacodynamic marker of the efficacy of antiangiogenic agents, and could prove valuable in determining drug dosage and administration schedule </plain></SENT>
