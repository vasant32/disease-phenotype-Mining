<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorocoxib A, N-[(5-carboxy-X-rhodaminyl)but-4-yl]-2-[1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-5-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-1H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16881">indol</z:chebi>-3-yl]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27856">acetamide</z:chebi>, selectively binds and inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is overexpressed in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Safety pilot studies were performed in research dogs following intravenous (i.v.) administration of 0.1 and 1  mg/kg fluorocoxib A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood and urine samples collected three days after administration of each dose of fluorocoxib A revealed no evidence of toxicity, and no clinically relevant adverse events were noted on physical examination of exposed dogs over that time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in additional research dogs from plasma collected at several time points after i.v. administration of fluorocoxib A using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetic studies using 1  mg/kg showed a peak of fluorocoxib A (92±28  ng/ml) in plasma collected at 0.5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> specific uptake of fluorocoxib A was demonstrated using a dog diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> expressing COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data support the safe single-dose administration and in vivo efficacy of fluorocoxib A, suggesting a high potential for successful translation to clinical use as an imaging agent for improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> detection in humans </plain></SENT>
