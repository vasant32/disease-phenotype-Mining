<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various methods for identifying screening colonoscopies have been used and it is unclear how different definitions affect the estimated polypectomy rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate polypectomy rates and how they vary according to the definition of a screening colonoscopy, using patient- and endoscopist-reported indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of endoscopists and their patients 50 to 75 years of age who underwent colonoscopy was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on questionnaire responses, four patient indications were derived: perceived screening; perceived nonscreening; medical history indicating nonscreening; and combination of the three indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopist indication was derived from a questionnaire completed immediately after colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polypectomy status was obtained from provincial physician billing records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polypectomy rates were computed, while accounting for physician and hospital level clustering, using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patient indications, endoscopist indication, and the agreement between patient and endoscopist indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of indications on polypectomy rate was estimated adjusting for age, sex and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2134 patients and 45 endoscopists were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proportion of colonoscopies classified as screening according to the nine indications ranged from 32.2% to 70.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Polypectomy rates ranged between 22.6% and 26.2% for screening colonoscopy, and between 27.1% and 30.8% for nonscreening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Adjusted ORs for indication ranged between 0.74 and 0.94 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Although the proportion of colonoscopies identified as screening varied considerably among the indications, the estimated polypectomy rates were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the way screening is defined does not greatly affect the estimates of polypectomy rate </plain></SENT>
