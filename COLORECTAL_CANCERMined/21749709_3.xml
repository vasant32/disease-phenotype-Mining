<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Decreased expression of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) is associated with an increased risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine whether polymorphisms present in the ADIPOQ and its type 1 receptor (ADIPOR1) could affect the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured five polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ and two polymorphisms in ADIPOR1, and analyzed their associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in 420 CRC patients and 555 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risks (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval) associated with the ADIPOR1 genotypes were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.35-0.81) for rs12733285C/T, 0.59 (95% CI, 0.45-0.78) for rs1342387A/G, and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.39-0.89) for rs1342387A/A, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the risks were more significant in carriers of the allele A of rs1342387A/G (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.46-0.77) than noncarriers (G/G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a further subgroup analysis, we observed that rs266729G/C was associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.05-2.14) but not for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.63-1.22), and that carriers of the G allele had an increased risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (adjusted OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03-2.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the rs12733285C/T genotype and the carriage of the A allele of rs1342387 (A/G or A/A) in ADIPOR1 are the protective factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, while that rs266729G/C and G allele of ADIPOQ are the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> after excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
