<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> prevent the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced cold <z:mp ids='MP_0005407'>hyperalgesia</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> prevents the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">Calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> had been taken by 26 of 69 male patients, but only three of 47 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present analysis, the male data of the groups with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> (n=26 and 43, respectively) were compared </plain></SENT>
