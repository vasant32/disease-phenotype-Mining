<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Shotgun proteomics data analysis usually relies on database search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, commonly used protein sequence databases do not contain information on protein variants and thus prevent variant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and proteins from been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Including known coding variations into protein sequence databases could help alleviate this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on our recently published human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Proteome Variation Database, we have created a protein sequence database that comprehensively annotates thousands of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related coding variants collected in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Proteome Variation Database as well as noncancer-specific ones from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this database, we then developed a data analysis workflow for variant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> identification in shotgun proteomics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high risk of false positive variant identifications was addressed by a modified false discovery rate estimation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines SW480, RKO, and HCT-116 revealed a total of 81 peptides that contain either noncancer-specific or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three out of 26 variants randomly selected from the 81 were confirmed by genomic sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further applied the workflow on data sets from three individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 204 distinct variant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were detected, and five carried known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each individual showed a specific pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related mutations, suggesting potential use of this type of information for personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compatibility of the workflow has been tested with four popular database search engines including Sequest, Mascot, X!Tandem, and MyriMatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have developed a workflow that effectively uses existing genomic data to enable variant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> detection in proteomics </plain></SENT>
