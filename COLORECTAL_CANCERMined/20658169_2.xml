<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Liposomal formulations of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (Lipoplatin™ and Lipoxal™, respectively) were recently proposed to reduce systemic toxicity, while optimizing the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> effectiveness of these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the anti-neoplastic or radio-sensitizing activity of these drugs is attributed to their binding to DNA, we assessed the impact of the liposomal formulations on the time course of accumulation of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33749">platinum compounds</z:chebi> in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> HCT116 cell lines and their distribution between cytoplasm and DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their cytotoxicity was determined by colony formation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> bound to DNA was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although, as a chemotherapeutic agent, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> was as efficient as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> after exposure for a short time, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and Lipoxal™ became more active than <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> against HCT116 cells after 24 h incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lipoxal™ displayed a higher accumulation in the cytoplasm of HCT116 cells compared to free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, consistent with its proposed mechanism of fusion with the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution cytoplasm/DNA of free <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and Lipoplatin™ were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Lipoxal™ had a significantly different cytoplasm/DNA distribution from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>: more than 95% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> transported by the liposome was trapped in the cytoplasm, even after 48 h incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that Lipoxal™ can largely improve the cellular uptake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, but this was not followed by a similar increase in the DNA bound fraction </plain></SENT>
