<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although, in Western countries, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based regimens have been established as a gold standard treatment for patients with stage III or high risk stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> after curative resection, in Japan fluorouracil-based regimens have been widely accepted and recommended in the guidelines for adjuvant settings in patients with stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S-1, an oral preparation evolved from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> and tegafur, has equivalent efficacy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> and tegafur/leucovorin for treating patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and might be a suitable regimen in an adjuvant setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the completion rate of the standard six-week cycle of the S-1 regimen is poor and the establishment of an optimal treatment schedule is critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we will conduct a multicenter randomized phase II trial to compare six-week and three-week cycles to establish the optimal schedule of S-1 adjuvant therapy for patients with stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> after curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The study is an open-label, multicenter randomized phase II trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of this study is three-year disease-free survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints are the completion rate of the treatment, relative dose intensity, overall survival, disease-free survival, and incidence of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sample size was 200, determined with a significance level of 0.20, power of 0.80, and non-inferiority margin of a 10% absolute difference in the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Although S-1 has not been approved yet as a standard treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in an adjuvant setting, it is a promising option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in Japan S-1 is a standard treatment for patients with stage II/III <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> after curative resection and a promising option for patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in an adjuvant setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a six-week cycle of treatment is not considered to be the best schedule, and some clinicians use a modified schedule, such as a three-week cycle to keep a sufficient dose intensity with few adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it will be useful to determine whether a three-week cycle has an equal or greater efficacy and tolerance to side-effects compared with the standard six-week cycle schedule, and thus may be the most suitable treatment schedule for S-1 treatment </plain></SENT>
