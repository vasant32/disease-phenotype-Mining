<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Royal College of Pathologists guidelines state a "minimum" recommended mean number of 12 lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study of 391 patients, the authors aim to determine the optimal node counts in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, examine for correlations between maximum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter and lymph node yield, and examine for correlations between lymph node yield and involved node numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the authors aim to examine the impact of specimen type on the harvested node numbers and assess whether the personal differences between surgeons and pathologists have significant influence on node yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A moderate positive correlation between maximum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter and final lymph node yield was noted (Spearman's correlation coefficient = .328, P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was significant variation shown by pathologists (Kruskal-Wallis test P = .001) and by differing specimen type (Kruskal-Wallis test P = .029) on the lymph node yield </plain></SENT>
