<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of medicated serum prepared with Chinese herbal medicine Zhizhen Recipe (ZZR) on activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and expression and function of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp) in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> multidrug-resistant cell line HCT-8/VCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The multidrug resistance of HCT-8/VCR cells was detected by cell counting kit-8 method, and the experimental concentrations of ZZR-medicated serum were determined by the same way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HCT-8 and HCT-8/VCR cells were treated with ZZR-medicated serum of medium dose for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of NF-κB was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intracellular distribution of P-gp was detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy, and the mean fluorescence intensity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> was detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ZZR-medicated sera with volume fraction of 8%, 16% and 32% of medium dose were confirmed as the experimental sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the untreated group, NF-��B activities of the ZZR-medicated serum groups (ZZR-medicated serum with volume fraction of 8%, 16% and 32% of medium dose) were obviously down-regulated (P&lt;0.01), which had a negative correlation with the concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After interfering HCT-8/VCR with ZZR-medicated serum of different concentrations for 24 h, P-gp in HCT-8/VCR transmitted gradually from cell membrane to cytoplasm and nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nuclei became pyknotic and cracking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the untreated group, the mean fluorescence intensities of ZZR-medicated serum groups declined with concentration gradients (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The efflux of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> decreased, the wave crest shifted to right, and the intracellular fluorescence intensity strengthened (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ZZR-medicated sera of experimental concentrations down-regulate activity of NF-κB and expression and function of P-gp in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> multidrug-resistant cell line HCT-8/VCR and the effect is related to the concentrations </plain></SENT>
