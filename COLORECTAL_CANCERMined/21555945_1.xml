<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare colonoscopy screening/surveillance rates by level of risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> based on age, personal history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, or family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were aged 30-90 years, were seen within 5 years at Intermountain Healthcare, and had family history in the Utah Population Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy rates were measured for those with/without risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among those aged 60-69 years, 48.4% had colonoscopy in the last 10 years, with rates declining after age 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percentages of those having had a colonoscopy in the last 10 years generally increased by risk level from 38.5% in those with a familial relative risk &lt;1.0 to 47.6% in those with a familial relative risk &gt;3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with those with no family history, the odds ratio for being screened according to guidelines was higher for those with one first-degree relative diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> ≥ 60 years or two affected second-degree relatives (1.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.46-1.61) than those with one affected first-degree relative diagnosed &lt;60 years or ≥2 affected first-degree relatives (1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.14-1.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with colonoscopy guidelines was higher for those with familial risk but did not correspond with the degree of risk </plain></SENT>
