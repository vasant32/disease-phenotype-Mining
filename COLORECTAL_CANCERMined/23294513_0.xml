<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Faced with a life-threatening illness, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, many patients develop stress symptoms, i.e. avoidance behaviour, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0558066" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">intrusive thoughts</z:e> and worry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stress management interventions have proven to be effective; however, they are mostly performed in group settings and it is commonly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients who are studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hereby present the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an individual stress-management intervention with a stepped-care approach in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients (â‰¥ 18 years) with a recent diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicle cancer</z:e> and scheduled for adjuvant/curative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> treatment, will consecutively be included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this prospective longitudinal intervention study with a stepped-care approach, patients will be randomized to control, treatment as usual, or an individual stress-management intervention in two steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first step is a low-intensity stress-management intervention, given to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients randomized to intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who continue to report stress symptoms after the first step will thereafter be given more intensive treatment at the second step of the programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the intervention patients will also be motivated to be physically active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Avoidance and intrusion are the primary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the power analyses, 300 patients are planned to be included in the study and will be followed for two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other outcomes are physical activity level, sleep duration and quality recorded objectively, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, quality of life, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, stress in daily living, and patient satisfaction assessed using valid and standardized psychometric tested questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Utilization of hospital services will be derived from the computerized patient administration systems used by the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated through a cost-utility analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This RCT will provide empirical evidence of whether an individually administered stress-management programme in two steps can decrease stress as well as maintain or enhance patients' physical activity level, quality of life and psychological well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further, this RCT, with a stepped-care approach, will provide knowledge regarding the cost-effectiveness of an individually administered stress-management programme whose aim is to help and support individual patients at the right level of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT 01588262 </plain></SENT>
