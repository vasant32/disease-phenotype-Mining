<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five prospective patients (12 men and 13 women; mean age, 66.9 years) with proven primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> underwent integrated (18)F-FDG PET/perfusion CT to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> metabolism (mean and maximum standardized uptake value [SUV(mean) and SUV(max), respectively]) and vascularization (blood flow [BF], blood volume [BV], permeability surface-area product, and standardized perfusion value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intra- and interobserver agreement for PET, perfusion CT, and combined metabolic-flow parameters were determined by Bland-Altman statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 3.8 Â± 1.6 cm; there were five stage IA/B, six stage IIA/B, eight stage IIIA/B, and six stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra- and interobserver agreement for individual parameters was fair to good, with mean differences between observers of -0.74 for SUV(max), -0.16 for SUV(mean), 9.72 for BF, 0.15 for BV, -0.76 for permeability surface-area product, and 0.09 for standardized perfusion value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> were 0.44-0.99 and 0.38-0.89 for intra- and interobserver agreement, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was variable for combined metabolic-flow parameters but better for metabolic-flow difference than for metabolic-flow ratio: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> were 0.69-0.88 for the metabolic-flow difference and 0.44-0.94 for the metabolic-flow ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined parameters to assess the metabolic-flow relationship are influenced by observer variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intra- and interobserver agreement are better for the metabolic-flow differences than for the ratios, suggesting that metabolic-flow differences may be a more robust parameter for clinical practice </plain></SENT>
