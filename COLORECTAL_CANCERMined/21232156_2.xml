<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous research points to differences between predictors of intention to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and screening behavior, and suggests social ecological factors may influence screening behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the social cognitive and social ecological predictors of intention to screen with predictors of participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: People aged 50 to 74 years recruited from the electoral roll completed a baseline survey (n = 376) and were subsequently invited to complete an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate analyses revealed five predictors of intention to screen and two predictors of participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perceived barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and perceived benefits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were the only predictor of both outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was little support for social ecological factors, but measurement problems may have impacted this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has confirmed that the predictors of intention to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening behaviour, although overlapping, are not the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Research should focus predominantly on those factors shown to predict participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perceptions about the barriers to screening and benefits of screening are key predictors of participation, and provide a focus for intervention programs </plain></SENT>
