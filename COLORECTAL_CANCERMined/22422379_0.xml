<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare a 2 day bowel preparation regime of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> and a mild stimulant <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> with a 1 day <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-only regime for CT colonography (CTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 100 consecutive patients underwent CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first 50 patients (Regime 1) ingested 1 bisacodyl tablet twice a day 3 days before CTC and 1 dose each of 50 ml of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> and 20 ml of iodinated contrast per day starting 2 days before CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second 50 patients (Regime 2) ingested 3 doses of iodinated contrast over 24 h prior to CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volumes of residual stool and fluid, and the effectiveness of stool and fluid tagging, were graded according to methods established by Taylor et al (Taylor S, Slaker A, Burling D, Tam E, Greenhalgh R, Gartner L, et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT colonography: optimisation, diagnostic performance and patient acceptability of reduced-<z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi> regimens using <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi>-based faecal tagging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eur Radiol 2008; 18: 32-42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 3 day low-residue diet was taken by both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires rating the side-effects and burden of the bowel preparation were compared to a control cohort of patients undergoing <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of colons producing none/scattered stool (score 1) was 90.3% with Regime 1 and 65.0% with Regime 2 (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Any residual stool was significantly better tagged with Regime 1 (score 5), with 91.7% of Regime 1 exhibiting optimum tagging vs 71.3% of Regime 2 (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in side-effects between the bowel preparation regimes for CTC were elicited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bowel preparation for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema was tolerated significantly worse than both of the CTC bowel preparation regimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regime 1, containing a 3 day preparation of a mild <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50503">laxative</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>, produced a significantly better prepared colon, with no difference in patient acceptability </plain></SENT>
