<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 29 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our modified Saltz regimen was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was overall response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, 11 had previous chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A partial response occurred in 11 patients, stable disease in 16 patients, and progressive disease in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease control rate was 93.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rates with and without previous treatment were 18.2% and 50%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 17.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main hematologic toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (22.6%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (45.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our modified Saltz regimen exhibited sufficient efficacy, feasibility, and manageable toxicity as a therapeutic option for selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
