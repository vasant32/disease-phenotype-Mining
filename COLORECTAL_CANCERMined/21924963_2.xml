<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased DNA damage contributes to genetic instability and promote the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the repair of oxidatively induced DNA base damage may be modulated in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>, resulting in lower levels of DNA base lesions than in surrounding pathologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we investigated oxidatively induced DNA damage in cancerous tissues and their surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of oxidatively induced DNA lesions such as 4,6-diamino-5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35877,38339">formamidopyrimidine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29145">2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52617">8-hydroxyguanine</z:chebi> and (5'S)-8,5'-cyclo-2'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16335">deoxyadenosine</z:chebi> were measured by gas chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the levels of these DNA lesions were significantly lower in cancerous colorectal tissues than those in surrounding non-cancerous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the level of DNA lesions varied between colon and rectum tissues, being lower in the former than in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results strongly suggest upregulation of DNA repair in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346629" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant colorectal tumors</z:e> that may contribute to the resistance to therapeutic agents affecting the disease outcome and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The type of DNA base lesions identified in this work suggests the upregulation of both base excision and nucleotide excision pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Development of DNA repair inhibitors targeting both repair pathways may be considered for selective killing of <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
