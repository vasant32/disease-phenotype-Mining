<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Inconsistent results regarding the association between abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA), the precursor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To provide a quantitative assessment of this relationship, we summarized the evidence from observational studies in categorical, linear dose-response meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies of waist circumference (WC) and/or waist-hip ratio (WHR) and CRA risk published until the end of October 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary relative risks (SRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was assessed using the Cochran's Q and I statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 21 studies (four case-control studies, 12 cross-sectional studies, and five cohort studies) were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the SRRs of CRA were 1.39 (95% CI: 1.24-1.56) for the highest versus the lowest level of WC and 1.22 (95% CI: 1.10-1.35) for WHR (P-value for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> 0.013 and 0.458, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In linear dose-response analysis, a 10-cm increase in WC was related to an increased risk of CRA (SRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13-1.26) and a 0.1-unit increment in WHR gave 1.16 (95% CI: 1.06-1.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses revealed that the increased risk of CRA in abdominally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals was independent of geographic location, design, sex, and confounders: alcohol use, smoking status, and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, BMI may be a confounder for the association between WC and CRA risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that abdominally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, both men and women, may have an increased risk of CRA </plain></SENT>
