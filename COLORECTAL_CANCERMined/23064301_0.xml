<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Two hundred patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (ratio F/M of 2:1) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided in subgroups according to N-stage and LNR score, subgroups of LNR were made on quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each subgroup 5 year survival rate was calculated and comparison between groups was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 104 patients on N0, 38 on N1 and 58 on N2 stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival rate at 5 years was 61.30% for the NO subgroup, 18.70% for the N1 subgroup, and 12.31% for the N2 subgroup (Fig. 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant p value, was reported between N0 and N1 as well as between N0 and N2 subgroup (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nodes positive were 44 a LNR ranging from 1% to 25% (1% &lt; LNR &lt; 25%); 24 patients from 26% to 50% (26% &lt; LNR &lt; 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients LNR was ranging from 51% to 75% (51% &lt; LNR 75%) and in 8 patients from 76% to 100% (76% &lt; LNR 100%); overall survival rate in different quartiles was respectively 27.12%, 9.38%, 16.67% and 1.56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LNR is a reliable prognostic index in post surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> staging </plain></SENT>
