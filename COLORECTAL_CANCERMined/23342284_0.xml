<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study design comprised a cross-sectional study in the United States 1998-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 1998 to 2005 were the method and data source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was self-report up-to-date <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (fecal occult blood test in last 12 months, flexible sigmoidoscopy in last 5 years, or colonoscopy in last 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Geographic location (urban vs. rural) was used as independent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis controlled for demographic and health characteristics of respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for demographic and health characteristics, rural residents had lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates (48%; 95% CI 48, 49%) as compared with urban residents (54%, 95% CI 53, 55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Remote rural residents had the lowest screening rates overall (45%, 95% CI 43, 46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From 1998 to 2005, rates of screening by colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy increased in both urban and rural populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the same time, rates of screening by fecal occult blood test decreased in urban populations and increased in rural populations </plain></SENT>
