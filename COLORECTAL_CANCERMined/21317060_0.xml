<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost of pretherapeutic staging and identify cost determinants for 132 patients presenting colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and living in the north-east of France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Staging cost was estimated using direct medical costs from the point of view of the French Health Insurance System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Independent factors were identified using a linear regression model, and bootstrap resampling was used to estimate unbiased standard errors and 95% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall mean cost for pretherapeutic staging was estimated to be 1534€ [95% CI: 1250€-1818€] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staging costs increased significantly with the number of medical procedures performed during the staging, and according to health care patterns (in-patient hospital stay versus out-patient episodes, public versus private care) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results could now be used to estimate the impact of new imaging techniques on clinical practices and pretherapeutic staging costs </plain></SENT>
