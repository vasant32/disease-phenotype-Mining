<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Deprivation is associated with poorer survival after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but determinants of this socioeconomic inequality are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 4,296 patients undergoing surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 16 hospitals in the West of Scotland between 2001 and 2004 were identified from a prospectively maintained regional audit database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality (&lt;30 days) and 5-year relative survival by socioeconomic circumstances, measured by the area-based Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2006, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in age, gender, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics between socioeconomic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the most affluent group, patients from the most deprived group were more likely to present as an emergency (23.5 vs 19.5 %; p = .033), undergo palliative surgery (20.0 vs 14.5 %; p &lt; .001), have higher levels of comorbidity (p = .03), have &lt;12 lymph nodes examined (56.7 vs 53.1 %; p = .016) but were more likely to receive surgery under the care of a specialist surgeon (76.3 vs 72.0 %; p = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, deprivation was independently associated with increased postoperative mortality [adjusted odds ratio 2.26 (95 % CI, 1.45-3.53; p &lt; .001)], and poorer 5-year relative survival [adjusted relative excess risk (RER) 1.25 (95 % CI, 1.03-1.51; p = .024)] but not after exclusion of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> [adjusted RER 1.08 (95 %, CI .87-1.34; p = .472)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed socioeconomic gradient in long-term survival after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was due to higher early postoperative mortality among more deprived groups </plain></SENT>
