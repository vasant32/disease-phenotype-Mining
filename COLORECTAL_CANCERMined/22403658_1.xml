<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: N-Acetyltransferase (NAT) 2 is an important enzyme involved in the metabolism of different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi>, including potential carcinogens, whose phenotypes were reported to be related to individual susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the results remain conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the relationship between NAT2 phenotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, we performed this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case-control or cohort studies of NAT2 acetylator status on the susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by searching of PubMed and EMBASE, up to May 20, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of over 40,000 subjects from 40 published literatures were identified by searching the databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significantly elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in individuals with NAT2 slow acetylators compared with fast acetylators was found when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies pooled (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.87-1.04, I(2) = 52.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While three studies contributed to the source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> were removed, there was still null result observed (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.90-1.03, P = 0.17 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, I(2) = 17.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we failed to detect any associations in the stratified analyses by race, sex, source of controls, smoking status, genotyping methods or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No publication bias was observed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the NAT2 phenotypes may not be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
