<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR was used to analyze AGR2 and LGR5 in 54 stages I-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and 19 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were significantly increased in PB from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves were 0.722 (p = 0.006), 0.376 (p = 0.123) and 0.767 (p = 0.001) for AGR2, LGR5 and combined AGR2/LGR5, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AGR2/LGR5 assay resulted in 67.4% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AGR2 correlated with pT3-pT4 and high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LGR5 correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, R2 resections and high-grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with high AGR2 was reduced (p = 0.037; HR, 2.32), also in the stage I-III subgroup (p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LGR5 indicated a poor prognosis regarding both PFS (p = 0.007; HR, 1.013) and overall survival (p = 0.045; HR, 1.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High AGR2/LGR5 was associated with poor PFS (p = 0.014; HR, 2.8) by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that the assessment of AGR2 and LGR5 in PB might reflect the presence of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (CTC) and stem cell like CTC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased AGR2 and LGR5 are associated with poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
