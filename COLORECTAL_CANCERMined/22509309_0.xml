<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (APC) is mutated in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases, leading to the synthesis of truncated APC products and the stabilization of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Truncated APC is almost always retained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, suggesting that it serves an essential function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference has been used to down-regulate truncated APC in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines expressing truncated APCs of different lengths, thereby performing an analysis covering most of the mutation cluster region (MCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The consequences on proliferation in vitro, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> formation in vivo and the level and transcriptional activity of β-catenin have been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of truncated APC results in an inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell population expansion in vitro in 6 cell lines out of 6 and inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> outgrowth in vivo as analysed in one of these cell lines, HT29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This provides a general rule explaining the retention of truncated APC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e> and defines it as a suitable target for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actually, we also show that it is possible to design a shRNA that targets a specific truncated isoform of APC without altering the expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of truncated APC is accompanied by an up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in 5 out of 6 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the increased signalling is associated in most cases (4 out of 5) with an up-regulation of β-catenin levels, indicating that truncated APC can still modulate wnt signalling through controlling the level of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This control can happen even when truncated APC lacks the β-catenin inhibiting domain (CiD) involved in targeting β-catenin for proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, truncated APC is an essential component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, required for cell proliferation, possibly by adjusting β-catenin signalling to the "just right" level </plain></SENT>
