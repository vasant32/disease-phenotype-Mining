<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, genetic alteration of PML is rarely observed in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; the exact mechanisms that mediate loss of PML function are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We previously used a comprehensive shotgun mass spectrometry approach to identify PML as 1 of 70 proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with anti-T-cell factor 4 in DLD-1 and HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines; we investigated the effects of altered β-catenin expression on PML function in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: β-catenin specifically interacted with the product of PML transcript variant IV (PML-IV) through the armadillo repeat domain of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of β-catenin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells disrupted the subcellular compartmentalization of PML-IV, whereas knockdown of β-catenin restored formation of PML-NB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modification of PML by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is required for proper assembly of PML-NB. β-catenin inhibited Ran-binding protein 2-mediated SUMOylation of PML-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: β-catenin interacts with PML isoform IV and disrupts PML-IV function and PML-NB formation by inhibiting Ran-binding protein 2-mediated SUMO modification of PML-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the involvement of a posttranslational mechanism in disruption of PML-NB organization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and provide more information about the oncogenic functions of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
