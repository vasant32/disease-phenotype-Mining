<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues of 311 patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> that had undergone potentially curative resections were immunohistochemically assessed using monoclonal antibodies against p53, HIF-1α, and VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positivity rates of p53, HIF-1α, and VEGF were 42.4%, 63.0%, and 56.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HIF-1α expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues was determined to be correlated significantly with the expression of VEGF (p=0.040), and depth of invasion (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HIF-1α was independently associated with poor overall survival (p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HIF-1α expression is associated with VEGF expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the expression of HIF-1α in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and poor overall survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
