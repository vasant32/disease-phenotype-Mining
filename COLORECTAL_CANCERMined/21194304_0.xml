<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a re-laparoscopic approach to manage anastomotic leakage after minimally invasive colorectal resection and to compare its clinical outcomes with those obtained using an open approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from 1714 patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection from September 2006 to August 2009 at the Korea University Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data from a total of 57 surgery patients who developed anastomotic leakage were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six leakage cases were managed laparoscopically, whereas the remaining 31 leakage cases were managed using an open approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in age, sex, or other clinical features between patients in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total operation time was shorter in the laparoscopic group (107.3 ± 68.1 minutes) than in the open group (126.5 ± 50.1 minutes), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = .230) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six cases in each group required additional procedures such as reoperation or percutaneous intervention (P = .126) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one case of postoperative mortality in the open group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median (quartiles 25%-75%) number of days required to resume a soft diet tended to be shorter in the laparoscopic group than the open group (5 [3-7] versus 6 [5-10] days; P = .057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups showed similar postoperative complications including intraabdominal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>; however, the incidence of wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was significantly lower in the laparoscopic group than the open group (3.8% versus 25.8%; P = .031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional open treatment of anastomotic leakage, the laparoscopic approach resulted in fewer wound complications and tendency of early recovery of bowel movement without an increase in adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using a laparoscopic approach, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the advantages of minimally invasive surgery can be realized in patients who develop anastomotic leakage after minimally invasive surgery </plain></SENT>
