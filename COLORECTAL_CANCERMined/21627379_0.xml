<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ecological study was conducted in Korea to determine the association between alcohol consumption and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates for the years 1999?2007 from the Korean Central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and the data on national alcohol consumption for the years 1998, 2001, 2005, and 2007 from the reports of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation coefficients were determined using data for alcohol intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>People who consumed more than 45 g alcohol/day were defined as heavy drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between alcohol consumption and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rate was observed in men; Pearson's correlation coefficients were statistically significant for men (r = 0.99; P = 0.001), but not for women (r = 0.82; P = 0.180) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the &lt;50-year age group, the age-specific incidence rate for men was comparable to that for women, but in the â‰¥ 50-year age group, it increased rapidly in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in alcohol consumption appears to be attributable to increase in the number of heavy drinkers among men aged 25-59 years, particularly among men aged 45-49 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings may aid in predicting future <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence in Korea </plain></SENT>
