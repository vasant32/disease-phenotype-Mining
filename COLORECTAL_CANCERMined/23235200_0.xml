<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Zonulin is a newly discovered protein that has an important role in the regulation of intestinal permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous study showed that probiotics can decrease the rate of infectious complications in patients undergoing colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effects of the perioperative administration of probiotics on serum zonulin concentrations and the subsequent effect on postoperative infectious complications in patients undergoing colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 150 patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were randomly assigned to the control group (n = 75), which received placebo, or the probiotics group (n = 75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the probiotics and placebo were given orally for 6 d preoperatively and 10 d postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were measured by assessing <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> translocation, postoperative intestinal permeability, serum zonulin concentrations, duration of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo>, and cumulative duration of antibiotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postoperative infection</z:e> rate, the positive rate of blood microbial DNA, and the incidence of postoperative infectious complications-including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096243" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">central line infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>-were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate was lower in the probiotics group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Probiotics decreased the serum zonulin concentration (P &lt; 0.001), duration of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo>, duration of antibiotic therapy, and rate of postoperative infectious complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase signaling pathway was inhibited by probiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative probiotic treatment can reduce the rate of postoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> and is associated with reduced serum zonulin concentrations in patients undergoing colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose a clinical regulatory model that might explain this association </plain></SENT>
