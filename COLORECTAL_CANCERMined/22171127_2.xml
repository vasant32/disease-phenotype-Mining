<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: VEGF-A expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and stromal cells from 165 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between VEGF-A expression status and clinicopathological factors was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty fresh-frozen samples were obtained for laser capture microdissection to analyze the splice variants of VEGF-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEGF-A was expressed in 53.9% and 42.4% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and stromal cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF-A expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (t-VEGF-A) was associated with advanced clinical stage (stage 0, 1/9; stage 1, 2/16; stage 2, 32/55; stage 3, 38/66; stage 4, 16/19, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEGF-A expression in stromal cells (s-VEGF-A) increased in the earlier clinical stage (stage 0, 7/9; stage 1, 6/16; stage 2, 33/55; stage 3, 22/66; stage 4, 5/19; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses for risk factors of recurrence showed that only s-VEGF-A expression was an independent risk factor for recurrence (relative risk 0.309, 95% confidence interval 0.141-0.676, P = 0.0033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The five-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of t-VEGF-A-positive and -negative cases were 51.4% and 62.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in t-VEGF-A expression status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The five-year DFS rates of s-VEGF-A-positive and -negative cases were 73.8% and 39.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>s-VEGF-A-positive cases had significantly better survival than s-VEGF-A-negative cases (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Splice variant analysis revealed that t-VEGF-A was mainly composed of VEGF165 and that s-VEGF-A included both VEGF165 and VEGF165b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In cases with no venous invasion (v0), the level of VEGF165b <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly higher (v0 204.5 ± 122.7, v1 32.5 ± 36.7, v2 2.1 ± 1.7, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The microvessel density tended to be lower in cases with higher VEGF165b <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: s-VEGF-A appears be a good prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and includes VEGF165 and VEGF165b </plain></SENT>
