<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in a proportion of patients with a pCR, acellular pools of mucin are present in the surgical specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical implications of acellular mucin pools in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> achieving a pCR after neoadjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> followed by proctectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A single-centre <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> database was searched for patients with clinical Stage II and Stage III <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> who achieved a pCR (i.e. ypT0N0M0) after neoadjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> followed by proctectomy between 1997 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized according to the presence or absence of acellular mucin pools in the resected specimen, and groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and treatment characteristics, and oncological outcomes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were 3-year local and distant recurrences, and disease-free and overall survivals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-eight patients with clinical Stage II or Stage III <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were treated by neoadjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight of these patients had a 58 pCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 58 patients with a pCR had acellular mucin pools in the surgical specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median follow up was 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The groups were statistically similar with respect to demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> regimens, distance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> from the anal verge, clinical stage and surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient had local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with acellular mucin pools had increased distant recurrence (21%vs 5%), decreased disease-free survival (79%vs 95%) and decreased overall survival (83%vs 95%) rates, although none of these differences was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of acellular mucin pools in a proctectomy specimen with a pCR does not affect local recurrence, but may suggest a more aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> biology </plain></SENT>
