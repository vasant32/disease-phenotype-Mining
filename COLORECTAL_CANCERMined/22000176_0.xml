<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Survival with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is variable and difficult to predict </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size is not part of the staging system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and in itself is not a predictor of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize, however, that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size is important in determining disease free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified and divided into 2 categories: those who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> within 5 years after surgery and those who were alive and disease free at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume to percent positive nodes was calculated for each patient (TN ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>35 (55%) were alive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> free at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TN ratio was significantly higher in patients who were disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to number of positive nodes, percent positive nodes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume, the TN ratio was the most significant predictor of disease free survival at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients who survive 5 years after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery have a statistically significantly higher TN ratio than those patients who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> within 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and positive nodes have a lower TN ratio and a statistically decreased 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
