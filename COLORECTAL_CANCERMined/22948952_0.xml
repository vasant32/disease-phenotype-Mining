<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously established safety and immunogenicity of a p53 synthetic long <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (p53-SLP®) vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current trial, we investigated whether combination of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) with p53-SLP® is both safe and able to improve the induced p53-specific IFN-γ response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients successfully treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, nine patients completed follow-up after two injections with p53-SLP® together with IFN-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety and p53-specific immune responses were determined before and after vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cryopreserved PBMCs were compared head-to-head to cryopreserved PBMCs obtained in our previous trial with p53-SLP® only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toxicity of p53-SLP® vaccination in combination with IFN-α was limited to Grade 1 or 2, with predominantly small ongoing swellings at the vaccination site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients harbored p53-specific T cells after vaccination and most patients showed p53-specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the previous trial, addition of IFN-α significantly improved the frequency of p53-specific T cells in IFN-γ ELISPOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in this trial, p53-specific T cells were detectable in blood samples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in a direct ex vivo multiparameter flowcytometric assay, opposed to only 2 of 10 patients vaccinated with p53-SLP® only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, patients in this trial displayed a broader p53-specific immunoglobulin-G response, indicating an overall better p53-specific T-helper response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that p53-SLP® vaccination combined with IFN-α injection is safe and capable of inducing p53-specific immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When compared to a similar trial with p53-SLP® vaccination alone the combination was found to induce significantly more IFN-γ producing p53-specific T cells </plain></SENT>
