<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to find a methylation-related gene that could become a biomarker or therapeutic target in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We screened candidate genes suspected to be silenced by DNA methylation using cDNA microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the clinical significance of one candidate gene (UNC5B), we analyzed the correlation between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and clinicopathological features using clinical tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, methylation specific PCR analysis was performed to reveal whether the promoter region was methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found 75 candidate genes that were potentially suppressed by DNA methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We focused on UNC5B, a possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene and regulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> known to be inactivated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression analysis using tissue samples revealed that UNC5B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was down-expressed in about 20% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and the patients with low-UNC5B-expression <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed a significantly higher recurrence rate after curative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the univariate and multivariate analysis, low UNC5B expression was an independent risk factor for postoperative recurrence in stage I, II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with low expression of UNC5B in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had significantly poorer prognosis than those with high expression of UNC5B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although UNC5B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was restored by the demethylation treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, the promoter region of UNC5B was not methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UNC5B is a potential biomarker for the selection of patients with high risk of postoperative recurrence and worse prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
