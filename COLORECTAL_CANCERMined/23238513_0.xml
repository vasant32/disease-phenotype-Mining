<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The colorectal two-week wait fast track (FT) referral system was nationally implemented in the UK in 2000 to ensure patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) received prompt access to specialized services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the association between the mechanism of referral to colorectal services and the 5-year outcomes for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> presenting between October 2002 and September 2004 were identified retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis for survival and recurrence of disease at 5 years from presentation was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes for patients were compared between fast track (FT), non-fast track (NFT) and emergency referral (ER) routes, using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 189 patients, 96 (51%) presented via the FT, 41 (22.5%) via the NFT and 52 (27.5%) via the ER referral route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival was 52.6% ± 5.1, 41.5% ± 7.7 and 38.5% ± 6.7 for the FT-, NFT- and ER groups respectively (p = 0.075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specific survival was 60.3% ± 5.2, 58.8% ± 5.3 and 43.5% ± 7.2 for the FT-, NFT- and ER groups respectively (p = 0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients referred as emergencies had worse 5-year overall survival; 49.3% ± 4.3 (FT&amp;NFT) vs. 38.5% ± 6.7 (ER) (p = 0.042) and 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specific survival 59.8% ± 4.4 (FT&amp;NFT) vs. 43.5% ± 7.2 (ER) (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 136 patients (FT n = 71, NFT n = 34, ER n = 31) underwent potentially curative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences in 5-year survival did not reach statistical significance in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Referral route to specialist services for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> via the fast track pathway compared to non-fast track pathway was not associated with improved survival </plain></SENT>
