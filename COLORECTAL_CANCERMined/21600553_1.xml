<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was designed to examine the significance of colorectal synchronous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in a large cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinicopathological features of 102 patients with synchronous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were compared with 1,793 patients with solitary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of synchronous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was 3.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients, 4% had FAP, 6% had hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e>, and 2% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The index <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was more likely to have higher histological grade and T stage than other <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>(s) in the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared with solitary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, synchronous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was more often noted in males with coexisting FAP and in proximal location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate of patients with synchronous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was 53% and was similar to those with solitary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We examined the clinicopathological features of patients with synchronous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in a large cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Attention to these features was important for better management of this group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
