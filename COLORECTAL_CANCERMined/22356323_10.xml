<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial involving asymptomatic adults 50 to 69 years of age, we compared one-time colonoscopy in 26,703 subjects with FIT every 2 years in 26,599 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This interim report describes rates of participation, diagnostic findings, and occurrence of major complications at completion of the baseline screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study outcomes were analyzed in both intention-to-screen and as-screened populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of participation was higher in the FIT group than in the colonoscopy group (34.2% vs. 24.6%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> was found in 30 subjects (0.1%) in the colonoscopy group and 33 subjects (0.1%) in the FIT group (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 1.64; P=0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in 514 subjects (1.9%) in the colonoscopy group and 231 subjects (0.9%) in the FIT group (odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.97 to 2.69; P&lt;0.001), and nonadvanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in 1109 subjects (4.2%) in the colonoscopy group and 119 subjects (0.4%) in the FIT group (odds ratio, 9.80; 95% CI, 8.10 to 11.85; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in the FIT group were more likely to participate in screening than were those in the colonoscopy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the baseline screening examination, the numbers of subjects in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was detected were similar in the two study groups, but more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were identified in the colonoscopy group </plain></SENT>
