<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a diagnostic biopsy was adequately representative of the main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty cases of paired biopsy and subsequent resection specimens were randomly selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were screened for mutation in KRAS (codons 12/13, 61, and 146), BRAF (codon 600 and exon 11), PIK3CA (exons 1, 9, and 20), TP53 (exons 5-8), and microsatellite instability, using the quick multiplex consensus or standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols followed by high-resolution melting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 570 paired PCR tests were performed for mutation detection, and identical results were obtained in both biopsy and resection specimens in 569 tests (&gt;99% concordance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases (13%) showed microsatellite instability, and, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases, instability was seen at identical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> markers in both biopsy and matched resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that diagnostic biopsy specimens, even though they are a tiny sample of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, are sufficiently representative for use in predictive testing for early driver mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
