<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reviews the management and outcomes of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCPs</z:chebi> across a UK region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with a malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> were identified using the NORCCAG (NORthern <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Audit Group) database between April 2006 and July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> histopathology reports and follow-up procedures were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 386 patients identified, 165 (42.7%) had the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> biopsied and 221 (57.3%) had an endoscopic local excision (37 piecemeal excision, 184 polypectomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients having an endoscopic biopsy underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>103 (46.6%) having a local excision had follow-up surgery, of whom 79 (76.7%) had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 118 patients managed endoscopically, none had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual cancer</z:e> on follow-up endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 21 (5.4%) Dukes C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were associated with Kikuchi SM3/Haggitt 4 lesions (χ(2) =10.85, P=0.005) and lesions with an involved/unsure excision margin (χ(2) =7.44, P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Predictors of finding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumour</z:e> at surgery after local excision were Kikuchi SM3/Haggitt Level 4 (χ(2) =17.07, P&lt;0.001) and an involved/unsure excision margin (χ(2) =20.45, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An excision margin &gt;0 mm was associated with the finding of no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumour</z:e> (χ(2) =25.21, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in survival between surgical and endoscopic management (χ(2) =0.634, P=0.426) after a mean follow-up of 25.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopic management of a subgroup of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCPs</z:chebi> appears safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A clear resection margin (&gt;0 mm) appears sufficient to avoid surgery, except in locally advanced lesions (Kikuchi 3/Haggitt 4) which have a greater risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual cancer</z:e> at surgery and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
