<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been confirmed in several clinical trials as an important therapeutic target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, given that the efficacy of antiangiogenic agents appears to be limited to a subset of patients, the identification of who will obtain the greater benefit from this therapy or suffer from specific toxicities and when or for how long they should be administered in the treatment algorithm are major open questions for clinicians and challenges for present and future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current evidence indicates some predictive value for particular circulating measures, such as an increase in VEGF, a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) or circulating endothelial cells, tissue biomarkers, microvessel density, KRAS and BRAF gene mutations or polymorphisms affecting components of the VEGF pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many questions relating to these and other surrogate biomarkers, however, remain unanswered and their clinical usefulness has yet to be proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on the present status of knowledge and future perspectives for developing molecular tools to foresee and monitor antiangiogenic therapy activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
