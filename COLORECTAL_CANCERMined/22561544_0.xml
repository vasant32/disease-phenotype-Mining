<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro biological evaluation of these <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> complexes revealed that their antitumor activity had a close relationship with the shape of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22323">alkyl groups</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo antitumor study indicated that complex 1c, [(1R,2R)-N(1)-(2-butyl)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine-N,N'] (oxalato-O,O')<z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> (II), possessed rather high antitumor effect and low toxicity compared with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antitumor mechanism of 1c has been tentatively studied, which might be different from that of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
