<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Primary aim of our study was to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of automated carbon dioxide (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>) delivery as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> distending agent in 3.0T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> colonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rectally insufflated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> was evaluated in four groups with different bowel preparation (A-D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bowel preparation regimes were: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-based tagging (A), bowel purgation (B), <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi>-based tagging (C) and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-based tagging (D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supine (3D)T1w-FFE and (2D)T2w-SSFSE series were acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each colon was divided into six segments (cecum S1-rectum S6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two observers independently assessed the presence of artefacts, diagnostic confidence and segmental colonic distension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also characteristics of the residual stool (presence, composition and signal-intensity) were assessed per segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discomfort was assessed with questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen healthy subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonic distension by means of rectally insufflated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> was not associated with susceptibility artefacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall image quality was affected by the presence of bowel motion-related artefacts: none of the segments in 3DT1w-series and 10/84 (12%) colon segments in 2DT2w-series were rated artefact-free by both observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic confidence ratings were superior for the 2DT2w-SSFSE series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall bowel distension was rated adequate to optimal in 312/336 (93%) colon segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> colonography at 3.0T using carbon dioxide (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>) for colonic distension is technically feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of intraluminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> did not result in susceptibility artefacts, although overall image quality was influenced by artefacts </plain></SENT>
