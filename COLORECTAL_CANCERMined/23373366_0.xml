<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first surgical treatments began with Faget, who did the first rectal extraperitoneal excision (1739) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the middle of 20th century, Dixon defined the resective interventions and in Litre did a colostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is point out the necessity of early diagnosis and protocolar chirurgical end oncological approach to the treatment of this malignant disease which must be done before choosing any operative procedure in order to prevent postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
