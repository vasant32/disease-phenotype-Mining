<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) is a major regulator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and variation in NFκB-associated genes could potentially be used as biomarkers to identify patients with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) development, and/or a rapidly progressing disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 348 CRC cases and 806 randomly selected healthy individuals from southeastern Sweden were examined with regard to seven polymorphisms in NFκB pathway-associated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Log-rank-tests and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis examined the association between the polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific survival, whereas chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were used to test for associations between the polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous and polymorphic TNFAIP3 (rs6920220), heterozygous NLRP3 (Q705K) and polymorphic NFκB -94 ATTG ins/del genotypes were found to be associated with poorer survival in patients diagnosed with invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (aHR = 5.2, 95% CI: 2.5-10.9, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
