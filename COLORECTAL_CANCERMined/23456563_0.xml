<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods This phase I study evaluated the feasibility of combining oral pazopanib, an agent that targets multiple proangiogenic factors, with FOLFOX6 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, leucovorin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>) or CapeOx (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phase I study evaluated the optimally tolerated regimen of daily pazopanib (dose-escalated) plus standard FOLFOX6 or CapeOx in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the optimally tolerated regimen, each cohort was expanded to further evaluate safety and clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results The optimally tolerated regimens were pazopanib 800 mg plus FOLFOX6 and pazopanib 800 mg plus reduced CapeOx (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 850 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most commonly reported adverse events in the FOLFOX6 cohorts included decreased appetite, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the most commonly reported adverse events in the CapeOx cohorts included <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and decreased appetite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 40 % (8/20 patients) in the pazopanib plus FOLFOX6 cohorts and 38 % (8/21 patients) in the pazopanib plus CapeOx cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion Pazopanib combined with FOLFOX6 or reduced CapeOx was adequately tolerated in this patient population </plain></SENT>
