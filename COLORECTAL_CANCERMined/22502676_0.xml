<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) is well established in Western populations, but is hampered by poor patient compliance due to the imposed dietary restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) do not require dietary restriction, but are more expensive than gFOBT and therefore restrict its use in developing countries in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, Asian diets being low in meat content may not require diet restriction for gFOBT to achieve equivalent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the validity and suitability of gFOBT and FIT or a combination of the two in screening for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> without prior dietary restriction in an Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients referred to the Endoscopic Unit for colonoscopy were recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stool samples were collected prior to bowel preparation, and tested for occult blood with both gFOBT and FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dietary restriction was not imposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To assess the validity of either tests or in combination to detect a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the colon, their false positive rates, their sensitivity (true positive rate) and the specificity (true negative rate) were analyzed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and three patients were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for picking up any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was 53% for FIT, 40% for gFOBT and 23.3% for the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivities for picking up only <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were 77.8% , 66.7% and 55.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The specificity for excluding any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was 91.7% for FIT, 74% for gFOBT and 94.5% for a combination, whereas for excluding only <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> they were 84%, 73.4% and 93.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 69 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopic findings, FOBT was positive in 4.3%, 23.2 %and 2.9% for FIT, gFOBT, or combination of tests respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FIT is the recommended method if we are to dispense with dietary restriction in our patients because of its relatively low-false positivity and better sensitivity and specificity rates </plain></SENT>
