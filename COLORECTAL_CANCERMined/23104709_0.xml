<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> (LM) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is increasingly performed with a curative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is currently not possible to identify those <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who may benefit the most from this surgical strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of risk factors for survival after lung metastasectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of series published between 2000 and 2011, which focused on surgical management of LM from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and included more than 40 patients each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pooled hazard ratios (HR) were calculated by using random effects model for parameters considered as potential prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five studies including a total of 2925 patients were considered in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four parameters were associated with poor survival: (1) a short disease-free interval between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection and development of LM (HR 1.59, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.27-1.98); (2) multiple LM (HR 2.04, 95 % CI 1.72-2.41); (3) positive hilar and/or mediastinal lymph nodes (HR 1.65, 95 % CI 1.35-2.02); and (4) elevated prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen (HR 1.91, 95 % CI 1.57-2.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By comparison, a history of resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (HR 1.22, 95 % CI 0.91-1.64) did not achieve statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical variables associated with prolonged survival after surgery for LM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients include prolonged disease-free interval between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and metastatic spread, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen, absence of thoracic node involvement, and a single pulmonary lesion </plain></SENT>
