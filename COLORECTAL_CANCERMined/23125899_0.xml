<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2002 until March 2010, patients that presented to our institution with the initial diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and were submitted to an open curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> resection or a palliative procedure were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were the use of antithrombotic medication, i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23403">coumarins</z:chebi>, and appendiceal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data acquired from medical files included age, gender, past medical history, antithrombotic treatment received prior to endoscopic diagnosis, preoperative imaging staging, location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, surgical and final histopathological report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients that did not receive any antithrombotic medication prior to the endoscopic diagnosis comprised the control group of the study, while patients that were on antiplatelet medication comprised the antiplatelet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was a comparison of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stage in the two groups of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> presenting symptoms and the incidence of each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage in the two groups were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 387 patients with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were submitted to our department for further surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight patients (25.32%), with a median age of 71 years (range 52-91 years), were included in the antiplatelet group, while 289 (74.67%) patients, with a median age of 67 years (range 41-90 years), were not in any <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prophylaxis medication (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients were treated with some kind of palliative procedure, either endoscopic, such as endoscopic stent placement, or surgical, such as de-compressive colostomy or deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary disease</z:hpo> (77.55% - 76 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence prevention (14.28% - 14 patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (8.16% - 8 patients) were the indications for the administration of antiplatelet treatment (aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>) in the antiplatelet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients on aspirin treatment received a dosage of 100 mg/d, while the minimum prophylactic dosages were also used for the rest of the antiplatelet drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Investigation of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (147 patients), per rectum blood loss (84 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (81 patients), bowel habits alterations (32 patients), non-specific symptoms, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, (22 patients) or population screening (21 patients) were the indications for the endoscopic investigation in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp>, either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> presenting as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> was significantly higher (P = 0.002) for the antiplatelet arm of the study (71 patients - 72.4% of the antiplatelet group vs 160 patients - 55.3% of the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, node and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> stage was 2.57 ± 0.96 for the control group, 2.27 ± 0.93 for the antiplatelet group (P = 0.007) and 2.19 ± 0.92 for the subgroup of patients taking aspirin (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The incidence of advanced disease (stage IV) was lower for the antiplatelet group of the study (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The adverse effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> that is justifiably attached to this drug category seems to have a favorable impact on the staging characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
