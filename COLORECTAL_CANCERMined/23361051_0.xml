<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon or rectum with progression within 6 months of receiving only one prior fluoropyrimidine/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy regimen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received FOLFIRI and were randomised 2:1 to also receive intravenous trebananib 10 mg kg(-1) once weekly (QW) (Arm A) or placebo QW (Arm B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four patients were randomised (Arms A/B, n=95/49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median PFS in Arms A and B was 3.5 and 5.2 months (hazard ratio (HR) 1.23; 95% CI, 0.81-1.86; P=0.33) and median overall survival (OS) was 11.9 and 8.8 months, respectively (HR 0.90; 95% CI; 0.53-1.54; P=0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Objective response rate (ORR) was 14% and 0% in Arms A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence of grade â‰¥3 adverse events was similar between treatment arms (Arm A, 61%; Arm B, 65%) and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (1%/4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (5%/2%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (1%/0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Administration of trebananib plus FOLFIRI did not prolong PFS compared with placebo plus FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicities were manageable and consistent with those known for FOLFIRI and trebananib </plain></SENT>
