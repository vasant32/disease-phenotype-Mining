<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been attributed to the detection of more early stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well known that in addition to stage at presentation there are a variety of other key factors that determine a patient's outcome following a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example there are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-related factors, such the presence of venous invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and also host-related factors, both in terms of demographic profile and an elevated circulating host <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> that have been shown to be predictive of a poorer outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present review summarises both the background behind the current screening programme and the observed and anticipated impact that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening will have on the key determinants of outcome </plain></SENT>
