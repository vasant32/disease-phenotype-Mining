<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the extent to which ethnic differences in risk factors could explain the age-adjusted variation in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, overall and by stage at diagnosis, among 165,711 African Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos, Native Hawaiians and whites participating in the Multiethnic Cohort Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a median follow-up period of 10.7 years, 2,564 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were identified through surveillance, epidemiology and end result <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> registry linkages in Hawaii and California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each ethnic group compared to whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After accounting for known/suspected risk factors, Japanese Americans (men, RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.09-1.48; women, RR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.24-1.78) and African American women (RR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.23-1.79) remained at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> relative to whites; African American and Japanese American women were also at increased risk of advanced disease compared to whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In site-specific analyses, after multivariable adjustment, African Americans (both sexes) and Japanese American women remained at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and Japanese Americans (both sexes) and Native Hawaiian men for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> compared to whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of our study suggest that differences in the distribution of known/suspected risk factors account for only a modest proportion of the ethnic variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk and that other factors, possibly including genetic susceptibility, are important contributors to the observed disparities in incidence </plain></SENT>
