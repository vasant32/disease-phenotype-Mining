<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current surveillance recommendations for detection of EC and OC in LS patients are not effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small studies have shown that prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (P-TH-BSO) are the most effective and least expensive preventive measures in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data regarding histologic findings in prophylactic specimens in these patients are lacking </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slides were evaluated for the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009092'>endometrial hyperplasia</z:mp> (EH), EC, OC, or any other recurrent histologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients were identified, with an age range of 36 to 61 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had a synchronous or prior colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and 2 patients had a history of sebaceous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Focal FIGO grade 1 endometrioid ECs were detected in 2 patients; 1 was 54 years of age (MSH2 mutation; superficially invasive), and the other was 56 years of age (MLH1 mutation; noninvasive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Focal complex <z:mpath ids='MPATH_483'>atypical hyperplasia</z:mpath>, unassociated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, was seen in 3 patients, ages 35 and 45 (MLH1 mutations) and 53 years (MSH2 mutation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient (44 y, with MSH2 mutation) was found to have a mixed endometrioid/clear cell OC and simple EH without atypia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The OC was adherent to the colon but did not show distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our study, P-TH-BSOs performed because of the presence of LS revealed incidental EC and/or EH in 24% of cases and OC in 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ECs were low grade, confined to the endometrium, and seen in patients older than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic hysterectomy allows detection of early lesions in LS; these lesions appear to be small and focal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This small series of prophylactic hysterectomies may provide some clues about LS-associated endometrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
