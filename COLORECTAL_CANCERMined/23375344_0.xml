<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Observational studies on the association between white meat (including fish and poultry) intake and the risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA), the precursor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, have reported mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To provide a quantitative assessment of this association, we summarized the evidence from observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Relevant studies published on or before April 30, 2012 were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary effect size estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was assessed using the Cochran Q and I(2) statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 23 publications from 21 independent studies (16 case-control and 5 cohort studies) were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on high versus low analysis, the summary effect size estimate of CRA was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.84-1.09) for white meat intake, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80-1.19) for fish intake, and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80-1.18) for poultry intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses revealed that the null associations of CRA with intake of white meat (fish/poultry) were independent of geographic locations, study design, type of food frequency questionnaire, number of cases, and adjustments for confounders, such as body mass index, use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, dietary energy intake, smoking, and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intake of white meat (fish/poultry) is not associated with the risk of CRA </plain></SENT>
