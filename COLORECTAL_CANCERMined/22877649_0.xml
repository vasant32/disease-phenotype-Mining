<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: HT29 cells were treated with various concentrations (10-100μM) for 24h, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was performed to examine the effect of celastrol on growth inhibition of HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beta-catenin siRNA was used for transfection of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected through both DNA laddering analysis and Tdt-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technologies were applied to assess the expression level of c-Myc, Bax, and Bcl-2 in HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Treatment of HT29 cells with celastrol resulted in a growth inhibition effect, and the IC(50) value was 56μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Celastrol induced HT29 cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and increased the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> induction effects of celastrol were significantly attenuated by beta-catenin siRNA transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beta-catenin siRNA markedly increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of c-Myc compared with control siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Beta-catenin siRNA significantly inhibited the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in celastrol-treated HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Beta-catenin mediates the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction effects of celastrol in HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
