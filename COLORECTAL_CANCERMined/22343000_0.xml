<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of hMSH3 is associated with elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats and low levels of microsatellite instability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism that down-regulates hMSH3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a significant association between over-expression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 1, a marker for <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and down-regulation of hMSH3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> on the expression of hMSH3 in human cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> p53 (wt-p53) were exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, rapid down-regulation of both hMSH2 and hMSH3 occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when null or mutated p53 (null/mut-p53) cells were exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, only hMSH3 was down-regulated, and at slower rate than wt-p53 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a reporter assay, we found that disruption of the two putative <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> response elements (HREs) located within the promoter region of the hMSH3 abrogated the suppressive effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> on reporter activity regardless of p53 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an EMSA, two different forms of HIF-1α complexes that specifically bind to these HREs were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A larger complex containing HIF-1α predominantly bound to the HREs in hypoxic null/mut-p53 cells whereas a smaller complex predominated in wt-p53 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, HIF-1α knockdown by siRNA significantly inhibited down-regulation of hMSH3 by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in both wt-p53 and mut-p53 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that the binding of HIF-1α complexes to HRE sites is necessary for down-regulation of hMSH3 in both wt-p53 and mut-p53 cells </plain></SENT>
