<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> process, we evaluated associations between PMH therapy and incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in relation to KRAS mutation status in a population-based cohort of older women [Iowa Women's Health Study (IWHS)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The IWHS enrolled 41,836 randomly selected women, ages 55 to 69 years, in 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PMH therapy and other exposure data were recorded at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples from prospectively identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases (n = 507) were analyzed for somatic KRAS mutations (exon 2, codons 12 and 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox regression models were fit to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PMH therapy (ever vs. never) was inversely associated with KRAS mutation-negative (RR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.06; P = 0.14) and KRAS mutation-positive (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.58-1.16; P = 0.27) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, although the observed risk estimates were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When anatomic subsite was additionally considered, the strongest association was found for KRAS mutation-negative, distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> (RR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.96; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we provide the first report of KRAS-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risks associated with PMH therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that PMH therapy may reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk through mechanisms beyond KRAS mutation status but might provide greater benefits for KRAS mutation-negative than mutation-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (at least in the distal colorectum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Findings from this prospective cohort study provide novel insights about the molecular biology of PMH therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk reduction </plain></SENT>
