<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used both time and motion methodology and hospital data to assess the contribution of staff time and facility usage to the overall cost of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care during patient visits to a comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centre in Quebec, using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> as a model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A workflow diagram was created mapping direct and indirect steps involved during a patient's physician or treatment (FOLFOX/bevacizumab or XELOX/bevacizumab) visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Staff were timed as they performed each task and this data together with compensation amounts were used to calculate personnel costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean work times and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs for the Centre were calculated using information from hospital databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> costs were presented in constant Canadian dollars for the 2010-2011 fiscal year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For physician visits, direct and indirect personnel costs were $9.25 (95%CI:$7.00-$11.51) and O&amp;M costs were $60.21, for a total of $69.46 (95%CI:$67.21-$71.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For treatment visits, personnel and O&amp;M costs were $71.91 (95%CI:$45.53-$98.29) and $62.00 respectively for a total of $133.91 (95%CI:$107.53-$160.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When calculated for treatment alone, the total cost was $136.06 (95%CI:$109.16-$162.95) for FOLFOX/bevacizumab and $119.94 (95%CI:$96.89-$142.99) for XELOX/bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest cumulative personnel costs were for the pharmacists and nurses ($38.87 and $34.82 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regarding patient flow, total time in between steps was 77.6 and 49.5 minutes for a physician or treatment visit respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study from a health care provider's perspective, demonstrated that in the context of increasingly expensive therapies, costs associated with staff time and facility usage do not contribute greatly to the overall cost of treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It also illustrated the need for improvements in patient and work flow to reduce wait times in the clinic </plain></SENT>
