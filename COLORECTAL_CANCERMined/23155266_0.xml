<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression has been demonstrated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> but remains incompletely defined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated MMR protein expression in three population-based samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: IHC staining was performed on full-section (FS) or tissue microarray (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) slides for MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 487 cases, 147 and 340 were performed through FS and <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, Loss of Expression (LoE) of at least one MMR protein was observed in 12.7% based on an expression score of â‰¤3 (on a scale of 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, LoE was significantly higher in <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> (17.9%) compared to FS cases (0.7%) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">epithelial ovarian cancers</z:e> have a loss of MMR protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein expression results vary significantly by the tissue sampling methodology utilized, raising concerns about the clinical utility of this test for <z:mp ids='MP_0008000'>ovarian tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
