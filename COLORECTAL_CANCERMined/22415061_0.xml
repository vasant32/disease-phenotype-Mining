<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The specimens were obtained from 80 patients assisted at Hospital SÃ£o Paulo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biopsy and surgical specimen sections were stained by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin and immunohistochemistry and compared by 3 pathologists blinded to the evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The accuracy for the histological types was 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The grade of differentiation presented an accuracy of 70% with Kappa = .48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of protein p53 exhibited an accuracy of 68% with Kappa = .22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The preoperative biopsy of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> presented good accuracy compared with histopathological examination of the surgical specimen, but with weak to moderate effective degree of agreement between the results </plain></SENT>
