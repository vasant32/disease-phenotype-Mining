<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typically, different datasets do not give single consistent network predictions but rather an ensemble of inconsistent networks inferred under the same reverse-engineering method that are only consistent with the specific experimentally measured data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we focus on an alternative approach for combining the information contained within such an ensemble of inconsistent gene networks called meta-analysis, to make more accurate predictions and to estimate the reliability of these predictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We review two existing meta-analysis approaches; the Fisher transformation combined coefficient test (FTCCT) and Fisher's inverse combined probability test (FICPT); and compare their performance with five well-known methods, ARACNe, Context Likelihood or Relatedness network (CLR), Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRNET), Relevance Network (RN) and Bayesian Network (BN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted in-depth numerical ensemble simulations and demonstrated for biological expression data that the meta-analysis approaches consistently outperformed the best gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) methods in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the meta-analysis approaches have a low computational complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the meta-analysis approaches are a powerful tool for integrating different datasets to give more accurate and reliable predictions for biological networks </plain></SENT>
