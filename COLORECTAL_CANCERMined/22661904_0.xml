<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Matched plasma, serum and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples were available from 71 patients with mCRC who had received prior therapy but whose disease progressed following therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were successful in 70/71 plasma-extracted samples (specificity: 97%, sensitivity: 31%) and 67/71 serum- extracted samples (specificity: 100%, sensitivity: 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that KRAS mutations can be detected in cfDNA using a commercially available KRAS PCR kit, confirming cfDNA as a potential alternative source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA in a diagnostic setting if access to archival <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens is limited </plain></SENT>
