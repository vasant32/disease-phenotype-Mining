<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening decreases <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> through early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection and through removal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether a health exhibit consisting of a giant inflatable colon was an effective educational tool to increase community members' knowledge, intention, and social support for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Alaska adults (N = 880) attending community events statewide from March 2011 through March 2012 completed a short survey to assess knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, intention to get screened, and level of social support before and after walking through a giant interactive model of a human colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survey used a combination of open-ended questions and a Likert scale, where 1 was "very unlikely," 2 was "somewhat unlikely," 3 was "neutral," 4 was "somewhat likely," and 5 was "very likely." The model depicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stages from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue to advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and displayed signs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention tips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the McNemar test and paired sample t tests for univariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Respondents significantly improved their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge (P &lt; .05), intention to get screened (mean score increased from 4.3 to 4.5, P &lt; .001), and comfort with talking to others about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (mean level of comfort increased from 3.8 to 3.9, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed no significant differences by sex, age, or race for improvements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening knowledge, intention, or comfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interactive exhibits can improve public knowledge and interest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, which may lead to increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates and decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
