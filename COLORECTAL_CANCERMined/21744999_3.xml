<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibulin-3 gene has been identified as an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the protein expression and promoter methylation status of fibulin-3 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and analyzed its correlation with clinicopathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population enrolled 85 paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, as well as 32 cases of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded samples using manual microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to determine the promoter methylation status and fibulin-3 gene expression was detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that, downregulation or silence of fibulin-3 protein was found in 57.6% (49/85) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues, which was significantly higher than that of adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues (28.2%, 24/85) and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (34.4%, 11/32) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 33 out of 85 (38.8%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens showed hypermethylation in fibulin-3 promoter region, and fibulin-3 methylation was closely correlated with its loss of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, downregulation of fibulin-3 was associated with advanced stage (P=0.008) and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard models indicated that fibulin-3 downregulation was an independent factor related to adverse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found aberrant methylation caused fibulin-3 downregulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and fibulin-3 downregulation was correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and poor survival, which maybe use as a potential prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
