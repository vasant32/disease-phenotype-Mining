<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and follow up data of 24 elderly patients with recurrent colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> who were treated between January 2000 and June 2009 at the Changhai hospital of the Second Military Medical University were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 24 patients there were 14 men and 10 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 76.9 Â± 5.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The local recurrence was found in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients, both distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and local recurrence were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 patients received operation, including radical resection in 15 patients and palliative resection in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had laparotomy only because of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in the abdomen and involvement of the duodenum and common bile duct.The patient received stent placement in the common bile duct and chemotherapy after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complication occurred in 7(29.2%) patients, which included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo>(n=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo>(n=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary infection</z:hpo>(n=1), wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>(n=2), wound dehiscence(n=1), and wound fat liquefaction(n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 6 months in the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 33 months in patients undergoing radical resection, and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate was 71.4%, 28.6%, and 14.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 3 months in patients who underwent palliative resection, and the 1-year survival rate was 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The difference between the two groups was statistically significant(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Outcomes are acceptable after radical resection for elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> if careful preoperative evaluation and perioperative management are performed </plain></SENT>
