<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Appropriate information provision leads to better patient reported outcomes for patients with nonmetastatic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure the perceived level of, and satisfaction with, information received by patients with mCRC as compared with those with nonmetastatic (stage I,II,III) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, associations of information provision with health status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and illness perceptions were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients diagnosed between 2002 and 2007 according to the Eindhoven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (ECR) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response rate was 75% (n=1159, of which 139 had mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants completed questionnaires on information provision (European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Quality of Life Questionnaire-INFO25), health status (Short Form-36), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale [HADS]), and illness perceptions (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire [B-IPQ]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The perceived receipt of information was quite comparable between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with and without mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only perceived receipt of treatment information was higher for patients with mCRC (45 versus 37; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of the patients with mCRC were satisfied with the amount of received information and almost 30% wanted to receive more information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The perceived receipt of more disease information and information about other services was associated with worse health outcomes, whereas satisfaction with the received information was not associated with health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that some improvements can be made in the provision of information to patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adequate assessment of information needs of mCRC patients, as well as appropriate responses to these needs by providing the information in an appropriate way could possibly lead to improvements in patient satisfaction </plain></SENT>
