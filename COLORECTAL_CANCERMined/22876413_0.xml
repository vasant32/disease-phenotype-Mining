<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether health insurance coverage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening varied based on risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Population-wide screening guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> often incorporate risk information, with modified screening recommendations for those at higher risk due to family history or other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a nationwide Internet- and mail-based survey of health insurance plan medical directors, respondents were asked about their organization's policies towards coverage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening for persons at average and higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional questions asked about whether the insurer had a definition of increased risk, and coverage of genetic testing for familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survey invitations were sent to 1158 medical directors; 133 (11%) completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> plans covered screening for average and high-risk persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of screening was earlier and intervals were more frequent for higher risk compared to average risk persons, with most respondents stating coverage was determined by "physician discretion." While 75% had a definition of high risk, only 55% covered genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most insurers offer enhanced coverage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, most commonly following the discretion of the physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether this coverage results in earlier, more frequent, or more complete screening of higher risk persons remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
