<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the adequacy of nodal sampling in resection specimens for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in a Jamaican population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The pathology records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent operation for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) during the five-year period, 2003-2007, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pertinent clinical and pathologic data were obtained and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one patients were identified with M:F ratio of 1.1:1 and a mean age of 66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 119 (63%) left-sided lesions and 70 (37%) right-sided lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stage T3N0 lesions were the most common and accounted for 41.1% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predominant histologic type was <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (99.5%) with the majority being moderately differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean number of nodes sampled in node-negative cases was 13.8 +/- 9.75 nodes for right-sided lesions and 10.64 +/- 7.25 nodes for left-sided lesions (p = 0.05, CI 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adequacy of nodal sampling was acceptable in cases of N0 right-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> but was unsatisfactory in cases of N0 left-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, however in two cases from the right and 10 cases from the left, two or fewer nodes were harvested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This review suggests the need for re-examination of the adequacy of surgical resection and/or nodal sampling technique for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection specimens, given the importance of nodal status in determining the need for adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Less than adequate node sampling should not be accepted by the reporting pathologist or attending surgeon as this has important prognostic implications </plain></SENT>
