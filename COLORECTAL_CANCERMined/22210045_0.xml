<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The phenotypic expression of any given <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> tissue type is the composite of interactions between individual cell types governed principally by inherent, cell-specific molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a combination of laser-capture microdissection, oligonucleotide microarrays, bioinformatic and statistical tools, we analyzed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues in order to spot the significant pathways that were differentially deregulated between the epithelial and stromal compartments and compared these alongside the ones of whole tissue dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The stromal pathway profiles were very similar to the ones of whole tissue, in contrast to the epithelial input, with stroma emerging as the major determinant of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed genes in the epithelial compartment correlated significantly with the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 tumor marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The accurate interpretation of data arising from the analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> tissue structures lends itself to inherent biases of its constitutive components with each component presenting explorable analytical advantages </plain></SENT>
