<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose: Activation of the KRAS oncogene is implicated in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and mutations have been reported in 30-50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation, though less common, is also reported and importantly associated with shorter progression-free interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to determine the KRAS and BRAF mutation statuses of Nigerian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: Mutation analysis was carried out on archival paraffin-embedded blocks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS codons 12, 13 and 61 and BRAF V600E were assessed by pyrosequencing after DNA extraction from 200 cases at the Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>James's University Hospital, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation rates and the spectra were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: Pyrosequencing was successful in 112 of 200 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation in codons 12 and 13 was demonstrated in 23 of 112 cases (21%); none in codon 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation in codon 600 was demonstrated in 4.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: This study shows that 21% of Nigerian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients carry a KRAS mutation; half the rate in Caucasians; and that BRAF mutation also occurs in Nigerian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
