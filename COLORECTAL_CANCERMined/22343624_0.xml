<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-screening tests are available, but it is uncertain which provides the best balance of risks and benefits within a screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated cost-effectiveness of a population-based screening programme in Ireland based on (i) biennial guaiac-based faecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) at ages 55-74, with reflex faecal immunochemical testing (FIT); (ii) biennial FIT at ages 55-74; and (iii) once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSIG) at age 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A state-transition model was used to estimate costs and outcomes for each screening scenario vs no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A third party payer perspective was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> scenarios would be considered highly cost-effective compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER vs no screening euro 589 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained) was found for FSIG, followed by FIT euro 1696) and gFOBT (euro 4428); gFOBT was dominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with FSIG, FIT was associated with greater gains in QALYs and reductions in lifetime <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality, but was more costly, required considerably more colonoscopies and resulted in more complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were robust to variations in parameter estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Population-based screening based on FIT is expected to result in greater health gains than a policy of gFOBT (with reflex FIT) or once-only FSIG, but would require significantly more colonoscopy resources and result in more individuals experiencing adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Weighing these advantages and disadvantages presents a considerable challenge to policy makers </plain></SENT>
