<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: T-cell infiltration in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> is associated with improved patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary data supports a similar association in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM), and we previously identified increased CRLM expression of the immunostimulatory cytokine LIGHT (TNFSF14) to be related to improved patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mechanisms to augment the T-cell response in CRLM may be a promising treatment modality, however, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immune microenvironment and LIGHT expression in CRLM remains to be characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Utilizing a syngeneic and immunocompetent model of CRLM, the immune microenvironment was characterized for lymphocyte phenotype, function, and location utilizing flow cytometry, immunoassays, and immunofluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes were decreased, and CD8+ cells were increased in CRLM compared to control liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When present, greater populations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were found peritumoral than intratumoral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TIL expressed significantly higher levels of CD69 and CD107a, but lower levels of LIGHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytokine expression profiles revealed increased levels of the T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokines IFN gamma, IL-12, IL-1b, and IL-8 in CRLM compared to control liver tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokines between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment of CRLM revealed that although a limited number of activated T-cells infiltrate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and initiate an immune response, the number of LIGHT + T cells infiltrating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Techniques to decrease suppressive influences or augment the cytotoxic T-cell response are needed and may be possible through mechanisms that can increase intratumoral TIL LIGHT expression </plain></SENT>
