<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report presents coverage and performance of organized screening among the general population in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2004-2007, people aged 60-69 years were randomized into biennial screening and control arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The screening test was a guaiac-based FOB test (Hemoccult) with dietary restriction and three test cards for six consecutive samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Test positives were referred for full colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The programme was launched in 2004 and subsequently it expanded over regions and age-cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2007, the programme covered one-third of the target population and 74,592 people had been invited for screening, of them 26,866 for the second round </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Uptakes for the first and second rounds, respectively, were 62% and 68% in men and 77% and 80% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of test positives increased from 2.4% to 2.9% from the first to the second round and the positive predictive value for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> decreased from 7.5% to 4.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By 2007, organized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening covered one-third of the target population in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Implementation of screening measured with response rate was successful and met the criteria for a public health programme, but performance in terms of positive predictive value needs monitoring </plain></SENT>
