<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2000 to 2005 inclusively, a total of 626 patients featuring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> underwent curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were stratified into LNR groups: 1 (0 &lt; LNR ≤ 0.1); 2 (0.1 &lt; LNR ≤ 0.25); 3 (0.25 &lt; LNR ≤ 0.5); and 4 (LNR &gt; 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was closed in April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test were used to evaluate the prognostic value of LNR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Cox regression model was used for multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up period of 42.2 months, 5-year overall survival for groups LNR1, LNR2, LNR3, and LNR4 was 73%, 64%, 44%, and 22%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, the LNR was an independent prognostic factor for survival (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LNR remained statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001), both in patients with colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancer</z:e> regardless of the number of lymph nodes retrieved (≥12 or &lt; 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The survival rate of ratio group LNR1 was better than ratio group LNR4 (P &lt; 0.001) for patients with the same IIIB or IIIC staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LNR is an accurate prognostic method for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We proposed an algorithm to incorporate LNR into current AJCC staging system to form new staging </plain></SENT>
