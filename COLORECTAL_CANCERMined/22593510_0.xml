<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While epigenetic and genetic modifications of DNA have been reported in blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, little is known about modifications of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> on circulating nucleosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sera of 45 cancer patients (21 colorectal, 4 pancreatic, 15 breast, 5 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>), 12 patients with benign gastrointestinal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, and 28 healthy individuals were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">Histone</z:chebi> modifications were detected by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using antibodies for triple <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methylations at sites H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 and subsequent real-time polymerase chain reaction using primers for the centromeric satellites SAT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the amount of circulating nucleosomes, as well as of carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> antigen (CA) 19-9 were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of SAT2 on H3K9me3 (median 0.507 ng/ml) and on H4K20me3 (0.292 ng/ml) were elevated in sera of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> when compared with healthy controls (0.049 and 0.035 ng/ml), but were lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (0.039 and 0.027 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> marks were correlated with each other but did not correlate with CEA or CA 19-9 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 were normalized to nucleosome content in sera, ratios were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as well as in colorectal and breast subtypes when compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Best discrimination was achieved by normalized H4K20me3 reaching areas under the curves (AUC) of 79.1%, 90.4% and 81.2% in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of these three comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SAT2 levels on H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 are up-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Normalization to total nucleosome content enables better discrimination between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and control groups </plain></SENT>
