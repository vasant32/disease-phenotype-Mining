<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The tissue specimens from 331 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were collected and subject to KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFR mutation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were obtained and macrodissection was performed to enrich the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells for DNA extraction when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR-based direct DNA sequencing was used to investigate the codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of KRAS gene, exons 11 and 15 of BRAF gene, exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA gene and exons 18-21 of EGFR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Activating mutations were detected in KRAS (44.1%, 137/311), BRAF (5.8%, 9/156), PIK3CA (2.6%, 4/156) and EGFR (1.3%, 2/156) in the study cohort of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among KRAS gene mutations, 81.0% (111/137) occurred in codon 12, with p.G12D as the most common variant (45.3%, 62/137); 19.0% (26/137) occurred in codon 13, with 38G &gt; A (G13D) as the most common variant (17.5%, 24/137) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The KRAS mutation frequency is the highest among the four genes (KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFT) tested in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of these gene mutations may provide therapeutic information for targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutation analyses of BRAF and PIK3CA in addition to KRAS should be a part of the standard diagnostic algorithm for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
