<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 17 patients receiving emergency surgery for complications of radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data about the patients and outcomes of the treatment alternatives used were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 17 patients, nine had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, six had gynecological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of the urinary system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As an emergency, 12 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> only, one patient had intestinal fistulae and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo>, two patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> and two patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent resection and anastomosis, two patients intestinal by-pass, four patients resection and ostomy and four patients bridectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morbidity (75% for early complications and 100% for late complications) and mortality in the early postoperative period (25%) were higher in the patients undergoing bridectomy than in the patients undergoing other surgical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of early and late complications (71.4% and 66.6%, respectively) was lower in the patients undergoing resection-anastomosis with a higher of quality life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 11 patients survived during a long follow-up period (64.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As the postoperative complication rate, overall and operative mortality of patients treated for radiation enteropaties as emergent surgery are high, specialists following this group of patients may favor removal of the pathologic tissue to avoid complications in the early and late postoperative period </plain></SENT>
