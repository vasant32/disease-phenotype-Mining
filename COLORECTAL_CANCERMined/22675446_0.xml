<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> loci, we conducted a genome-wide linkage scan in 356 white families with no evidence of defective MMR (i.e., no loss of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> expression of MMR proteins, no microsatellite instability (MSI)-high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, or no evidence of linkage to MMR genes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Families were ascertained via the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> Family Registry multi-site NCI-supported consortium (Colon CFR), the City of Hope Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center, and Memorial University of Newfoundland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,612 individuals (average 5.0 per family including 2.2 affected) were genotyped using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism linkage arrays; parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis used MERLIN in a priori-defined family groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five lod scores greater than 3.0 were observed assuming <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The greatest were among families with mean age of diagnosis less than 50 years at 4q21.1 (dominant HLOD = 4.51, α = 0.84, 145.40 cM, rs10518142) and among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> families at 12q24.32 (dominant HLOD = 3.60, α = 0.48, 285.15 cM, rs952093) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among families with four or more affected individuals and among clinic-based families, a common peak was observed at 15q22.31 (101.40 cM, rs1477798; dominant HLOD = 3.07, α = 0.29; dominant HLOD = 3.03, α = 0.32, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of families with only two affected individuals yielded a peak at 8q13.2 (recessive HLOD = 3.02, α = 0.51, 132.52 cM, rs1319036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These previously unreported linkage peaks demonstrate the continued utility of family-based data in complex traits and suggest that new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk alleles remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
