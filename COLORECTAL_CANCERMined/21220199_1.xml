<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> (GMB) metabolism genes were associated with clinical outcome in pre-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: SNPs of hCNT1, hENT1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e>, dCTD and RRM1 genes were evaluated in 95 mCRC patients and detected using TaqMan genotyping assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Association of genotypes with overall response rate (ORR), time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and overall survival (OS) was tested by univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RRM1 -37A&gt;C polymorphism was correlated with GMB IC50 value and with the RRM1 gene expression level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ORR was 38.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and OS were 4 and 14.3 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, patients carrying the RRM1 -37CC genotype or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> A-76 C-containing allele had a significantly higher likelihood of achieving a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RRM1 -37A&gt;C polymorphism remained associated with clinical efficacy (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, showed that the RRM1 A-37C genotype was associated with the levels of RRM1 expression and with GMB IC50 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the down-regulation of RRM1 with a specific siRNA strongly influenced GMB sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RRM1 -37A&gt;C polymorphism may represent a useful biomarker to select mCRC patients most likely to benefit from GMB-based salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
