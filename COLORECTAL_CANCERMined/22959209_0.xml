<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A hypoxic environment exists in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> because in rapidly growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the development of angiogenic vasculature is heterogenous, usually not enough to overcome the necessary oxygen supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an ischemic condition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells develop escape mechanisms to survive and leave the unfavorable environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>That result in the acquisition of increased potential for local invasion and evasion to distant organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the escape mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells from hypoxic stress have not been fully characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line LoVo was cultured in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and the adhesive and migratory properties were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of cell surface and cytoplasmic molecules was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under hypoxic conditions, cells developed epithelial-mesenchymal transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of α2, α5, and β1 integrins were significantly upregulated and, as a consequence, the ability to adhere to and migrate on collagen and fibronectin was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the expression of 67-kDa laminin receptor and the abilities to adhere to and migrate on laminin were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the expression of CXCR4 was significantly increased on cells cultured in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and the chemotactic activity to stromal cell-derived factor 1α was remarkably increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic stress induced active epithelial-mesenchymal transition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, with the typical morphologic and functional changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These morphologic and functional changes of β1 integrins, the 67-kDa laminin receptor, and CXCR4 may be essential for the acquisition of the invasive and metastatic features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
