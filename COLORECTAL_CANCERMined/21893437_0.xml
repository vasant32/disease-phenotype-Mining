<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Retrospective analyses suggested that a pharmacogenetic approach may allow a tailored selection of chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: We conducted a phase II study of pharmacogenetic-selected first-line chemotherapy in elderly patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with the aim to improve efficacy and to reduce toxicity in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 24 patients were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy regimen was prospectively assigned based on TS, DPD, ERCC-1 and UGT1A1 genotyping results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (50%) were treated with modified FOLFIRI, 11 patients (46%) with modified FOLFOX6 and 1 (4%) with De Gramont regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A partial remission was obtained in 4 cases (17%), stable disease in 8 cases (33%) and progressive disease in 12 cases (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was observed in 7 patients (29%) and diarrhoea in 3 cases (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The trial was then interrupted according to study design requiring 13 partial remissions out of the first 24 patients enrolled as the necessary response rate level in order to continue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prospective selection of chemotherapy based on TS, DPD, ERCC-1 and UGT1A1 expression in elderly advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients failed to confirm previous results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A more accurate validation of retrospective findings is warranted before these molecular markers can be used for treatment selection in the clinical practice </plain></SENT>
