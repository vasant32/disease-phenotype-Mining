<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frequent complications and technical difficulties were serious problems at first, but were gradually improved with experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the indications, technical aspects and management of complications of ESD for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2009, we introduce the use of small tip insulation-tipped diathermic (IT) knife </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Features separating it from the IT knife and IT Knife2 are a smaller ceramic tip and small round disk at the root of the tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During submucosal dissection, the small tip IT knife could dissect large pieces of tissue intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This allows us to shorten the procedure time, particularly the submucosal dissection component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 146 ESD for 140 patients were performed between January 2009 and July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>En bloc, and en bloc and R0 resection rates were 92.5% and 83.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median procedural time was 48.5 min for 40.5 mm specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> and delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 2.1% and 1.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We successfully performed ESD for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> with a shortened procedure time while preserving quality and safety </plain></SENT>
