<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recently it has been found that the hormone (or its individual subunits) is also secreted by many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and that in many cases secretion is associated with poor patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the presence of hCG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi>-253) and evaluated the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> effects of anti-hCG antibodies in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-hCG antibodies were reactive with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi>-253, as revealed by confocal immunoflourescence microscopy; both cell surface and intracellular expression were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that antibodies appeared to interact with several moieties, indicating a level of cross-reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-hCG antiserum specifically reduced the viability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and the addition of complement increased in vitro anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice implanted with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi>-253 cells, administration of anti-hCG antiserum caused a significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated animals survived, while mortality was observed in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that anti-hCG antibodies can mediate significant anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity both in vitro and in vivo and lend support to the rationale of anti-hCG immunization in the therapy of gonadotropin- sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
