<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known, however, if the outcome is significantly different for UICC Ia and Ib patients or if patients with reduced risks of recurrences can be identified early after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is of interest, as it would permit a more cost-effective, patient-oriented, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage-oriented follow-up program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study these questions, a prospective follow-up database, including 1375 patients after curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 296 patients with Dukes A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with a median follow-up of 44 months were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perioperative and follow-up mortality rates were 3% and 14%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent disease</z:e> developed in 10% of Dukes A patients after a disease-free interval of 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly more patients suffering from pT2 (UICC Ib) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> than patients with pT1 (UICC Ia) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (13% vs. 4%; p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative CEA levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> were significantly higher than in long-term disease-free patients (5.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.6 ng/ml; p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> was achieved in 38% of the patients with recurrences (4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis showed significantly better survival in patients with Dukes A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than in those at higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages (log rank, &lt;0.0001), and only 39% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Dukes A patients who died during follow-up had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dukes A (UICC Ia and Ib) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was diagnosed in 22% of our patients treated for cure, and long-term survival was 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were significantly fewer cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> after curative resection of UICC Ia (pT1N0M0) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, so we propose a novel, less intensive follow-up regimen for these patients, leading to a more cost-effective, patient-oriented, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage-oriented follow-up program </plain></SENT>
