<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We recently identified a six-gene methylation-based biomarker panel suitable for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the performance of this novel epi-panel with that of previously identified DNA methylation markers in the same clinical tissue sample sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative methylation-specific PCR was used to analyze the promoter region of SEPT9 and VIM in a total of 485 tissue samples, divided into test and validation sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ITGA4, NTRK2, OSMR, and TUBG2 were also included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the performances of the individual biomarkers with that of the novel epi-panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SEPT9 and VIM were methylated in 82 and 67% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (n=169) and in 88 and 54% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (n=104) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 3% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa samples (n=107) were methylated for these genes, confirming that the methylation was highly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Areas under the ROC curve (AUC), distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, were 0.94 for SEPT9 and 0.81 for VIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AUC values for separating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa samples were 0.96 and 0.81 for the same genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the novel epi-panel achieved an AUC of 0.98 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and 0.97 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>).ITGA4, OSMR, NTRK2, and TUBG2 were methylated in 90, 78, 7, and 1% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, and in 76, 77, 3, and 0% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Between 0 and 2% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa samples were methylated for the same genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ITGA4 and OSMR achieved an AUC of 0.96 and 0.92 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa), and 0.93 and 0.92 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed the high performance of some of the previously identified DNA methylation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we showed that a recently reported epi-panel performed better than the individual DNA methylation biomarkers when analyzed in the same tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This observation was also true for VIM and SEPT9, which are included in commercially available noninvasive tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results further underscore the value of combining a manageable number of individual markers into a panel, which in addition to having a higher sensitivity and specificity might provide a more profound robustness to a noninvasive test compared with single markers </plain></SENT>
