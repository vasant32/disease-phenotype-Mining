<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the impact of sarcopenia and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on survival in patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diagnostic imaging from patients who had hepatic resection for CLM in one centre between 2001 and 2009, and who had assessable perioperative computed tomograms, was analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total cross-sectional areas of skeletal muscle and intra-abdominal fat, and their influence on outcome, were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 196 patients included in the study, 38 (19·4 per cent) were classified as having sarcopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year disease-free (15 per cent versus 28·5 per cent in patients without sarcopenia; P = 0·002) and overall (20 per cent versus 49·9 per cent respectively; P &lt; 0·001) survival rates were lower for patients with sarcopenia at a median follow-up of 29 (range 1-97) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sarcopenia was an independent predictor of worse recurrence-free (hazard ratio (HR) 1·88, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·25 to 2·82; P = 0·002) and overall (HR 2·53, 1·60 to 4·01; P &lt; 0·001) survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of recurrence in men (P = 0·032), but not in women (P = 0·712) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia has a negative impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes following resection of CLM </plain></SENT>
