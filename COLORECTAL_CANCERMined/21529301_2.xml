<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who had progressed on therapy with 5-FU, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and irinotecan in the first and second line setting and on the combination of irinotecan and cetuximab in third line setting independent of their KRAS mutation status, were treated with irinotecan and cetuximab combined with bevacizumab in a dosage of 5 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> drugs were administered every second week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From January 2007 to November 2008 27 patients were treated with cetuximab, irinotecan and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The triple-combination was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression free survival (PFS) was 8.3 months and median overall survival (mOS) was 12.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients without KRAS mutation (7%) obtained a partial response and 17 (63%) had stable disease for at least two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A retrospective KRAS mutation analysis revealed that there was a trend toward longer PFS and mOS in patients without KRAS mutations compared to patients with KRAS mutations with a PFS of 8.9 vs. 5.1 months and a mOS of 12.7 vs. 9.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab is safe to add to irinotecan and cetuximab with a toxicity profile that seems to be similar to what would be expected from the agents alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that adding bevacizumab to irinotecan and cetuximab in a fourth line setting may induce a high rate of disease control in heavily pretreated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
