<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has been a rapid increase in screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) over the past several years in North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This could paradoxically lead to worsening outcomes if the system is not adapted to deal with the increased demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, this could create increased wait times for endoscopy and delayed time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis, which could worsen clinical outcomes such as stage at diagnosis and⁄or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No previous Canadian study has evaluated the association between time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present historical cohort study used Manitoba's population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry and Manitoba Health administrative databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of time to diagnosis on patient survival was evaluated using Cox regression analysis with adjustment for stage at diagnosis, grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, age, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbidity index score and year of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between time to diagnosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stage at diagnosis was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis increased significantly from 72 days (95% CI 61 days to 83 days) in 2004 to 105 days (95% CI 64 days to 129 days) in the first three months of 2009 (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between time to diagnosis and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals with the longest time to diagnosis were less likely to have stage III⁄IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at diagnosis (quartile 4 versus quartile 1: OR 0.50 [95% CI 0.33 to 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis is continuing to increase in Manitoba </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the present study did not detect a significant negative clinical effect of increasing time to diagnosis, additional studies are required </plain></SENT>
