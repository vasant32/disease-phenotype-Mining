<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: In central Liverpool, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is 119% of the national average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, screening is offered to those aged 60-70 through the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A theoretical model showing the effect of the introduction of biennial screening in individuals aged 50-59 has been applied to the population of central Liverpool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The impact of screening using faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in individuals aged 50-59 in central Liverpool (n = 47,440; males 23,312) was assessed by a model based on three levels of compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After modelling, the positive FOBT result for increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the positive predictive value for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection was calculated using age-specific positivity rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that between 120 and 162 new diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> per 100,000 population aged 50-59 could be detected by biennial screening, dependent on compliance rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Screening individuals aged 50-59 can identify early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, which may contribute to a reduction in the expected high mortality rate found in this geographical area </plain></SENT>
