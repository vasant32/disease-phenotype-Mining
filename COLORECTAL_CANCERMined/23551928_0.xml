<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite this, it remains an understudied, underreported, and undertreated issue in the field of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivorship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study examined the characteristics of women enrolled in an intervention trial to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e>, and explored the relationship between sexual functioning and psychological well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 70 female posttreatment anal or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> survivors assessed as part of the current study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were enrolled in a randomized intervention trial to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> and completed outcome measures prior to randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The main outcome measures are quality of life (QOL) (European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Core Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC-QLQ-C30] and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e>-Specific Module [QLQ-CR38]), sexual functioning (Female Sexual Functioning Index), and psychological well-being (Brief Symptom Inventory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo>, Impact of Events Scale-Revised, CR-38 Body Image) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women enrolled in the study intervention were on average 55 years old, predominantly Caucasian (79%), married (57%), and a median of 4 years postprimary treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For those reporting sexual activity at baseline (N = 41), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> was associated with a range of specific measures of psychological well-being, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the hypothesized direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Sexual/Relationship Satisfaction subscale was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of psychological well-being (r = -0.45 to -0.70, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body image, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific posttraumatic distress were notable in their association with subscales of sexual functioning, while a global QOL measure was largely unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For sexually active female rectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153446" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">anal cancer</z:e> survivors enrolled in a sexual health intervention, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> was significantly and consistently associated with specific measures of psychological well-being, most notably Sexual/Relationship Satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that sexual functioning may require focused assessment by providers, beyond broad QOL assessments, and that attention to Sexual/Relationship Satisfaction may be critical in the development and implementation of interventions for this cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
