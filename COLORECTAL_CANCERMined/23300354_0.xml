<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the present study were to explore the views of breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors on their routine follow-up care, with respect to needs, preferences, and quality of follow-up, and their views on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specialist- compared with family physician (fp)-led follow-up care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In Nova Scotia, Canada, 23 cancer survivors (13 breast, 10 colorectal) participated in either a focus group or a one-on-one interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were asked to reflect upon their lives as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors and on the type and quality of care and support they received during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each focus group or interview was transcribed verbatim, and the transcripts were audited and subjected to a thematic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SIX THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED: My care is my responsibilityHow I receive information on follow-up careI have many care needsI want to be prepared and informedThe role of my fp in my <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> experience and follow-up careThe role of media Survivors often characterized the post-primary treatment experience as lacking in information and preparation for follow-up and providing inadequate support to address many of the care needs prevalent in survivor populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite valuing fp participation in follow-up care, many survivors continued to receive comfort and reassurance from specialist care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to the need to implement strategies that better prepare <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors for post-treatment care and that reassure survivors of the ability of their fp to provide quality care during this period </plain></SENT>
