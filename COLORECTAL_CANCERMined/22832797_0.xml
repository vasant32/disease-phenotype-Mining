<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: There is a paucity of national guideline for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> diagnosis in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated the present state of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> diagnosis methods using web-based survey to use as reference data for developing a guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multiple choice questionnaires of screening recommendations was sent via e-mail to members of the Korean Association for the Study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Intestinal Diseases</z:e> and primary care physicians who participated in the national colonoscopy surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 425 colonoscopists, a total 263 colonoscopists replied (response rate, 61.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most commonly recommended starting age for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> diagnosis was 50 years old in the average risk group, and 40 years old in groups who had a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (64.3% and 65.0% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgeons had a tendency to recommend screening in younger people than internist do </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight percent of physicians recommended screening colonoscopy to asymptomatic, average-risk patients as a first choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 2% of physicians chose sigmoidoscopy as a screening tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the initial colonoscopy showed a negative finding, over 60% of internists repeated the exam 5 years later, whereas 62% of surgeons did so within 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The starting age of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and the interval of the colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> examination are not uniform in various medical environments, and there is a discrepancy between the practical recommendations and western guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, a new evidence-based national practice guideline for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> diagnosis should be developed </plain></SENT>
