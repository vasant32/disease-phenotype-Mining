<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the prognostic role of VEGF, bFGF, PDGF-AA, EGF, HGF, and E-selectin in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX) chemotherapy protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who had evidence of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiogenic factors were measured before and after third cycle of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized into three groups, partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) groups, according to their clinical and radiologic evaluation after three cycles of XELOX chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (47.3 %) achieved partial response, 10 (26.3 %) stable disease, and 10 (26.3 %) progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEGF (63.20 Pg/ml vs. 19,79 Pg/ml; p &lt; 0.001), EGF (7.29 ± 3.08 Pg/ml vs. 4.79 ± 2.05 Pg/ml; p &lt; 0.011), HGF (618.16 ± 340.39 Pg/ml vs. 452.02 ± 217.18 Pg/ml; p &lt; 0.049), and PDGF-AA (691.68 ± 187.10 Pg/ml vs. 404.89 ± 168.47 Pg/ml; p &lt; 0.001) were significantly decreased in PR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PDGF-AA levels were also decreased in SD group (706.66 ± 206.66 Pg/ml vs. 389.79 ± 143.16 Pg/ml; p &lt; 0,001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VEGF, HGF, EGF, and PDGF-AA levels were decreased in PR group </plain></SENT>
