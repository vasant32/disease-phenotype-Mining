<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: KRAS mutation is widely accepted as a strong, negative predictive marker for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, including cetuximab and panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports demonstrated approximately 100 % concordance of KRAS status between primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>; however, mismatched KRAS status still occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: KRAS status was evaluated in 105 pairs of formalin-fixed primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> specimens by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA quality of patients displaying mismatched KRAS status between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was assessed using a Bioanalyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS status was successfully analyzed in 90/105 patients (85.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concordance rate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was 88.2 % in synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (n = 76) and 100 % in metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discordance in KRAS status was observed in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independent method validation revealed only five samples showed the same KRAS status between the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA quality assessment by a Bioanalyzer revealed that the median length of DNA samples in the peak concentration of the mismatched group was significantly shorter than those in the control group (153.5 vs 276.5 bp, P = 0.0059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the median value of the percentage of degraded DNA (0-200 bp) in each sample in the mismatched group was significantly higher than the control group (35.5 vs 22 %, P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the discordant results for these nine patients (18 samples) were due to low quality DNA, which may obscure polymerase chain reaction analysis, affecting sequencing reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Quality control and assurance of KRAS genotyping is critical, and standardization of the methodology is warranted </plain></SENT>
