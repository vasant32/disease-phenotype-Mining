<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study whether a low-residue diet impacts bowel preparation with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Endoscopist blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community-based outpatient ambulatory surgical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized to ingest either a low-residue diet of specified foods for breakfast, lunch, and snack or a clear liquid diet the day before the colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The quality of the bowel preparation was assessed using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subject satisfaction with bowel preparation, diet, and severity of side effects was measured by a visual analog scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred thirty subjects were recruited (114 clear liquid and 116 low residue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean preparation scores were not statistically different in either their segmental scores or total score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the low-residue arm reported significantly higher satisfaction with bowel preparation medication, diet, and entire preparation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Observed rates of side effects were low, and there was no statistical difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rate of procedural cancellation was significantly higher in the clear liquid group compared with the low-residue group (20% vs 9%, P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Single-center study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A low-residue diet did not impair the quality of bowel preparation achieved with split-dose oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> solution but did improve patient satisfaction </plain></SENT>
