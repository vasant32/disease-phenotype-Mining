<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One possible improvement may be to measure DNA isolated from exfoliated cells collected from the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This was a cohort study in a surgical clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were aged ≥40 years and referred for investigation of suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, previous gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, or recent investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A sample of the mucocellular layer of the rectum was taken with an adapted proctoscope (the Colonix system) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">Haemoglobin</z:chebi>, mean cell volume, ferritin, carcino-embryonic antigen and faecal occult bloods were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participation was offered to 828 patients, of whom 717 completed the investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three were lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two (10%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exfoliated cell DNA was higher (P&lt;0.001) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (median 5.4 μg/ml [inter-quartile range 1.8,12]) compared with those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (2.0 μg/ml [IQR 0.78,5.5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven variables were independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, including age (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02,1.08; P&lt;0.001) DNA (OR, 1.05; CI, 1.01,3.6; P=0.01), mean cell volume (OR, 0.93; CI, 0.89,0.97; P=0.001), carcino-embryonic antigen 1.02 per μg/l (CI, 1.00,1.04; P=0.02), male sex (OR, 2.0; CI, 1.1,3.6; P=0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> (OR, 2.4; CI, 1.3,4.5; P=0.007) and positive faecal occult blood (OR, 6.7; CI, 3.4, 13; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the DNA score was 0.65 (0.58-0.72) and for the seven variable model 0.88 (CI, 0.84-0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Quantification of exfoliated DNA from rectal cellular material has promise in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but this requires confirmation in a larger study </plain></SENT>
