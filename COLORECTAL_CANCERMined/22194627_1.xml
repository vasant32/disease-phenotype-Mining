<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite widespread interest in next-generation sequencing (NGS), the adoption of personalized clinical genomics and mutation profiling of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens is lagging, in part because of technical limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> are genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and often contain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/stromal cells, features that lead to low-abundance <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> that generate ambiguous results or reside below NGS detection limits, thus hindering the clinical sensitivity/specificity standards of mutation calling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied COLD-PCR (coamplification at lower denaturation temperature PCR), a PCR methodology that selectively enriches variants, to improve the detection of unknown mutations before NGS-based amplicon resequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used both COLD-PCR and conventional PCR (for comparison) to amplify serially diluted mutation-containing cell-line DNA diluted into <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> DNA, as well as DNA from <z:mp ids='MP_0002027'>lung adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After amplification of TP53 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> protein p53), KRAS (v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene homolog), IDH1 [isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18009">NADP(+)</z:chebi>), soluble], and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene regions, PCR products were pooled for library preparation, bar-coded, and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In agreement with recent findings, sequencing errors by conventional targeted-amplicon approaches dictated a mutation-detection limit of approximately 1%-2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, COLD-PCR amplicons enriched mutations above the error-related noise, enabling reliable identification of mutation abundances of approximately 0.04% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequencing depth was not a large factor in the identification of COLD-PCR-enriched mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the clinical samples, several missense mutations were not called with conventional amplicons, yet they were clearly detectable with COLD-PCR amplicons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for the TP53 gene was apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care shifts toward personalized intervention based on each patient's unique genetic abnormalities and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> genome, we anticipate that COLD-PCR combined with NGS will elucidate the role of mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, enabling NGS-based analysis of diverse clinical specimens within clinical practice </plain></SENT>
