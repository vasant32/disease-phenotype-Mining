<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the screening strategy (quantitative immunological test vs biochemical test) in a population-based screening program for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in Catalonia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The fourth round of a screening program for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with a fecal occult blood test was implemented in Hospitalet de Llobregat during 2008-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A biochemical test was offered to 50,227 individuals and a quantitative immunological test was offered to 12,707 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analysed differences according to the screening strategy in the following variables: acceptability of the target population (participation, dropouts, and adherence to colonoscopy), diagnostic accuracy (positive predictive value and detection rates), results (size and location of lesions, staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and resources (number of colonoscopies needed and time interval between the positive test and colonoscopy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participation was higher among individuals who used the immunological test (OR: 1.35; CI95%:1.27-1.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection rates for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were also higher for the immunological test, hightlighting the detection rate for high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (26.7‰ vs. 3.0‰) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value for high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was 45.0% and 46.9% in the immunological test and guaiac test, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of colonoscopies needed to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with the immunological test was almost two-fold than those needed with the guaiac test (13.6 vs 7.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The immunological test is a good screening strategy particularly sensitive for detecting high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it is paramount to have enough resources to assure the quality of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening due to the large number of colonoscopies that would be required </plain></SENT>
