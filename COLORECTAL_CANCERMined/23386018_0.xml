<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective survey conducted with 1617 records of patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at the institution between 2004 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> analyzed were of the colon and rectum, breast, prostate and lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variables used in the study were age, gender, stage of disease upon diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Researchers used an application called SisHCR for data collection, and ExcelÂ® for data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To ensure data safety and reliability, passwords were required for accessing files, spreadsheets were backed up on a weekly basis, and patients' CPF numbers were used to avoid data duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1617 records analyzed, 36.42% belonged to the topographic group of the breast, and approximately 40% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were 70 years of age or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stage II was prevalent, representing 44% of the sample, and the treatment most used was surgery (57% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study suggested that the Hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry database is an instrument capable of generating important information about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and that through this information, epidemiological studies can be carried out and the processes of management and care can be improved </plain></SENT>
