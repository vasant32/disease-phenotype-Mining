<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The case collection of this study is one of the largest sets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Asia, and serves as representative data for investigating genomic differences between ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We took comprehensive and high-resolution approaches to compare the clinicopathologic and genomic profiles of microsatellite instability (MSI) vs. microsatellite stability (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) in Taiwanese <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1,173 CRC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were collected from the Taiwan population, and sequencing-based microsatellite typing assay was used to determine MSI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide SNP array was used to detect CN alterations in 16 MSI-H and 13 MSS <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and CN variations in 424 general controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene expression array was used to evaluate the effects of CN alterations, and quantitative PCR methods were used to replicate the findings in independent clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These 1,173 CRC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> can be classified into 75 high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) (6.4%), 96 low-frequency MSI (8.2%) and 1,002 MSS (85.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 75 MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 22 had a BRAF mutation and 51 showed MLH1 promoter hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were distinctive differences in the extent of CN alterations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> and MSI-H subtypes (300 Mb vs. 42 Mb per genome, p-value &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, chr7, 8q, 13 and 20 gains, and 8p and 18 losses were frequently found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> but not in MSI-H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nearly a quarter of CN alterations were smaller than 100 kb, which might have been missed in previous studies due to low-resolution technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>514 expressed genes showed CN differences between subtypes, and 271 of them (52%) were differentially expressed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Genomic profiling of the two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> revealed significant differences in the extent and distribution of CN alterations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More than half of expressed genes showing CN differences can directly contribute to their expressional diversities, and the biological functions of the genes associated with CN changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> warrant further investigation to establish their possible clinical implications </plain></SENT>
