<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lethal-7 (let-7) family of microRNAs regulates KRAS activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A functional polymorphism (rs61764370) has been described in the let-7 complementary site (LCS6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized a possible association between this KRAS let-7 LCS6 polymorphism and the response to anti-EGFR treatments in KRAS and BRAF <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the association of the KRAS let-7 LCS6 polymorphism with the response in 100 refractory mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the real effect of this polymorphism in relation to the treatment administered, we also studied this association in an independent cohort of patients treated exclusively with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The KRAS let-7 LCS6 polymorphism was genotyped using the BioMark system in blood and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BRAF V600E mutation was analyzed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The KRAS let-7 LCS6 G-allele showed a statistically significant association with nonresponse to anti-EGFR-based treatment: 31.9% of patients with the T/T genotype presented a complete or a partial response versus no patients with T/G or G/G genotypes (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were observed in the patients who received chemotherapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support the pharmacogenetic role of the KRAS let-7 LCS6 polymorphism in predicting the efficacy of anti-EGFR-based therapy in mCRC patients with the KRAS and the BRAF <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype </plain></SENT>
