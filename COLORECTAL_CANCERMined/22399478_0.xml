<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quality of colonoscopy services can be determined by a set of indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify the quality of colonoscopy services provided for patients of family physicians in the Iowa Research Network (IRENE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quality of services was delineated by (1) presence of a colonoscopy report on the medical record, if the medical record indicated a colonoscopy had been completed, (2) cecal intubation rate, (3) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate, and (4) the content of the colonoscopy report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical record review was conducted in 14 IRENE offices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 581 medical records indicating a colonoscopy had been completed, 89 (15%) did not have a colonoscopy report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main reasons for having the colonoscopy were screening and obvious blood in the stool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyp</z:mpath> detection rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopies was 35%, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detction rate for screening colonoscopis for men was 31% and for women was 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Depth of insertion to the cecum was reached for 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Items least mentioned in the report were the time to complete the procedure and current medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 223 (45%) reports listed the follow-up interval for next colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Quality of colonoscopy services for this group of IRENE physicians was comparable to recommended standards of depth of insertion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Improvements are warranted to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopy reports and follow-up interval of next colonoscopy on a patient's medical record </plain></SENT>
