<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to analyse the effectiveness of portal vein ligation to achieve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the functional remnant volume (FRV) of the liver and to compare the results with portal vein embolisation in a series of patients with multiple bilobar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 2001 and September 2011 we performed a TSH in 41 patients with multiple bilobar colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A right PVL was performed in 23 patients with an insufficient FRV (three patients did not complete the second stage due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> and were excluded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We prospectively compare these results with the increased remnant volume obtained in 18 patients with right PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median FRV was higher in the patients with PVE, rising from 501 ml (range 309-703) to 636 ml (range 387-649), than those with PVL, rising from 510 ml (range 203-824) to 595 ml (range 313-1213) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median %FRVI was higher in the patients with PVE (median 40%; range 21-65%) than those with PVL (median 30%; range 21-60%) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PVL and PVE were effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases for obtaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the FRV before major liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right PVE obtains better results and should be used where necessary to achieve a further increase in volume </plain></SENT>
