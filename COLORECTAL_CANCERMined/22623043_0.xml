<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study was performed to elucidate the effect of deguelin on apoptotic pathways related to NF-κB signaling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells and on the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> xenograft mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied COLO 205 and HCT116 cells in the presence or absence of deguelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NF-κB signaling was examined by real-time RT-PCR for interleukin (IL)-8, by Western blotting for IκB phosphorylation/degradation, and by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was determined by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> staining and caspase-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the expression of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic factors by use of RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> xenograft mice, we evaluated the effect of deguelin on inoculated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, and apoptotic index was measured by the in vivo TUNEL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Deguelin significantly inhibited IL-8 gene expression, IκB phosphorylation/degradation, and DNA binding activity of NF-κB in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deguelin induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells in a dose and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Deguelin down-regulated expression of NF-κB-mediated antiapoptotic factors such as cFLIP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X(L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e>, the volume of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> treated with deguelin was significantly lower than that of the control, and the apoptotic index for deguelin-treated mice was much higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deguelin might be a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
