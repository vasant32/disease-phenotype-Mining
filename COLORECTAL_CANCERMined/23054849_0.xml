<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A survey was mailed in 2010 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals in Manitoba, Canada diagnosed in 2008/2009 with stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Respondents were asked to identify the main provider(s) of their follow-up care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those indicating a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> completed the Patient Continuity of Care Questionnaire (PCCQ), which assesses continuity of care upon discharge from hospital to community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quality of life (QOL) on the Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy--Colorectal (FACT-C) and the Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale was collected as well as demographic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 246/360 or 68.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most participants were Caucasian with a mean age of 70 and 18 months from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A single "main provider" of follow-up care was named by 47 %, most frequently a FP or oncologist, but a majority (53 %) indicated multiple providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four combinations of providers were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 106 respondents (43.1 %) who named a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> as a main provider completed the PCCQ and reported high scores on its five subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, lower FACT-C QOL scores (OR 2.72, CI 1.12-6.57) and male gender (OR 2.82, CI 1.11-7.18) predicted poorer evaluations of continuity of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Concern was highest regarding sexual function, body image, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, impact on work and recreation, and bowel control, and in those who were younger or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The organization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> follow-up care between providers is complex and variable, but patients followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> evaluate their transitions of care after treatment favorably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Specific clinical issues and higher risk groups are identified and may benefit from specific attention from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CANCER</z:e> SURVIVORS: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors are satisfied when their primary care provider becomes responsible for follow-up care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, this is less true for those who are having more challenges in recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These survivors should ensure that information transfer and support services are identified that will smooth this transition </plain></SENT>
