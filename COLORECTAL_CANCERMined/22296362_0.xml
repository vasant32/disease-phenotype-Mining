<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 100 patients were divided into two groups: the experimental group was treated with Aidi injection and FOLFOX4 while the control group was only administered FOLFOX4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After more than two courses of treatment, efficacy, quality of life and side effects were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate of experimental group was not significantly different with that of control group (P&gt;0.05), but differences were significant in clinical benefit response and KPS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Iin addition, gastrointestinal reaction and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> were lower than that of control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aidi injection combined with FOLFOX4 is associated with reduced toxicity of chemotherapy, enhanced clinical benefit response and improved quality of life of patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aidi injection deserves to be further investigated by randomized control clinical trails </plain></SENT>
