<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As one of the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers, colorectal</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is a major public health issue worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the identification of novel biomarkers to aid in the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to identify a novel protein biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and to identify its structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, a total of 99 serum samples from 73 CRC patients and 26 healthy controls were collected and analyzed by SELDI-TOF-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biomarkers were separated using HPLC and detected with MALDI-TOF-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The qualified peaks were ranked by p-value of non-parametric tests and the top 10 peaks displaying significant differences were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 protein biomarkers, the concentration of a 3.9‑kDa protein in the serum of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was much lower than that in the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the 3.9‑kDa protein was selected as a biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its separation and purification were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The structure of the 3.9-kDa protein biomarker was determined by LC-MS/MS, and was confirmed to be a fragment of serine/theonine kinase 4 (MST1/STK4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3.9‑kDa protein biomarker had high sensitivity and specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and its potential clinical application warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
