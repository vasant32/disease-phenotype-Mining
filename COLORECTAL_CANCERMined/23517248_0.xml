<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the results of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated within a large Dutch phase III trial (CAIRO), in which standard chemotherapy and standard safety eligibility criteria were used, to patients treated outside the trial during the trial accrual period in a representative selection of 29 Dutch hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-trial patients were identified by the Netherlands <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (NCR), and were checked for the trial eligibility criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NCR registered 1946 stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who received chemotherapy, of whom 394 patients were included in the CAIRO trial and 30 patients in other trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the CAIRO trial participation rate was 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 29 hospitals, 162 patients received chemotherapy in the trial and 396 patients received chemotherapy outside the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the non-trial patients, 224 patients fulfilled the trial eligibility criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of eligible non-trial patients was comparable to trial patients (HR 1.03, p = 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, non-eligible non-trial patients had a significantly worse outcome (HR 1.70, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333132" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common tumor</z:e> type that trial results have external validity, provided that standard eligibility criteria are being observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our finding of a worse outcome for patients not fulfilling these criteria strongly argues against the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatments in other patient categories than included in the original trials in which these treatments were investigated </plain></SENT>
