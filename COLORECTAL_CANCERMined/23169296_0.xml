<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, pilot phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab as first-line treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mCRC, &lt;70 years and with performance status 0-1 were included in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete and partial responses were observed in 4 (13.3%) and 17 (56.7%) patients, respectively (overall response rate (ORR)=70%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 53.6%-86.4%); 8 patients (26.7%) had stable disease and 1 had progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> was 10.2 months (95% CI: 7.1-13.4) and the overall median survival time was 30.3 months (95% CI: 18.8-41.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary R0 resection was performed in 11 (37%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> were observed in 16 (53%) and 7 (23.3%) patients, respectively, and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> observed in 2 (6.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxicity grade 2 or 3 was reported in 7 (23.3%) and in 2 (6.7%) patients, respectively, and grade 3 rush was reported in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FOLFOXIRI/cetuximab combination presented increased activity in terms of response rate and R0 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> resection, and merits further investigation, especially in patients with initially unresectable disease confined to the liver </plain></SENT>
