<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In opportunistic or individual screening endoscopy is the primary detection procedure offered to an asymptomatic individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In organized or mass screening proposed by National Health Authorities to a population, endoscopy is performed only in persons found positive to a filter selection test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The indications of primary upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy in opportunistic screening are increasingly developing over the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Organized screening trials are proposed in some regions of China at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>; the selection test is cytology of a balloon or sponge scrapping; they are proposed in Japan for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancer</z:hpo> with photofluorography as a selection test; and in Europe, America and Japan; for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with the fecal occult blood test as a selection test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Organized screening trials in a country require an evaluation: the benefit of the intervention assessed by its impact on incidence and on the 5 year survival for the concerned <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site; in addition a number of bias interfering with the evaluation have to be controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Drawbacks of screening are in the morbidity of the diagnostic and treatment procedures and in overdetection of none clinically relevant lesions </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic endoscopy is conducted in 2 steps: at first detection of an abnormal area through changes in relief, in color or in the course of superficial capillaries; then characterization of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the lesion according to the Paris classification and prediction of the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and depth of invasion, with the help of chromoscopy, magnification and image processing with neutrophil bactericidal index or FICE </plain></SENT>
