<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of a recent change in operative technique from standard (S-APR) to extralevator resection (E-APR), the perineal part of the procedure is now performed with the patient in a prone jackknife position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of this change on stoma function is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim was to determine stoma-related complications and the individual patient experience of a stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> operated on with APR in one institution in 2004 to 2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Recurrent cancer</z:e>, palliative procedures, pre-existing stoma and patients not alive at the start of the study were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from hospital records and the national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was sent out to patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 44 months (13-84) after primary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were alive in February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventy seven agreed to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients (90 %) returned the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Stoma <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was more common for E-APR, 34 % vs. 10 %, but bandaging problems and low stoma height were more common for S-APR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the patients' experience of stoma function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 35 % of the patients felt dirty and unclean, but 90 % felt that they had a full life and could engage in leisure activities of their choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study indicates no difference in stoma function after 1 year between S-APR and E-APR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Over 90 % of the patients accept their stoma, but our study indicates that more information and support for patients are warranted </plain></SENT>
