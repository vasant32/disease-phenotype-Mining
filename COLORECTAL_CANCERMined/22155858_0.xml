<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Serum PIGF were measured in 70 healthy controls and in 80 stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also the association between preoperative sPGF levels, clinicopathological features and patients survival were evaluated in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: sPIGF levels in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were significantly higher than those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between sPIGF levels and clinicopathological features and sPIGF is not a prognostic factor for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed the sPIGF levels (hazard ratio=3.28; 95% CI=1.10-9.5, p=0.032) to be significant independent factors for local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum PIGF levels in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients are significantly higher compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and may be an indicator of local recurrence in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
