<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to look at the use of PET versus contrast-enhanced CT (ce CT) scans on the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with CLM undergoing laparoscopic RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients who had PET scans pre-RFA and post-RFA were identified from a prospective IRB-approved database within a 14-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings of PET scans were compared to those of ce CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival, Cox proportional hazards, t test, and chi square analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 134 patients had PET scans prior to laparoscopic RFA and 104 (28%) had PET/CT scans in follow-up, with comparison ce CT done within a month in 82 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In follow-up, PET/CT findings were equivalent to ce CT in 55 patients (67%), superior in 22 (27%), and inferior in 5 (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-RFA or post-RFA PET imaging did not affect overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients in whom the benefit of PET/CT was most were those with multiple bilobar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although, there was no survival benefit, PET/CT was superior to ce CT in demonstrating recurrence after RFA in about a quarter of the patients with CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients who would benefit most from a PET/CT seem to be those with multiple and bilobar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, who develop liver recurrence in follow-up after RFA </plain></SENT>
