<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two features are frequently disrupted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> such that critical genes succumb to inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-aza-dC) is an agent which inhibits DNA methyltransferase, and holds great potential as a treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, yet the extent of its effectiveness varies greatly between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous evidence suggests expression status after 5-aza-dC exposure cannot be explained by the DNA methylation status alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: We sought to identify chromatin changes involved with short and long term gene reactivation following 5-aza-dC exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines, HCT116 and SW480, were treated with 5-aza-dC and then grown in drug-free media to allow DNA re-methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation and chromatin modifications were assessed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing and Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased H3 acetylation, H3K4 tri-methylation and loss of H3K27 tri-methylation were associated with reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylated genes that did not show increased acetylation were transiently expressed with 5-aza-dC treatment before reverting to an inactive state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three reactivated genes, CDO1, HSPC105 and MAGEA3, were still expressed 10 days post 5-aza-dC treatment and displayed localised hypomethylation at the transcriptional start site, and also an increased enrichment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 acetylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that hypomethylation alone is insufficient to reactivate silenced genes and that increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">Histone</z:chebi> H3 acetylation in unison with localised hypomethylation allows long term reversion of these epigenetically silenced genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that combined DNA methyltransferase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors may aid long term reactivation of silenced genes </plain></SENT>
