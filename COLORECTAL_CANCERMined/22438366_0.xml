<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To use a randomized design to compare patients' short- and longer-term experiences after computed tomographic (CT) colonography or colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: After ethical approval, the trial was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients gave written informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five hundred forty-seven patients with symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who had been randomly assigned at a ratio of 2:1 to undergo either colonoscopy (n = 362) or CT colonography (n = 185) received a validated questionnaire to assess immediate test experience (including satisfaction, worry, discomfort, adverse effects) and a 3-month questionnaire to assess psychologic outcomes (including satisfaction with result dissemination and reassurance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed by using Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and Ï‡(2) test statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients undergoing colonoscopy were less satisfied than those undergoing CT colonography (median score of 61 and interquartile range [IQR] of 55-67 vs median score of 64 and IQR of 58-70, respectively; P = .008) and significantly more worried (median score of 16 [IQR, 12-21] vs 15 [IQR, 9-19], P = .007); they also experienced more physical discomfort (median score of 39 [IQR, 29-51] vs 35 [IQR, 24-44]) and more adverse events (82 of 246 vs 28 of 122 reported feeling faint or dizzy, P = .039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, at 3 months, they were more satisfied with how results were received (median score of 4 [IQR, 3-4] vs 3 [IQR, 3-3], P &lt; .0005) and less likely to require follow-up colonic investigations (17 of 230 vs 37 of 107, P &lt; .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between the tests regarding 3-month psychologic consequences of the diagnostic episode, except for a trend toward a difference (P = .050) in negative affect (unpleasant emotions such as distress), with patients undergoing CT colonography reporting less intense negative affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT colonography has superior patient acceptability compared with colonoscopy in the short term, but colonoscopy offers some benefits to patients that become apparent after longer-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The respective advantages of each test should be balanced when referring symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
