<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have collected experimental data and formulated a compartmental model using ordinary differential equations to investigate how the compound affects cells in each stage of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to a control case in which no drug was used, we treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells with three different concentrations of the drug and fitted simulations from our models to experimental observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that RHPS4 caused a concentration-dependent, marked cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in treated cells, which is best modelled by allowing the rate parameters corresponding to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> to be sigmoidal functions of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the model is "identifiable", meaning that, at least in principle, the parameter values can be determined from observable quantities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find that at low concentrations RHPS4 primarily affects the cells in the G(2)/M phase, and that the drug has a delayed effect with the delay decreasing at larger doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the drug diffuses into the nucleus, the observed delayed effect of the compound is unexpected and is a novel finding of our research into this compound </plain></SENT>
