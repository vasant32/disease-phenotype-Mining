<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine the association between genetic polymorphisms of XRCC1 Arg399Gln(Gâ†’A) and response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>XRCC1 genotypes of totally 99 patients(37 stage III, 62 stage IV)with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy were detected by TaqMan-MGB probe allelic discrimination method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>And clinical response of 62 patients in stage IVafter 2 to 3 cycles of chemotherapy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also time to progress (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the genotype frequencies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, up to 52.53 % were G/G genotype, 9.09 % were A/A genotype, and 38.38 % were G/A genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response rate (CR+PR) of 62 patients in stage IV was 61.29 % (19/31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with G/G genotype showed enhanced respond to chemotherapy compared to those with G/A+A/A (x(2) = 5.6, P = 0.029; OR = 3.845, 95 %CI = 1.231 ~ 12.01, P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals with the G/G genotype had a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> of 10.0 (8.88-11.12) months, those with the G/A+A/A genotype had an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> of 5.0(4.26-5.74) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The log-rank test was marginally significant (x(2) = 29.20, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for stage, performance status, and chemotherapy regimen, showed that only XRCC1 G/G genotypes increases the OR significantly (OR = 3.555; 95 % CI, 2.119 ~ 5.963; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms is associated with the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy and time to progression in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism should be routinely detected to screen patients who are more likely benefit from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based treatment </plain></SENT>
