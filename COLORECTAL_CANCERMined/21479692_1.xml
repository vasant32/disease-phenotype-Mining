<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) gene encodes a transcription factor controlled by the WNT/Dvl/CTNNB1 and Hedgehog/TGFB pathways in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although PITX2 is reportedly involved in various functions, including tissue development by controlling cell growth, its significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our findings regarding abnormal PITX2 expression in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PITX2 expression was evaluated in 5 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines and 92 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell growth was evaluated after inhibition of PITX2 expression or after exogenous introduction of PITX2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PITX2 expression was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study of tissue samples indicated that PITX2 expression was significantly higher in cancerous tissue than in paired control tissue (P = 0.0471) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower PITX2 expression showed a poorer overall survival rate than those with higher PITX2 expression (P = 0.0481) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that PITX2 expression was an independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Experimental knockdown and introduction of PITX2 also demonstrated that the level of PITX2 expression is inversely associated with cell growth and invasion in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PITX2 expression is significantly related to the biological behavior of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and appears to be correlated with clinical survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study revealed a previously uncharacterized unique role and significance of PITX2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
