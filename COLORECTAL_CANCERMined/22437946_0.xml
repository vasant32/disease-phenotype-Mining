<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the factors associated with nonadherence to recommended colonoscopic surveillance intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study enrolled 296 patients who underwent screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The colonoscopies were performed by four endoscopists in the first or second year of fellowship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After each procedure, the endoscopists responded to a questionnaire that elicited information on the degree of concern for missed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (using a visual analog scale [VAS]), colonoscopic technical factors, and surveillance intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 296 patients, 105 (36%) were adherent and 191 (64%) and were nonadherent to the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in insertion time, withdrawal time, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate between the adherence and nonadherence groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endoscopy at cecal intubation was longer in the nonadherence group than in the adherence group (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with poor bowel preparation was higher in the nonadherence group than in the adherence group (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The endoscopist's concern for missed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was greater in the nonadherence group than in the adherence group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on multivariate analysis, only the endoscopist's concern was an independent factor associated with adherence to guidelines (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Poor bowel preparation, loop formation, and colonoscopy experience were independent factors associated with a high concern for missed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherence to the recommended guidelines was associated with the endoscopist's concern for missed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Improving colonoscopic skills and bowel preparation may decrease nonadherence to the recommended postpolypectomy surveillance interval </plain></SENT>
