<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a rural general hospital to provide care for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a small-volume practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of patients treated in a rural general hospital, between January 1993 and December 2002, was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatments and complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight patients had a final diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an equal male: female ratio and an average age of 69 years (40-88 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent underwent treatment with curative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postoperative complication rate was low (2% wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, 2.3% anastomotic leak rate) and Dukes-specific five-year survival was satisfactory (A &gt; 80%, B and C &gt; 60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study adds weight to the argument that even with low-volume workload, satisfactory results can still be obtained </plain></SENT>
