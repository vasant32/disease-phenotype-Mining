<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its predictive value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> still remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the expression of CD133 and clinicopathological features and the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients by performing a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies published up to December 2012 was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only articles in which CD133 antigen was detected in situ localisation by immunohistochemical staining were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis was done using RevMan 4.2 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that a total of 15 studies involving 810 CD133-high and 1487 CD133-low patients met the inclusion criteria for the analysis of 5-year overall survival (OS) rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a random-effects model, the results showed that CD133-high expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was an independent prognostic marker correlating with both OS rate (RR = 0.67, 95%CI 0.54-0.82, P&lt;0.01) and disease free survival (DFS) rate (RR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.52-0.96, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD133-high expression was also associated with more T3,4 tumor invasion, N positive and vascular invasion cases, corresponding to a risk difference of 1.12 (95%CI 1.01-1.23, P = 0.03), 1.31 (95%CI 1.06-1.63, P = 0.01) and 1.24 (95%CI 1.08-1.41, P&lt;0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, when types of histology, lymphatic invasion and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were considered, CD133 overexpression was not significantly related with these clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis results suggest that CD133 is an efficient prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Higher CD133 expression is significantly associated with poorer clinical outcome and some clinicopathological factors such as T category, N category and vascular invasion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
