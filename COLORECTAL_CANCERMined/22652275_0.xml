<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defective function of TLS polymerases result in chromosome instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of TLS genes on susceptibility and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs462779, rs11153292, rs373572 and rs2233004) of TLS genes were genotyped in the pilot cohort consisted of 516 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 503 controls, and then replicated in the replication cohort of 421 cases and 446 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies of rs462779 and rs373572 were significantly different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and controls in both two cohorts, even after it was adjusted by age, gender and smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis showed that rs462779 and rs373572 were significantly associated with both colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the frequency of AA genotype of rs373572 was significantly increased as compared with those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rs462779 and rs373572 exhibited remarkably cumulative effect on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (trend P value=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between other SNPs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that polymorphisms in TLS genes are associated with susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Chinese and might be a novel biomarker for the predication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
