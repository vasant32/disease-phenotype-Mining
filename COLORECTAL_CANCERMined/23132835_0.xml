<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine whether plasma concentrations of B vitamins and methionine are associated with methylation of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) among those at high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, i.e. patients with at least one histologically confirmed colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA) in their life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We used LINE-1 bisulfite pyrosequencing to measure global DNA methylation levels in leukocytes of 281 CRA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable linear regression was used to assess associations between plasma B vitamin concentrations and LINE-1 methylation levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> was inversely associated with LINE-1 methylation in CRA patients, while plasma methionine was positively associated with LINE-1 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study does not provide evidence that in CRA patients, plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentrations are positively related to LINE-1 methylation in leukocytes but does suggest a direct association between plasma methionine and LINE-1 methylation in leukocytes </plain></SENT>
