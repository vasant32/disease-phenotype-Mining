<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding how gender influences immunological mechanisms in health and disease and identifying gender-specific biomarkers could lead to specifically tailored treatment and ultimately improve therapeutic success rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T helper1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines (Th1/Th2) have pivotal roles in the homeostasis of Th1 and Th2 cell network functions in the immune response but sex steroids affect Th1/Th2 production in different ways and a natural sexual dimorphism in the immune response has been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate these differences further, we developed Th-cytokine data-driven models of the immune response and evaluated healthy subject peripheral blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent cohorts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> patients were also studied for comparison purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the interferon (IFN)Î³ production pathway for immune response homeostasis is specific to men whilst the interleukin- (IL-) 6 production pathway for immune response homeostasis is specific to women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IL-10 pathway for restoring immune system resting homeostasis was common to both but was controlled by the respective gender-specific pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These gender pathways could well be used as targets and biomarkers in translational research into developing new clinical strategies </plain></SENT>
