<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the profile of methylated genes by NimbleGen Microarray and the biologic functions by NIH-NAVID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, preliminary validation studies were done in six pairs of samples by MSP (methylation-specific PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 4,644 genes had a difference in methylation levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them 2,296 were hypermethylated (log2ratio &gt; 1), 2,348 genes were hypomethylated (log2ratio &lt; -1), in which 293 hypermethylated and 313 hypomethylated genes were unmapped according to the NIH-NAVID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these genes were randomly distributed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, chromosome 1 contained the most of the hypermethylated genes (232 genes), followed by chromosome 19 (149 genes), chromosome 11 (144 genes), chromosome 2 (141 genes), chromosomes 3 (127 genes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Through the analysis of the statistics, There were 2 hypermethylated/3 hypomethylated genes involved in six pairs of samples simultaneously, followed by 10/14 in five samples, 34/37 in four samples, 101/113 in three samples, 341/377 in two samples, 1,808/1,804 in one sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to gene ontology analysis, some physiological processes play important roles in the cell division and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, DNA repair, immune, cell cycle, cell cycle checkpoint, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and invasion etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Through Preliminary validation, there were two genes (St3gal6, Opcml) in thirty top-ranking genes shown hypermethylated in six pairs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions High density DNA methylation microarrays is an effective method for screening aberrantly methylated genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The methylated genes should be further studied for diagnostic or prognostic markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
