<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify the dietary patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients in our region, the level of dietary advice currently received and its impact on behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A survey was taken of an opportunistic sample of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients at Dunedin and Invercargill Hospitals, New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary patterns were classified according to previously utilised criteria and the level of information they had received was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patients reported receiving dietary information from their doctor or nurse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one percent of patients felt they received too little information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> patients were less likely to consider that diet was important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e>, but were more likely to be interested in receiving dietary information than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight percent wanted additional dietary information and 75% would consider changing their diet in response to such information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors reported they were prepared to change their diet following diagnosis and treatment, however they report receiving insufficient information to meet their needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An opportunity for dietary intervention that may improve patient outcome is presently being missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a result of this study a comprehensive information package tailored to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors has been developed </plain></SENT>
