<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has long been observed that many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells exhibit increased aerobic glycolysis and rely more on this pathway to generate ATP and metabolic intermediates for cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key enzyme in glycolysis and has been known as a housekeeping molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that GAPDH expression was significantly up-regulated in human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues compared to the adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, and also increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines compared to the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> colon mucosa cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of GAPDH was further elevated in the liver metastatic tissues compared to the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissue of the same patients, suggesting that high expression of GAPDH might play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> development and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we found that 3-bromopyruvate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (3-BrOP) preferentially inhibited GAPDH and exhibited potent activity in inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by causing severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3-BrOP at low concentrations (1-10 μM) inhibited GAPDH and a much higher concentration (300 μM) was required to inhibit hexokinase-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic effect of 3-BrOP was associated with its inhibition of GAPDH, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with loss of p53 were more sensitive to this compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that GAPDH may be a potential target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
