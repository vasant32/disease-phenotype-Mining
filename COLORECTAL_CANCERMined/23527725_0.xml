<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate ADAM28 and Insulin Like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3 (IGFBP-3)) gene expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues with regard to the overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> status of the patients using an oligonucleotide microarray technique </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The examined patients were divided into two groups; those with BMI greater than or equal to 25 and those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 18 specimens of non-neoplastic colon tissues, which were divided between overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body weight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gene transcriptional activity from the specimens was analysed using an oligonucleotide microarray technique </plain></SENT>
