<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with bevacizumab as first-line treatment between July 2007 and April 2009 were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were included in the analysis set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>Proteinuria</z:hpo> occurred in 29 patients: Grade 1 in 15 patients and grade 2 in 14 patients; no grade 3 or higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate did not increase with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (p=0.307) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 17.8 months in cases with grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, 16.0 months in those with grade 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, and 10.4 months in those with grade 0 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (p=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis with a time-dependent adjustment, there was no correlation between severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> was not a predictive marker for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with first-line bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
