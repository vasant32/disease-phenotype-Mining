<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are limited population-based studies focusing on the chemopreventive effects of selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to assess the trends and dose-response effects of various medication possession ratios (MPR) of selective COX-2 inhibitor used for chemoprevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted using the Taiwan Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study comprised 21,460 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 79,331 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditional logistic regression was applied to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for COX-2 inhibitors used for several durations (5 years, 3 years, 1 year, 6 months and 3 months) prior to the index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients receiving selective COX-2 inhibitors, the OR was 0.51 (95% CI=0.29~0.90, p=0.021) for an estimated 5-year period in developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ORs showing significant protection effects were found in 10% of MPRs for 5-year, 3-year, and 1-year usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk reduction against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by selective COX-2 inhibitors was observed as early as 6 months after usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that selective COX-2 inhibitors may reduce the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by at least 10% based on the MPRs evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the limited number of clinical reports from general populations, our results add to the knowledge of chemopreventive effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in individuals at no increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
