<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This association has not been prospectively evaluated in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the association of overall glycemic index and glycemic load with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in a prospective cohort of Chinese women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 73,061 women aged 40-70 y and free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at enrollment were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Usual dietary intake was assessed at baseline (1997-2000) and reassessed during the first follow-up (2000-2002) through in-person interviews by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 9.1 y, 475 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glycemic load was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (P for trend = 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariable hazard ratio for the highest compared with the lowest quintile of glycemic load was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were also observed for associations with dietary glycemic index and total carbohydrate intake, and results did not vary by excluding individuals with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This prospective study, conducted in a population with a high intake of carbohydrates, provides no evidence that a high-glycemic index diet or high glycemic load is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
