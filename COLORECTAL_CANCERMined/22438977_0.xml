<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A considerable portion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have a high risk of disease recurrence after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients can be identified by analyzing the expression profiles of signature genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But there is no consensus on which genes should be used and the performance of specific set of signature genes varies greatly with different datasets, impeding their implementation in the routine clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead of using individual genes, here we identified functional multi-gene modules with significant expression changes between recurrent and recurrence-free <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, used them as the signatures for predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> recurrence in multiple datasets that were collected independently and profiled on different microarray platforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The multi-gene modules we identified have a significant enrichment of known genes and biological processes relevant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development, including genes from the chemokine pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most strikingly, they recruited a significant enrichment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results confirmed the functional relevance of these modules for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, these functional modules from different datasets overlapped significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrated that, leveraging above information of these modules, our module based classifier avoided arbitrary fitting the classifier function and screening the signatures using the training data, and achieved more consistency in prognosis prediction across three independent datasets, which holds even using very small training sets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
