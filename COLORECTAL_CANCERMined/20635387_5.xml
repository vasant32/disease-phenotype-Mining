<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple new agents targeted against the EGFR have been developed during the last decade, but treatment selecting criteria are still not clear </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive immunostaining for EGFR was evident in the central part in 176/386 (46%) of analyzed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar expression in both the central part and the invasive front was evident in 286/386 (74%) </plain></SENT>
