<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, its expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> may offer prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of FRα expression and other common molecular markers in resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To maximize potential biological differences, we selected two groups of patients with markedly different outcomes as study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of FRα expression and other common markers (thymidylate synthase, p53, p27, BCL2, ki67, MLH1, MSH2 and MGMT) on tissue microarrays was carried out on samples from 160 patients; 56 patients survived at least 10 years following liver resection, and 104 died within 2 years of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These markers were evaluated and compared with standard clinical predictors of outcome including a previously validated clinical risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that in addition to known clinical risk factors, FRα positivity was significantly associated with the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> group (32% compared with 13%; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the other common molecular markers were differentially expressed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, clinical risk score, margin status and FRα expression were independently associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specific multivariate comparisons confirmed that FRα expression was associated with outcome independent of the clinical risk score and margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that FRα expression is present in a subset of resected hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, and this marker is independently associated with survival after hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of FRα expression and the utility of FRα-targeted therapies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage-IV colorectal cancer</z:e> patients deserve further exploration </plain></SENT>
