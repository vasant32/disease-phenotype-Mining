<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Autophagy is a complex of adaptive cellular response that enhances <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell survival in the face of cellular stresses such as chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (CQ), a widely used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38068">antimalarial</z:chebi> drug, has been studied as a potential inhibitor of autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we aimed to investigate the role of CQ in potentiating the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU), the chemotherapeutic agent of first choice for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, in an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line colon26 was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the in-vivo study, colon26 cells were injected subcutaneously into BALB/c mice, which were treated with saline as a control, CQ (50 mg/kg/day), 5-FU (30 mg/kg/day), or the combination therapy (CQ plus 5-FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume ratio and body weight were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the sacrifice, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue protein extracts and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sections were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting for the analysis of autophagy-related and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins, and the terminal transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27243">uridyl</z:chebi> end labeling assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of CQ resulted in the inhibition of 5-FU-induced autophagy and a significant enhancement in the 5-FU-induced inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the combination treatment of CQ and 5-FU resulted in a significant increase in the ratio of apoptotic cells compared with other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of the proapoptotic proteins, namely Bad and Bax, were increased by the CQ treatment in the protein extracts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the combination therapy of CQ and 5-FU should be considered as an effective strategy for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
