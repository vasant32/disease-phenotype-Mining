<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire to assess the eligibility and interest in screening was mailed to 236,568 men and women, aged 55-64 years, who were randomly selected from six trial centers in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 56,532 respondents, interested and eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention group (invitation for flexible sigmoidoscopy; n = 17,148) or the control group (no further contact; n = 17,144), between June 14, 1995, and May 10, 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed on 9911 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed to compare the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality rates in the intervention and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Per-protocol analysis was adjusted for noncompliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 34,272 subjects (17,136 in each group) were included in the follow-up analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 10.5 years for incidence and 11.4 years for mortality; 251 subjects were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the intervention group and 306 in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall incidence rates in the intervention and control groups were 144.11 and 176.43, respectively, per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was noted in 65 subjects in the intervention group and 83 subjects in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates in the intervention and control groups were 34.66 and 44.45, respectively, per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the intention-to-treat analysis, the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence was statistically significantly reduced in the intervention group by 18% (rate ratio [RR] = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69 to 0.96), and the mortality rate was non-statistically significantly reduced by 22% (RR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.56 to 1.08) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the per-protocol analysis, both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality rates were statistically significantly reduced among the screened subjects; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence was reduced by 31% (RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.86) and mortality was reduced by 38% (RR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.96) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A single flexible sigmoidoscopy screening between ages 55 and 64 years was associated with a substantial reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality </plain></SENT>
