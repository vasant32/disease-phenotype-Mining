<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine wether the chemotherapy treatments used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> had an additional effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and on IDO activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples were collected from 27 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> treatment, 27 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> drugs plus monoclonal antibodies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi>-Mabs) and 15 non-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> had high plasma malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> (Trx) levels, and elevated IDO activity in plasma (IDOp) and in dendritic cells (IDOc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study shows that treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatics</z:chebi> have an effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> by increasing <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels and by decreasing Trx levels and IDO activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi>-Mabs showed no effect on <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels but decreased Trx levels, and the IDO activity showed values similar to the healthy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations between plasma IDO activity and the levels of Trx (r = 0.2062, p &lt; 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> (r = 0.2873, p &lt; 0.005) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our study suggests that IDO activity measured as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> levels could be used as a marker of the response to the chemotherapy treatments, although further studies are necessary </plain></SENT>
