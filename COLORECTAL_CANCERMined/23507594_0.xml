<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To confirm a standard procedure of CV port implant, we analyzed long-term outcomes and complications of upper arm CV ports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety patients implanted with CV ports in the upper arm between November 2006 and November 2009 were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no complications from the implanting procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2%)had complications, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>(n=10), occlusion(n=7), <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>(n=4)and persistent pain(n=1) (there is some overlapping) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients(20%)received surgery for removal of the ports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 160 days(range, 30-1,167days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that patients with a catheter tip above the tracheal bifurcation had a significantly higher risk for complications than patients with a tip below bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Upper arm CV ports were implanted safely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For long-term use, it is important to place the catheter tip below the tracheal bifurcation </plain></SENT>
