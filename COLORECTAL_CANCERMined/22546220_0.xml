<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gambogic acid has a marked anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect for gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent investigations on gambogic acid have focused mainly on mono-drug therapy, and its potential role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy has not been comprehensively illustrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the interaction between gambogic acid and docetaxel on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> cells and to investigate the mechanism of gambogic acid plus docetaxel treatment-induced apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was used to determine IC(50) values in BGC-823, MKN-28, LOVO and SW-116 cells after gambogic acid and docetaxel administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median effect analysis was applied for determination of synergism and antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Synergistic interaction between gambogic acid and docetaxel was evaluated using the combination index (CI) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was analyzed by Annexin-V and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) double staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of drug-associated genes, i.e., β-tublin III and tau, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related gene survivin, were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gambogic acid provided a synergistic effect on the cytotoxicity induced by docetaxel in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combined application of gambogic acid and docetaxel enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, gambogic acid markedly decreased the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of docetaxel-related genes, including β-tubulin III, tau and survivin, in BGC-823 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gambogic acid plus docetaxel produced a synergistic anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> cells, suggesting that the drug combination may offer a novel treatment option for patients with gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
