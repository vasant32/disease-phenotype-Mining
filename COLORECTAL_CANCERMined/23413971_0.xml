<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is aimed at determining the effect of recombinant Salmonella (SL3261)-based 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) vaccine on the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and the potential immune mechanisms in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with that in the PBS group, similar levels of 4-1BBL expression, the frequency of T cells, IFN-γ responses, and comparable numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were detected in the SL3261 and SL3261C groups of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, significantly fewer numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, increased levels of 4-1BBL expression in the spleens and colorectal tissues, higher frequency of peripheral blood and splenic CD3+CD25+ T cells, and stronger splenic T cell IFN-γ responses were detected in the SL3261R group of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that vaccination with recombinant attenuated Salmonella harboring the 4-1BBL gene efficiently enhanced T cell immunity and inhibited the development of carcinogen-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
