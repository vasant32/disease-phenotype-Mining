<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we reported a critical role of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) and documented it to be a prognostic biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic target for <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of EGFL8, the only known paralog of EGFL7, in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> is currently unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: EGFL8 expression in 101 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the clinicopathological features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were correlated with the EGFL8 down-regulation scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the survival curve and Cox regression model were also employed to assess the prognostic value of EGFL8 down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EGFL8 was significantly decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues (p&lt;0.0001) and the down-regulation of EGFL8 was evidenced in 74.3% (75/101) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGFL8 down-regulation correlated significantly to distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p=0.038) and high TNM stage (p=0.012) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with high EGFL8 down-regulation showed either poorer disease-free survival (p=0.0167) or poorer overall survival (p=0.0310) than those with low EGFL8 down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis identified EGFL8 down-regulation as an independent prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (hazard ratio, 12.974; p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The reduced expression of EGFL8 is closely related to metastastic potential and poor prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, suggesting the down-regulation of EGFL8 as a novel prognostic biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
