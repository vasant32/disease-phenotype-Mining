<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On incubation with the small intestinal contents while SC, SA1C, and SA4C were stable, A1C and A4C were degraded to liberate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the cecal contents, the other conjugates except for SC and SA4C were cleaved to release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the colon-specific delivery and activation of SA1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On oral administration of SA1C or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, no SA1C was detected in the blood and urine, indicating the limited absorption of SA1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SA1C delivered a much greater amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> to the large intestine while keeping the plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> at much lower level, which is consistent with no change of the serum level of 6-ketoprostaglandin F(1Î±) whose decrease is associated with the cardiovascular toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SA1C administered orally supplied a greater concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> for the whole colonic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, SA1C may be a colon-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> with improved therapeutic properties </plain></SENT>
