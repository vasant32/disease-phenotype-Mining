<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (GC) is high, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has significantly increased in Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the current screening for GC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> within East Asia by means of a questionnaire survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Representative members of the Committee of the International Gastrointestinal Consensus Symposium provided a questionnaire to physicians in six East Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 449 physicians participated in this survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> countries, more than 70% of physicians started GC screening between 40 and 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most popular method to screen for GC was endoscopy (92.7%), but combination methods such as Helicobacter pylori (HP) antibody, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> X-ray, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker with endoscopy differed by country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For HP-positive individuals, most physicians screened every year by endoscopy, and for individuals post-HP eradication, about half of physicians (56.3%) thought there was a need to follow-up with GC screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> physicians, the most common age to start <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was in the 40s (39.8%) and 50s (40.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Society Recommendations, a fecal occult blood test every year was the most popular method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, among each country, this test was most popular in only Japan (76.9%) and Indonesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In other countries, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years and total colonoscopy every 10 years were the most popular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There are similarities and differences in the screening of GC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among East Asian countries </plain></SENT>
