<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A structured search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and CINAHL databases was undertaken in July 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> published full text English language articles were searched that included a randomized or pseudo-randomized comparison of subjects who received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> vs subjects who did not in relation to their risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or advanced adenomatous lesions, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A weighted treatment effect (using fixed effects) was calculated across trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the risk of an adenomatous lesion was not increased (odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.93-1.28) among patients who received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> supplementation for up to 3 years; however, for those who received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> for over 3 years, the risk of an adenomatous lesion was increased (odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk associated with treatment was the highest for the occurrence of an advanced lesion (odds ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.10) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: At the 3-year colonoscopic follow up, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> supplementation had no effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While colonic surveillance beyond 3 years revealed an increased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, especially advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, among those participants randomized to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis challenges the results from epidemiological studies that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> status is inversely related to the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
