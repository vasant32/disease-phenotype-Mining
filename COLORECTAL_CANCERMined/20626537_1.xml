<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent UK policy has promoted routine monitoring of the performance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical databases are one method of collecting the detailed data required for clinically relevant analyses and of supplementing that collected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of patients, their treatment and surgical care recorded in the North Thames Prospective Audit of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> database compared with the Thames <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry database between 1999 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We defined the geographical area served by the prospective audit and extracted a registry dataset for the same area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the numbers, age, sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site and staging of patients in each database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportions recorded as receiving surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were compared over time, and clinical standards recorded for preventing post-operative complications and for specialist care were determined from the clinical database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical and registry databases differed in case mix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical database began to capture data on a larger number and wider range of patients over time, and generally included more complete staging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment trends differed between the databases, with the registry data showing lower proportions undergoing surgery and a slight increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> surgery over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a suggestion that a higher proportion of men received radiotherapy and chemotherapy than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recording of surgical standards in the clinical database was generally poor, although decreased leak and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates and post-operative mortality were suggested in the initial years of the audit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical database contributed some additional information on patient characteristics and the performance of services, but variable data quality and completeness prevented many planned analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Collecting additional data requires funded structures and quality assurance systems and such effort should focus on the data required to answer the most pressing clinical questions </plain></SENT>
