<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux combined with intermittent pneumatic compression (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) with <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> alone for VTE prophylaxis after resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Between June 2008 and March 2010, 137 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) who underwent colorectal resection in our surgical unit were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> group was treated with <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> alone as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fondaparinux group was treated with <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> and received subcutaneous injections of fondaparinux once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux combined with <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> alone for VTE prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The demographic variables and risk factors, operating time, blood loss and length of the postoperative hospital stay were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No clinically evident VTE, critical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No adverse reactions due to fondaparinux were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, receiving fondaparinux and <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> thromboprophylaxis was highly effective, well tolerated and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of combined modalities for VTE prophylaxis is justified in patients at high risk of VTE </plain></SENT>
