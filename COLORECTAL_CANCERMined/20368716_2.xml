<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies revealed a distinct correlation between inaccurate chromosome segregation, leading to chromosomal number instability, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of Aurora kinases A (AURKA) and B (AURKB) with overall survival (OS) by quantifying gene expression analysis and evaluation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples and assessing the associations with clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated intratumoral gene expression levels and SNPs of AURKA and -B from 41 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a high expression level of AURKB (&gt;1.28) lived significantly shorter (n=11, median OS=6.4 months, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-14.5 months) compared with patients with a low expression level (â‰¤ 1.28) (n=30, median OS=18.4 months, 95% CI: 14.7-27.8 months, P=0.026, Wald's test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients harboring any G-allele in AURKB 885A&gt;G showed a significantly decreased OS (P=0.05, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not find any associations with clinicopathological variables and AURKA gene expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a potential role for AURKB inhibition in patients with mCRC; thereby supporting its potential role as a target in mCRC </plain></SENT>
