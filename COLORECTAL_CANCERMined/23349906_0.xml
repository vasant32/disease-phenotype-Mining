<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amounts of CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ and ThPOK+ cells infiltrate in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa (NM), in dysplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (microadenomas, MA), the earliest detectable lesions in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, and in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), were measured, and the colocalization of ThPOK with the above-mentioned markers of immune cells was evaluated using confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, ThPOK showed a prominent increase since MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A strong colocalization of ThPOK with CD4 both in NM and in MA was observed, weaker in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, there was a peak in the colocalization levels of ThPOK with CD8 in MA, which was evident, although to a lesser extent, in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, according to the data of the present study, ThPOK may be considered a central regulator of the earliest events in the immune system during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development, decreasing the immune response against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
