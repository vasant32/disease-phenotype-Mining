<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyse the association between serum hCGβ recurrence, and survival, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of hCGβ were determined in serum collected preoperatively from 324 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, of whom 270 were curatively treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum concentrations of hCGβ were associated with increasing age and they were higher in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the 75th percentile (1.55 pmol/L) as a cut-off for serum hCGβ, overall survival (OS) was shorter in patients with elevated concentrations (HR 1.95; 95% CI 1.39-2.74; P=0.004), and this association was stronger in women (P=0.022) than in men (P=0.061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses including age, disease stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> differentiation, vascular invasion and CEA, high serum hCGβ concentrations remained an independent prognostic factor for adverse OS in women (HR 2.26; 95%CI 1.39-3.67), but not in men (HR 0.78; 95%CI 0.41-1.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same trend was observed for disease free- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specific survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High serum concentration of hCGβ is an independent prognostic factor for adverse outcome in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
