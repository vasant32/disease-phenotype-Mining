<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The occurrence of KRAS mutations and their association with prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients is not well documented in population-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility of identifying archived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens, and through linkage with nationwide Danish population-based databases to investigate the prevalence of KRAS mutations and their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Danish Pathology Database to identify the physical location of primary (or in some cases secondary) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens from selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients referred to our hospital for palliative chemotherapy between November 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routinely stored paraffin tissue blocks were obtained from the pathology archives of the originating hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status was assessed for each patient using the commercialized TheraScreen KRAS Mutation Kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the unique identifier number, we linked the patients to the Danish National Registry of Patients and the Danish Civil Registration System to obtain data on date of first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis and follow-up status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We estimated prevalence of KRAS mutations and the 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis using the Kaplan-Meier technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 106 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (64% males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were successfully linked to the registries, and archived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-tissue samples were obtained and analyzed in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of KRAS mutations was 55%, and 1-, 2-, and 5-year overall survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis was 91%, 68%, and 25%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is feasible to use Danish population-based registries to obtain archived tissue samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, and to estimate prevalence of KRAS mutation and subsequently evaluate the association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
