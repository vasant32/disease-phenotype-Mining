<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whole genome-scale integrated analyses of exon array and array-comparative genomic hybridization are expected to enable the identification of unknown genetic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated this approach in 22 gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines, focusing on protein kinase genes and genes belonging to the cadherin-catenin family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regarding alternative splicing patterns, several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines predominantly expressed isoform 1 of protein kinase A catalytic subunit beta (PRKACB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paired <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> specimens demonstrated that isoform 1 of PRKACB was a novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related variant transcript in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the exon array analysis clearly identified exon 3 or exon 3-4 skipping in catenin beta 1, a short intron insertion with exon 9 skipping in CDH1, and a deletional transcript of CDH13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These abnormal transcripts were shown to have arisen from small genomic deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, an integrated analysis of 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> cell lines revealed that four cell lines amplified fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, with truncated forms observed in two of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene amplification, and not the truncated form, was found to determine the sensitivity to a fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor, indicating that our cell line panel might be useful for cell-based evaluations of specific inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using an integrated analysis, we identified several abnormal transcripts and genomic alterations in gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our approach might enable genetic changes to be identified more efficiently, and the present results warrant further investigation using clinical samples and integrated analyses </plain></SENT>
