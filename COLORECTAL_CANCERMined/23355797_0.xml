<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> is believed to be a multi-stage process that originates with a localized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, which linearly progresses to an intra-mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, to an invasive lesion, and finally to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This progression model is supported by tissue culture and animal model studies, but it is difficult to reconcile with several well-established observations, principally among these are that up to 25% of early stage (Stage I/II), node-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) develop distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and that circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells are undetectable in peripheral blood samples of up to 50% of patients with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, but more than 30% of patients with no detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> exhibit such cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism responsible for this diverse behavior is unknown, and there are no effective means to identify patients with pending, or who are at high risk for, developing metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NOVEL FINDINGS: Our previous studies of human breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> have shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> invasion arises from the convergence of a tissue injury, the innate immune response to that injury, and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stem cells within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> capsules at the site of the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal degeneration of a capsule due to age or disease attracts lymphocyte infiltration that degrades the degenerating capsules resulting in the formation of a focal disruption in the capsule, which selectively favors proliferating or "budding" of the underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our recent studies suggest that lymphocyte infiltration also triggers <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> by disrupting the intercellular junctions and surface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules within the proliferating cell buds causing their dissociation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, lymphocytes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells are conjoined through membrane fusion to form <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-lymphocyte chimeras (TLCs) that allows the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stem cell to avail itself of the lymphocyte's natural ability to migrate and breach cell barriers in order to intravasate and to travel to distant organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our most recent studies of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have detected nearly identical focal capsule disruptions, lymphocyte infiltration, budding cells, and the formation of TLCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our studies have further shown that age- and type-matched node-positive and -negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have a significantly different morphological and immunohistochemical profile and that the majority of lymphatic ducts with disseminated cells are located within the mucosa adjacent to morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing epithelial structures that express a stem cell-related marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NEW HYPOTHESIS: Based on these findings and the growth patterns of budding cells revealed by double immunohistochemistry, we further hypothesize that metastatic spread is an early event of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and that budding cells overlying focal capsule disruptions represent invasion- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-initiating cells that follow one of four pathways to progress: (1) to undergo extensive in situ proliferation leading to the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nests that subsequently invade the submucosa, (2) to migrate with associated lymphocytes functioning as "seeds" to grow in new sites, (3) to migrate and intravasate into pre-existing vascular structures by forming TLCs, or (4) to intravasate into vascular structures that are generated by the budding cells themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also propose that only node-positive cases harbor stem cells with the potential for multi-lineage differentiation and unique surface markers that permit intravasation </plain></SENT>
