<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that isoforms of QKI proteins, which include QKI5/6/7/7b in human cells, play important roles in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparison with QKI5/6/7, however, there are little data on QKI7b due to lack of specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we reported the preparation and initial characterizations of polyclonal antibodies against human QKI7b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a chemically synthesized C-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fragment of human QKI7b, we raised two preparations of rabbit antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that these antibodies were able to recognize human QKI7b, but not QKI5/6/7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our immunofluorescence staining showed that in LO2 hepatocytes, QKI7b localizes predominantly in the perinuclear cytoplasm and less abundantly in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In clinical samples, we showed that like QKI5/6/7 proteins, QKI7b protein was also significantly downregulated in most human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These antibodies, therefore, might be useful in future functional studies of QKI7b </plain></SENT>
