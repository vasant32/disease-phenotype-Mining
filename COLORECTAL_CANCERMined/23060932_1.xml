<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the improved ability to detect mutations in recent years, tissue specimens cannot always be procured in a clinical setting, particularly from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrence of tumors</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether plasma is able to be used for mutation analysis instead of tissue specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We collected plasma from 62 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) prior to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA extracted from plasma and matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in KRAS were amplified from the tissue specimens and sequenced by regular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature (COLD)-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma KRAS gene mutation on codon 12 (GGT&gt;GAT) was detected using a nested COLD-PCR/TaqMan(Â®) -MGB probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in plasma and matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation on codon 12 (GGT&gt;GAT) was found in 13 (21.0%) plasma specimens and 12 (19.4%) matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The consistency of KRAS mutations between plasma and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was 75% (9/12), which indicated a high correlation between the mutations detected in plasma DNA and the mutations detected in the corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA (P&lt;0.001; correlation index, k=0.649) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, four (6.5%) patients with plasma DNA mutations had no detectable KRAS mutations in the corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, and three (4.8%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA mutations had no detectable KRAS mutations in the corresponding plasma DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, KRAS mutations in plasma DNA correlate with the mutation status in matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study provides evidence to suggest that plasma DNA may be used as a potential medium for KRAS mutation analysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using the COLD-PCR/TaqMan-MGB probe method </plain></SENT>
