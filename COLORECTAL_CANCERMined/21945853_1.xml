<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant RAGE activation was reported to promote the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the effects of RAGE on the regulation of cell viability, invasion, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating these interactions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RAGE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were evaluated in five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines and in 45 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue specimens (using immuohistochemistry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RAGE expression was then knockdown using RAGE shRNA for assessing cell viability and invasion assays as well as for tube formation and CAM assays in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and chick embryos, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RAGE was highly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues, and was associated with increased microvessel density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the four RAGE shRNA constructs were able to significantly knockdown RAGE expression in SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RAGE knockdown inhibited invasion capacity of SW480 cells, but did not significantly affect cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the conditioned growth medium from stable RAGE shRNA-transfected cells suppressed tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> of chicken embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of RAGE inhibited expression of VEGF and SP1 protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data suggest that silence of RAGE expression could effectively inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
