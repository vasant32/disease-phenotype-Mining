<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carcinogenic compounds generated during meat cooking have been implicated as causal agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a family-based case-control study to investigate the association between polymorphisms in carcinogen metabolism genes (CYP1A2 -154A&gt;C, CYP1B1 Leu432Val, CYP2E1 -1054C&gt;T, GSTP1 Ile105Val, PTGS2 5UTR -765, EPHX1 Tyr113His, NAT2 Ile114Thr, NAT2 Arg197Gln and NAT2 Gly286Glu) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested for gene-environment interactions using case-only analyses (N = 577) and compared statistically significant results to those obtained using case-unaffected sibling comparisons (N = 307 sibships) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that CYP1A2 -154A&gt;C might modify the association between intake of red meat cooked using high temperature methods and well done on the inside and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (case-only interaction OR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.19-1.97; p = 0.0008) and the association between intake of red meat heavily browned on the outside and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> risk (case-only interaction OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.48-0.86; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that GSTP1 Ile105Val might modify the association between intake of poultry cooked with high temperature methods and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (p = 0.0035), a finding that was stronger among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results support a role for heterocyclic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> that form in red meat as a potential explanation for the observed association between diets high in red meat and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest a possible role for diets high in poultry cooked at high temperatures in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
