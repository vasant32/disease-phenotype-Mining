<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PML expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PML down-regulation was detected in 39 (52.7%) patients (14 complete and 25 partial PML loss) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RR was significantly lower (25.6%) in patients with PML down-regulation than in patients with preserved PML expression (60%) (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was 5.5 months when PML was down-regulated versus 11.9 months in case of preserved PML expression (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A statistical significant difference was also detected in OS (15.6 and 24.5 months, respectively, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The impact of PML down-regulation on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and OS was statistically significant also in a multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study represents the first evidence of a possible correlation between PML protein expression and outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>/fluoropyrimidine-based first line therapy </plain></SENT>
