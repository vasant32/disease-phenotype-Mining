<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, these associations are generally weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that an increase in IGF-1 over time would be a stronger risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related outcomes than the actual levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this analysis we utilized existing data from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating IGF-1 levels and molar ratios of IGF-1 to IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) were measured at three time points, within a 10-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations of increase of the two variables with the presence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> at the end of follow-up among participants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This included 143 individuals, from which 24 were diagnosed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the mean levels of IGF-1 and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 decline with age, ~ 30% of the participants showed an increase of at least fifteen percent ("ever increase") in one or both of these variables, compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a positive association between "ever increase" in IGF-1 or IGF-1/IGFBP-3 and the presence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>: ORs were 3.81 (95% CI: 1.30-10.8) and 2.83 (95% CI: 1.00-8.22), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association was found when analyzing the actual levels of both variables at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that an increase in circulating IGF-1 or IGF-1/IGFBP-3 may represent a disturbed GH/IGF1 homeostasis, which could favor the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> such as colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
