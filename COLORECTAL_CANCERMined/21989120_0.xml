<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For this reason, a theoretical model based on Markov chains is proposed to compare these strategies: fecal occult blood test, capsule endoscopy, once-life and twice-life colonoscopy, and no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model predicts the health state of a population of individuals aged from 50 to 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The numerical results show that the optimal timing for a once-lifetime colonoscopy screening method is before the age of 50 and that the twice-lifetime colonoscopy is the best screening strategy with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, it is the most expensive one if the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment costs are not included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model predicts that there is a minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence in the population when the second colonoscopy is appropriately timed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using specific data, this age was found to be 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The screening strategies probably save expenses on the treatment of the population and at the same time decreases mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Optimized twice-lifetime colonoscopy seems to be the most efficient strategy with respect to mortality and overall costs including subsequent treatment </plain></SENT>
