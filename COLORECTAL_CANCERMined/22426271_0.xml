<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to identify the predicting factors for oncological outcomes after curative resection in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital/referral center in South Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Between January 2000 and June 2010, 105 patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> after curative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients underwent pulmonary resection, and the remaining 58 were given chemotherapy and/or best supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were the predictive factors of survival and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 35.9-month median follow-up period, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 54.6% and 30.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, absence of adjuvant chemotherapy after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> (p = 0.003), presence of extrapulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (p = 0.001), elevated prelaparotomy serum CEA level (p = 0.015), and absence of pulmonary resection (p = 0.048) were independent prognostic factors for poor overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients who underwent pulmonary resection, the 3-year pulmonary recurrence-free survival rate was 78.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, elevated prelaparotomy serum CEA level (p = 0.018) and disease-free interval â‰¤ 12 months (p = 0.008) were independent risk factors associated with pulmonary re-recurrence after pulmonary resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This study took place at a single institution and had a small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although we admit, to some degree, the benefits of the selection mechanism, pulmonary metastasectomy from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may improve survival after curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant chemotherapy, extrapulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, and prelaparotomy CEA value are independent prognostic factors for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prelaparotomy serum CEA level may be an especially reliable predictor of both overall survival and recurrence-free survival after pulmonary metastasectomy in patients who undergo curative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
