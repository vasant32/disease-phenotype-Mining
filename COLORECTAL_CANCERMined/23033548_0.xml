<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study consisted of a theory-driven (health belief model) spiritually based intervention aimed at increasing screening among African Americans through a community health advisor-led educational series in 16 churches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a randomized design, churches were assigned to receive either the spiritually based intervention or a nonspiritual comparison, which was the same in every way except that it did not contain spiritual/religious content and themes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trained and certified peer community health advisors in each church led a series of two group educational sessions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study enrollees completed a baseline, 1-month, and 12-month follow-up survey at their churches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interventions had significant pre-post impact on awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four screening modalities, and self-report receipt of fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant study group differences in study outcomes, with the exception of fecal occult blood test utilization, whereas those in the nonspiritual intervention reported significantly greater pre-post change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both of these community-engaged, theory-driven, culturally relevant approaches to increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> awareness and screening appeared to have an impact on study outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although adding spiritual/religious themes to the intervention was appealing to the audience, it may not result in increased intervention efficacy </plain></SENT>
