<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alternative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing is fundamentally important for gene regulation, and aberrant processing is associated with the initiation and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deregulated Wnt signaling, which is the initiating event in the development of most cases of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), has been linked to modified <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing, which may contribute to Wnt-mediated colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crosstalk between Wnt signaling and alternative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing with relevance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> includes effects on the expression of Rac1b, an alternatively spliced gene associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, which exhibits alternative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing that is influenced by Wnt activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, Tcf4, a crucial component of Wnt signaling, also exhibits alternative splicing, which is likely involved in colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modulation of 3' end formation, including of the Wnt target gene COX-2, also can influence the neoplastic process, with implications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While many human genes are dependent on introns and splicing for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of gene expression, naturally intronless genes exist with a unique metabolism that allows for intron-independent gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effects of Wnt activity on the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> metabolism of the intronless Wnt-target gene c-jun is a likely contributor to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, a breakdown product of dietary fiber and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor, upregulates Wnt activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, and also modulates <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing; therefore, the interplay between Wnt activity, the modulation of this activity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, and differential <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> metabolism in colonic cells can significantly influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Determining the role played by altered <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing in Wnt-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> may lead to novel interventions aimed at restoring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> metabolism for therapeutic benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this minireview presents a brief overview of several aspects of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing of relevance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, which potentially influence, or are influenced by, Wnt signaling activity </plain></SENT>
