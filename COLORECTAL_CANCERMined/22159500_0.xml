<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Albeit the causes remain to be understood, epigenetic alterations have been suggested to play a role in the long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we developed a novel microarray platform based on methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MS-AFLP) DNA fingerprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The over 10,000 NotI sites of the human genome were used to generate synthetic primers covering these loci that are equally distributed into CpG rich regions (promoters and CpG islands) and outside the CpG islands, providing a panoramic view of the methylation alterations in the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arrays were first tested using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line CW-2 showing the reproducibility and sensitivity of the approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We next investigated DNA methylation alterations in the colonic mucosa of 14 UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified epigenetic alterations affecting genes putatively involved in UC disease, and in susceptibility to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a strong concordance of methylation alterations (both hypermethylation and hypomethylation) shared by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells of the CW-2 cell line and the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> UC samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this work defines the first high-throughput aberrant DNA methylation profiles of the colonic mucosa of UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These epigenetic profiles provide novel and relevant knowledge on the molecular alterations associated to the UC pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some of the detected alterations could be exploited as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk predictors underlying a field defect for cancerization in UC-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
