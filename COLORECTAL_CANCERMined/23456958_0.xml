<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To improve stratification we examined (for the first time in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), whether analysis of GRP78 expression provides a predictive biomarker and performed functional studies to examine the role of GRP78 in sensitivity to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>396 CRC patient samples were collected in a prospective uniform manner and GRP78 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using a well-validated antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of GRP78 in 5-FU sensitivity was examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells using siRNA, drug inhibition and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GRP78 expression was significantly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue (P&lt;.0001), and correlated with depth of invasion (P=.029) and stage (P=.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased overall 5-year survival was associated with high GRP78 expression (P=.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> treated by surgery alone, with high GRP78 also had improved survival (71% v 50%; P=.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stage III patients with high GRP78 showed significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (52% v 28%; P=.026), whereas patients with low GRP78 failed to benefit (28% v 32%; P=.805) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low GRP78 was an independent prognostic indicator of reduced overall 5-year survival (P=.004; HR=1.551; 95%CI 1.155-2.082) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vitro, inhibition of GRP78 reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to 5-FU in p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GRP78 expression may provide a simple additional risk stratification to inform the adjuvant treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and future studies should combine analysis with determination of p53 status.
