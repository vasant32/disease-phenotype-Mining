<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> genetic and epigenetic features differ by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering a possible role of bowel contents (including microbiome) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, this study hypothesised that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> molecular features might gradually change along bowel subsites, rather than change abruptly at splenic flexure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Utilising 1443 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in two US nationwide prospective cohort studies, the frequencies of molecular features (CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability (MSI), LINE-1 methylation and BRAF, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations) were examined along bowel subsites (rectum, rectosigmoid junction, sigmoid, descending colon, splenic flexure, transverse colon, hepatic flexure, ascending colon and caecum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The linearity and non-linearity of molecular relations along subsites were statistically tested by multivariate logistic or linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of CIMP-high, MSI-high and BRAF mutations gradually increased from the rectum (&lt;2.3%) to ascending colon (36-40%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in the caecum (12-22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By linearity tests, these molecular relations were significantly linear from rectum to ascending colon (p&lt;0.0001), and there was little evidence of non-linearity (p&gt;0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153437" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Caecal cancers</z:e> exhibited the highest frequency of KRAS mutations (52% vs 27-35% in other sites; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequencies of CIMP-high, MSI-high and BRAF mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> increased gradually along colorectum subsites from the rectum to ascending colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These novel data challenge the common conception of discrete molecular features of proximal versus distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, and have a substantial impact on clinical, translational and epidemiology research, which has typically been performed with the dichotomous classification of proximal versus distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
