<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) represents an innovative tool in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> research pipeline, which is increasingly being used in clinical and pharmaceutical applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The unique properties of the technique, especially the amount of data generated, make the handling of data from multiple IMS acquisitions challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This work presents a histology-driven IMS approach aiming to identify discriminant <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> signatures from the simultaneous mining of IMS data sets from multiple samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of the developed workflow is evaluated on a set of three human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CRCLM) tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> IMS on tissue sections was performed using MALDI-TOF/TOF MS in both negative and positive ionization modes after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53003">1,5-diaminonaphthalene</z:chebi> matrix deposition by sublimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of both positive and negative acquisition results was performed during data mining to simplify the process and interrogate a larger lipidome into a single analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To reduce the complexity of the IMS data sets, a sub data set was generated by randomly selecting a fixed number of spectra from a histologically defined region of interest, resulting in a 10-fold data reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis confirmed that the molecular selectivity of the regions of interest is maintained after data reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Partial least-squares and heat map analyses demonstrated a selective signature of the CRCLM, revealing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> that are significantly up- and down-regulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This comprehensive approach is thus of interest for defining disease signatures directly from IMS data sets by the use of combinatory data mining, opening novel routes of investigation for addressing the demands of the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
