<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive science-driven approach towards markedly improved early detection/screening to efficacious targeted therapeutics with clear diagnostic and prognostic markers is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, further changes addressing rising costs, stemming from recent health care reform measures, will be brought about in part by changes in how care is reimbursed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo>, the advances in genomics and biomarkers have the potential to define subsets of patients who have a prognosis or response to a particular type of therapy that differs from the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Better definition of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>'s behavior will facilitate developing care plans tailored to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One method under study is episode-based payment or bundling, where one payment is made to a provider organization to cover <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expenses associated with a discrete illness episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Payments will be based on the average cost of care, with providers taking on a risk for overutilization and outliers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For providers to thrive in this environment, they will need to know what care a patient will require and the costs of that care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A science-driven "personalized approach" to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care has the potential to produce better outcomes with reductions in the use of ineffectual therapies and costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This promising scenario is still in the future, but progress is being made, and the shape of things to come for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care in the age of genomics is becoming clearer </plain></SENT>
