<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alcohol and tobacco use can be associated with an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and possibly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopies performed at our institution from January to December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient data were collected on age, sex, tobacco and alcohol history, and the presence of colon lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our data included 663 patients (643 men and 20 women) with a mean age of 60.7 years (range 23-89 years); 68.5% were current/former tobacco users, 53.7% were current/former alcohol users, 37.6% had used both, and 21.7% had used neither </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy findings were as follows 64% of patients had no lesions, 30.6% had tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 3.5% had villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and 2% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current use of tobacco, alcohol, or both was associated with the early development of colon pathology (ie, 66.9 years, 61.1 years, and 59.2 years [P &lt; .05], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nonusers, the mean age was 67.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our work confirms that the use of alcohol and tobacco is associated with an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of colon pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consideration should be given to modifying screening guidelines to include these habits as "high-risk" factors </plain></SENT>
