<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the programmed decision method and the theory in instrument development, the QLICP-CR was developed and evaluated based on the data measuring QOL thrice from a sample of 110 inpatients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The internal consistency Î± and the test-retest reliability for the overall scale and domains are above 0.70 and 0.79, respectively; the score differences between pretreatment and posttreatment have statistical significance for three domains and the overall instrument, with higher Standardized Response Mean of 0.61, 0.62, 1.33, and 0.80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The QLICP-CR is of good validity, reliability, and responsiveness </plain></SENT>
