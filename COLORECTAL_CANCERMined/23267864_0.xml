<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive approaches are needed to complement and improve upon current strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether plasma levels of miRNA can differentiate patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether plasma samples from patients with premalignant neoplastic lesions, such as advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (AAs), also had a different expression pattern of miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 196 plasma samples from 123 patients newly diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (63 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 60 with AAs) and 73 healthy individuals (controls) seen at 2 tertiary medical centers in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An initial set of samples was analyzed using a genome-wide miRNA expression profiling assay (n = 61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR was used to validate the expression of selected miRNAs in an independent cohort (n = 135) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or AAs had plasma miRNA expression profiles that differed significantly from those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We selected a group of 13 miRNAs for validation in an independent cohort of patients; 6 (miR18a, miR19a, miR19b, miR15b, miR29a, and miR335) were confirmed to be significantly up-regulated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, differentiating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from controls with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values ranging from 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.89) to 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59-0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only miR18a was confirmed to be up-regulated significantly in patients with AA, compared with controls, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.52-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have significantly different patterns of miRNA expression than healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These patterns might be developed as biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, although they have limited value in identifying patients with premalignant neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
