<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, novel treatment approaches are warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IGF-1R and its ligands, mainly IGF-1 and IGF-2, have been suggested to play pivotal roles in proliferation, survival and migration of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells of the colon/rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, interference with IGF-1R-mediated signaling may represent a therapeutic option for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses of 48 paired, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patient samples showed significant overexpression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> IGF-1R and IGF-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also an overexpression of MMP-7, which was significantly correlated with histopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, the effect of the IGF-1R-inhibitory cyclolignan picropodophyllin (PPP) was assessed in the four colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines HT-29, HCT-116, DLD-1 and CaCO-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PPP strongly and dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and migration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, when exposed to 0.5 ÂµM PPP, only HT-29 showed a net decrease of viable cells as compared with the cell number at the beginning of the experiment, a finding that coincided with decreased expression/phosphorylation of IGF-1R, AKT and ERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This cell line also exhibited PPP-induced downregulation of MMP-7 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar to the DLD-1 and HCT-116 cell lines, HT-29 also showed substantial cell detachment in response to PPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although a net reduction of cells by PPP seems to require a synchronized downregulation of IGF-1R, AKT and ERK1/2, part of the antitumor effect may be explained by other, possibly IGF-1R-unrelated mechanism(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such a multitude of inhibitory effects of PPP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells together with its low toxicity in vivo makes it a promising drug candidate in the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
