<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether characteristics of endoscopists, determined from administrative data, are associated with development of postcolonoscopy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (PCCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified individuals diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Ontario from 2000 to 2005 using the Ontario <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined performance of colonoscopy using Ontario Health Insurance Plan data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had complete colonoscopies 7 to 36 months before diagnosis were defined as having a PCCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had complete colonoscopies within 6 months of diagnosis had detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined if endoscopist factors (volume, polypectomy and completion rate, specialization, and setting) were associated with PCCRC using logistic regression, controlling for potential covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the study, 14,064 patients had a colonoscopy examination within 36 months of diagnosis; 584 (6.8%) with distal and 676 (12.4%) with proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had PCCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The endoscopist's specialty (nongastroenterologist/nongeneral surgeon) and setting (non-hospital-based colonoscopy) were associated with PCCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those who underwent colonoscopy by an endoscopist with a high completion rate were less likely to have a PCCRC (distal: odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.97; P = .03; proximal: OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> undergoing colonoscopy by endoscopists who performed polypectomies at high rates had a lower risk of PCCRC (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.89; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopist volume was not associated with PCCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopist characteristics derived from administrative data are associated with development of PCCRC and have potential use as quality indicators </plain></SENT>
