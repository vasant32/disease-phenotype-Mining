<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The quality of a colonoscopy depends on the operator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, quality indicators for colonoscopies performed by 5 endoscopists at a large Dutch hospital were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of successful colonoscopies per endoscopist ranged from 88-97% and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate (ADR) between 27-52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that the variation between these operators was great, but within proposed quality limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of procedures each operator had performed, however, is too small to draw this conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, ADRs were not adjusted for important differences between the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study shows that, in addition to operator expertise, several other factors determine the quality of a colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given its central role in national <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening, methods for assuring the quality of colonoscopy are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
