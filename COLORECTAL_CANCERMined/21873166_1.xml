<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is characterized by development at an early age, a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260037" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple tumors</z:e>, poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Special attention should therefore be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy-four patients with UC underwent surgery in our Department between July of 1985 and December of 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 22 had concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective study to investigate these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as a complication of UC was 12.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The male:female ratio was 14:8, and the average age at surgery was 54.6 (32-79) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, when examining the lesion type of UC, it was revealed that the total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> type accounted for 77.3% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases in UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding the site of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 14 out of the 22 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the distal end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average period from the development of UC to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 14.7 (0.6-40.5) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence rates over 10 and 20 years were 5.1% and 17.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histologically, poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were confirmed in 38.1% of the patients, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was also confirmed in 53.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260037" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple tumors</z:e> were confirmed at a rate as high as 27.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> detection through surveillance has increased, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was detected in 13 out of the 22 patients by routine surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In cases where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was detected by surveillance colonoscopy, 46.2% of lesions were early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We therefore consider that surveillance is useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, we experienced a case that could not be diagnosed by endoscopy that was successfully diagnosed by fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The case was noted to have stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cumulative incidence rates over 10 and 20 years were 5.1% and 17.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Since the average period from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of UC to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 14.7 years, routine surveillance examinations are necessary for patients with a history of UC of at least 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with strictures must be examined using both colonoscopy and fluoroscopy because diagnosis with colonoscopy alone may be inadequate </plain></SENT>
