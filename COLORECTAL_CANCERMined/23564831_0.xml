<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and FOLFOX are equivalent in respect to response rates, progression-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little data are available to compare their efficacy after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery and FOLFOX adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by FOLFIRI or FOLFOX for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> at presentation and no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end-point was the overall response rate (ORR) to first-line chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> after three months, as assessed by computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 205 patients received FOLFOX as adjuvant treatment for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> between 2006 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">Metastatic disease</z:e> was diagnosed later in 32 cases after a median follow-up of three years (range=1-5.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time between the beginning of adjuvant chemotherapy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> was 1.7 years (range=0.5-5.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients were evaluable for effects of treatment: six patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab and 22 FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ORR was 17% in the FOLFOX group versus 36% in the FOLFIRI group (p=0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This difference was not statistically significant, despite a trend in favor of FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">Metastatic disease</z:e> after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in the adjuvant setting tends to occur early and can be characterized by partial resistance to this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite insufficient statistical power, our results suggest that FOLFIRI may result in higher response rates than FOLFOX in this situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> re-challenge can also lead to radiological responses and disease stabilization </plain></SENT>
