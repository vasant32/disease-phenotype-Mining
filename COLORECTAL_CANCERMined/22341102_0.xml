<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate is an important measure of colonoscopy quality; however, factors including procedure order that contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate factors associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on patient and physician characteristics, trainee participation, time of day, and case rank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient tertiary-care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved consecutive patients presenting for first screening colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rates (proportion of cases with one or more lesion detected) and ratios (mean number of lesions detected per case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2139 colonoscopies were performed by 32 gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detection rates were 42.7% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 25.4% for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and 5.0% for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> detection was associated with male sex and increasing age on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the overall study cohort, time of day and case rank were not significantly associated with detection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In post hoc analysis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates appeared lower after the fifth case of the day for endoscopists with low volumes of cases and after the tenth case of the day for endoscopists with high volumes of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, time of day and case rank did not influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We observed a small but significant decrease in detection rates in later procedures, which was dependent on physician typical procedure volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings imply that colonoscopy quality in general is stable throughout the day; however, there may be a novel "stamina effect" for some endoscopists, and interventions aimed at improving colonoscopy quality need to take individual physician practice styles into consideration </plain></SENT>
