<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligibility included age 18-75 years, at least one measurable lesion, no prior chemotherapy except adjuvant chemotherapy, and Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group Performance Status (PS) 0-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>S-1 40 mg/m(2) b.i.d. on days 1-7 with 85 mg/m(2) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> on day 1 was repeated every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA from whole blood was analyzed for 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 8 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (median age 63 years, range 37-74) were enrolled: 37 men and 15 women; 44 with a PS of 0 and 8 with a PS of 1; and 41 with initially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> and 11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 51 evaluable patients, objective response rate was 47.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 32.9-61.2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up duration was 17.1 months (range 3.9-28.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.4 months (95% CI 4.8-8.1), and median overall survival had not been reached yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reported grade 3 toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (7.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (5.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> (7.7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (1.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no grade 4 toxicity or neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with A/G or G/G genotype in GSTP1 Ile105Val SNP had longer PFS than patients with A/A (median 8.3 vs. 6.1 months, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Biweekly S-1 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> is effective and has improved tolerability and convenience compared to other fluoropyrimidine with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GSTP1 Ile105Val SNP is associated with treatment outcomes </plain></SENT>
