<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Putative colorectal procarcinogens in tobacco smoke include <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33848">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</z:chebi> and heterocyclic aromatic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> that are known substrates of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferases (GSTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the influence of functional GST gene polymorphisms on the smoking-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> association in a population known to be minimally exposed to dietary sources of these procarcinogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (n = 480) and matched controls (n = 1167) were selected from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a population-based prospective cohort of 63â€‰257 men and women who have been followed since 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined the deletion polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 and the functional polymorphism at codon 105 of GSTP1 for each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A three level composite GST index was used to examine if GST profile affected a smoker's risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While there was no statistically significant association between cigarette smoking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk among subjects absent of any at-risk GST genotypes, smokers possessing two to three at-risk GST genotypes exhibited a statistically significant increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared with non-smokers (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this latter stratum, heavy smokers exhibited a &gt;5-fold increased risk relative to never-smokers (odds ratio, 5.43; 95% confidence interval, 2.22-13.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects with one at-risk GST genotype displayed a statistically significant but weaker association with smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that GST gene polymorphisms influence interindividual susceptibility to smoking-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
