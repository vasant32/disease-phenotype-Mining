<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Mucinous histology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has been associated with poor prognosis, however this has never been assessed in large well-defined study populations treated with the current used systemic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prognostic value of mucinous histology in two large phase III studies in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population included 1010 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who were treated with chemotherapy and targeted therapies in two phase III studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to the histology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> in mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (MC) and non-mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (AC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with MC (n=99) were older, had more often a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), extrahepatic localisation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> diameter and a higher T classification compared to patients with AC (n=911) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A deficient mismatch repair system and BRAF mutations were observed in 17% and 22% of patients with MC, compared to 3% and 7% in patients with AC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was investigated in both studies separately, showing a worse overall survival (OS), progression free survival and overall response rate in patients with MC compared to patients with AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with MC received less cycles of treatment compared to AC, but did not suffer from a higher incidence of grade 3/4 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, mucinous histology was as an independent negative prognostic factor for OS, resulting in a combined hazard ratio of 1.78 (95%confidence interval (CI) 1.35-2.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with metastatic mucinous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have distinct clinicopathological features and poor response to chemotherapy and targeted agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The strong negative prognostic value of MC warrants the use of this pathological feature as a stratification factor for clinical trials in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
