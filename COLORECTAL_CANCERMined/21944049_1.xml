<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used the database of the Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors predicting mortality after colon and rectum <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> resections were identified using logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using these models, expected mortality was calculated for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 8580 patients treated in 90 hospitals were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, hospitals' expected mortality ranged from 1.5 to 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average expected mortality was lower in patients treated in high-volume hospitals than in low-volume hospitals (5.0 vs. 4.3%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For rectum <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, hospitals expected mortality varied from 0.5 to 7.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average expected mortality was higher in patients treated in non-teaching and teaching hospitals than in university hospitals (2.7 and 2.3 vs. 1.3%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rectum <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients treated in high-volume hospitals had a higher expected mortality than patients treated in low-volume hospitals (2.6 vs. 2.2% p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no differences in risk-adjusted mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-risk patients are not evenly distributed between hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using the expected mortality as an integrated measure for case-mix can help to gain insight in where high-risk patients go </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The large variation in expected mortality between individual hospitals, hospital types and volume groups underlines the need for risk-adjustment when comparing hospital performances </plain></SENT>
