<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Macrophages are the chief component of the inflammatory infiltration that occurs early in the progression from non-invasive to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e>, with a switch from the pro-inflammatory phenotype to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-promoting phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> and stroma are additional sources of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study aimed to evaluate, during colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> from benign to malignant phases: i) the trend of serum levels of IL-8, IL-6, TGFβ1, VEGF and MMPs; ii) the parallel trend of CRP serum levels; iii) derangement of the principal TGFβ1 receptors (TGFβ1RI/RII) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 96 patients with colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at different stages of progression, and 17 controls, were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-8, IL-6, TGFβ1, VEGF, MMPs and CRP levels were analyzed before endoscopy or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TGFβ1 receptors were evaluated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> biopsies and surgically-removed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IL-8 in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients were increased from stage II, when also the enzymatic activity of MMP-9 increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of note, the increasing trend of the two serum markers was found significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Trend of serum CRP was also very similar to that of IL-8 and MMP-9, but just below statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TGFβ1 levels were lower at stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, while IL-6 and VEGF levels had no significant variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In tissue specimens, TGFβ1 receptors were already absent in about 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and this percentage of missing receptors markedly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stages III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined quantification of serum IL-8, MMP-9 and CRP, appears a reliable and advanced index of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related processes during malignant phase of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, since these molecules remain within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> bearing patients, while consistently increase in the blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, even if from stage II only </plain></SENT>
