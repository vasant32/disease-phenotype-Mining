<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined CXCR4, CXCL12 and CD133 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (CLM) and determined whether the expression profiles affect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment and thus progression, and whether they could serve as a prognostic marker for survival </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression profile of CXCR4 was determined in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line, SW48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of cytoplasmic CXCR4 was higher in 36 (39%) patients than that indicated by CXCR4 staining intensity of hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High levels of nuclear CXCR4 expression in 23 (25%) patients significantly correlated with CXCL12 expression in hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear CXCR4 expression was increased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells after exposure to CXCL12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the high levels of nuclear CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression in hepatocytes were significantly better prognostic factors for overall and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e>-free survival in patients with CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 in CLM may have an interactive effect that could alter the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CXCR4 expression in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> together with the upregulation of CXCL12 in hepatocytes may help to predict the clinical outcomes of patients with CLM after hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
