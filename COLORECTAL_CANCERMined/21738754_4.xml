<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is possible to infer the past of populations by comparing genomes between individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In general, older populations have more genomic diversity than younger populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The force of selection can also be inferred from population diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If selection is strong and frequently eliminates less fit variants, diversity will be limited because new, initially homogeneous populations constantly emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: Here we translate a population genetics approach to human somatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell populations by measuring genomic diversity within and between small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control tissue culture and xenograft experiments demonstrate that the population diversity of certain passenger DNA methylation patterns is reduced after cloning but subsequently increases with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When measured in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> gland populations, passenger methylation diversity from different parts of nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> was relatively high and uniform, consistent with older, stable lineages rather than mixtures of younger homogeneous populations arising from frequent cycles of selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diversity of six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was also high, suggesting dissemination early after transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diversity was lower in DNA mismatch repair deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> glands, possibly suggesting more selection and the elimination of less fit variants when mutation rates are elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The many hitchhiking passenger variants observed in primary and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell populations are consistent with relatively old populations, suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> leading to selective sweeps may be rare after transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Selection in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> appears to be a weaker than presumed force after transformation, consistent with the observed rarity of driver mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic plasticity rather than the stepwise acquisition of new driver mutations may better account for the many different phenotypes within human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
