<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality and morbidity principally by the detection and removal of <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colon polyps</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to retrieve resected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> to be able to ascertain their histologic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cause of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> retrieval failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel cancer</z:e> screening colonoscopy data were collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Program in the National Health Service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Screening participants were referred to our screening center after a positive fecal occult blood test result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A total of 4383 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were endoscopically removed from 1495 patients from October 2006 to February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The number, size, shape, and location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removal method; quality of bowel preparation; total examination time; and insertion and withdrawal times in collected data were examined retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> retrieval rate was 93.9%, and the failure rate was 6.1%, thus 267 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were not retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, factors affecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> retrieval failure were small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size, sessile <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and cold snare polypectomy (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyp</z:mpath> retrieval was less successful in the proximal colon (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size and method of removal were independent risk factors for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> retrieval failure (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size and cold snare removal were found to be significantly associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> retrieval failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It was difficult to retrieve small, sessile, and proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colon polyps</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Optical diagnosis could be an efficacious option as a surrogate for histologic diagnosis for these lesions in the near future </plain></SENT>
