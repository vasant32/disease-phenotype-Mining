<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There have been an increasing number of studies with evidence suggesting that the N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) and N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) genotypes may be implicated in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far the published data on this association has remained controversial, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a meta-analysis of case-cohort and case-control studies using a subset of the published data, with an aim to derive a better understanding of the underlying relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A literature search was performed using Medline database for relevant studies published through October 31, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 39 publications were selected for this meta-analysis, including 11,724 cases and 16,215 controls for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and 3,701 cases and 5,149 controls for CRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our pooled analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these studies, the results of our meta-analysis suggested that the NAT1 genotype was not significantly associated with an elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91-1.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that individuals with the rapid NAT2 genotype did have an elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for an association between the NAT1 and 2 rapid genotype and an elevated CRA risk (NAT1: OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.99-1.29; NAT2: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that individuals with NAT2 genotype had an elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for the association between NAT1 and 2 rapid genotype and CRA risk </plain></SENT>
