<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant DNA CpG island hypermethylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications are involved in the aberrant silencing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) is a H3K4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 Lys4) demethylase associated with gene repression and is overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LSD1 has also been implicated in targeting p53 and DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), with data suggesting that the demethylating activity of LSD1 on these proteins is necessary for their stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To examine the role of LSD1 we generated LSD1 heterozygous (LSD1+/-) and homozygous (LSD1-/-) knockouts in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line HCT116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deletion of LSD1 led to a <z:mp ids='MP_0000352'>reduced cell proliferation</z:mp> both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the knockout of LSD1 in HCT116 cells did not result in global increases in its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> substrate H3K4me2 (dimethyl-H3K4) or changes in the stability or function of p53 or DNMT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant difference in gene expression between cells containing LSD1 and those null for LSD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggested that LSD1 is critical in the regulation of cell proliferation, but also indicated that LSD1 is not an absolute requirement for the stabilization of either p53 or DNMT1 </plain></SENT>
