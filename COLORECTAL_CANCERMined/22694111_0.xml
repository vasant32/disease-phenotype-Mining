<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The use of anticancer drugs (chemotherapies) is an important determinant of national spending trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent policies have aimed to accelerate generic entry among chemotherapies to generate cost savings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the effects of generic entry on the choice of chemotherapy for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (MCRC) between 2006 and 2009 using autoregressivemoving average modeling with case control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A nationally representative sample of oncologists and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (aged â‰¥65 years) was employed to estimate the magnitude and significance of the impact of the generic entry of irinotecan in February 2008 on the number of administrations of irinotecan compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The generic entry of irinotecan resulted in a 17% to 19% decrease (P &lt;.001) in use among elderly patients with MCRC compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were robust to multiple sensitivity checks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel and robust estimates of the decline in use of a chemotherapy to treat a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the elderly after patent expiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest estimates from a previous Office of the Inspector General report of the potential savings derived from the generic entry of irinotecan for public payers are an overestimate, likely confounded by oncologists' response to financial incentives, changes in scientific evidence, and promotional activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As calls for improving the quality and cost efficiency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> increase, future empirical work is needed to examine the responsiveness of oncologists' treatment decision making to incentives among patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages and insurance types </plain></SENT>
