<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: EMR has emerged as an alternative therapeutic option for selected cases of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (ECC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the factors associated with resectability and curability of EMR for ECC remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical outcomes and factors related to resectability and curability in ECC cases treated with EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom EMR was performed for ECC at Severance Hospital between March 1997 and August 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 236 cases of ECC occurring in 231 patients (66.2% men) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Curative surgical resection and lymph node dissection were used in cases that were incompletely cured by EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Resectability, curability, and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete cure was achieved for 162 lesions (68.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 74 cases (31.4%), 69 (29.2%) were incompletely cured, and the other 5 (2.1%) had an undetermined resection status and ultimately required supplementary surgical resection for curative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Location on the right side of the colon, piecemeal resection, and submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were independently associated with incomplete resection, whereas depressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type was independently related to incomplete cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among the ECC cases completely cured by EMR and followed for more than a year (n = 118), local recurrence was observed in one case (0.8%) during the median follow-up period of 39.4 months (range 12.4-123.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Single-center, retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that EMR is feasible and could be an effective option for treatment of ECC if the technique is applied with the appropriate indications </plain></SENT>
