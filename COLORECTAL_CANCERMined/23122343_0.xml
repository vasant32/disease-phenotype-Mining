<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, preoperative staging for rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> has significant therapeutic implications and will direct the use of radiation therapy, surgical excision, or chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended for the initial evaluation for the preoperative assessment of patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the overall accuracy of CT varies directly with the stage of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, CT can accurately assess the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adding diffusion-weighted imaging to conventional MRI yields better diagnostic accuracy than conventional MRI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transrectal ultrasound can distinguish layers within the rectal wall and provides accurate assessment of the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> penetration and perirectal spread, and PET and PET/CT have been shown to alter therapy in almost one-third of patients with advanced primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment </plain></SENT>
