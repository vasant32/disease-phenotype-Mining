<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown variable rates of adherence to adjuvant therapy CPGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine the proportion of patients in Nova Scotia receiving CPG-concordant adjuvant chemotherapy within 12 weeks of surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 2001 to 2005, and to identify factors associated with chemotherapy receipt beyond 12 weeks from surgery or chemotherapy nonreceipt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with stages IIB or III colon or stages II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who underwent curative-intent surgery in Nova Scotia were identified through the provincial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry and anonymously linked to 14 administrative health databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chart review was conducted to obtain chemotherapy data and reasons for chemotherapy nonreceipt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with receipt of chemotherapy and meeting the 12-week benchmark (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,151 patients were identified, of whom 59% received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors predicting chemotherapy receipt were male sex, age &lt; 75 years, no hospital readmission within 30 days of surgery, stage III disease, no prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 679 patients who received chemotherapy, 479 (72%) met the 12-week benchmark, with male sex, urban residence, less social deprivation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of hospital stay as significant factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 472 patients who did not receive chemotherapy, the most common reason for nonreceipt was no consultation with a medical oncologist (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A number of factors influence adherence to adjuvant chemotherapy CPGs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and should be incorporated in future work as novel regimens enter clinical practice </plain></SENT>
