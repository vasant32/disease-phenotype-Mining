<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to know the present radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to assess the effective radiation doses used for CT colonography and its trend over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutions performing CT colonography research were asked to provide their CT colonography protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median effective doses were calculated and compared with a 2007 inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separate analyses were performed for protocols using intravenous contrast medium and for academic versus nonacademic institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in effective dose were tested for significance, using Wilcoxon rank-sum or Wilcoxon signed-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two of 109 (57%) institutions responded, providing protocols for 58 institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median effective dose for daily practice protocols was 7.6 mSv (4.3 mSv and 2.0 mSv for supine and prone, respectively) and for screening 4.4 mSv (2.6 mSv and 2.0 mSv, respectively; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For daily practice with and without contrast medium, the median effective doses were 10.5 mSv and 4.0 mSv (P &lt; .001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Academic and nonacademic institutions used similar doses (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For institutions also participating in the 2007 inventory, effective dose for both daily practice and screening protocols were similar (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In 2011 the median effective radiation dose for daily practice protocols was 7.6 mSv and for screening 4.4 mSv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median effective doses have not decreased as compared to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Academic and nonacademic institutions use similar radiation dose </plain></SENT>
