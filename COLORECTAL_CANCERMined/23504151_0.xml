<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Stage at diagnosis is an important prognostic factor for the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; it may be an indicator for quality of access to health care and is usually correlated with socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity/race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the association between stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at diagnosis with neighborhood of residence (as proxy for SES) and ethnicity/race, while controlling for each other, in selected areas of New York City (NYC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> summary data (1999-2008) were provided by the New York State <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multinomial logistic regression models were applied to calculate risk estimates for being diagnosed with late- or unknown-stage (versus early-stage) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in two low-SES and two high-SES neighborhoods of NYC and among several ethnic/racial groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> combined and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the female breast, lung, colorectum, and prostate, with additional adjustments for sex (for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> combined), age, and year of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 34,981 cancer cases were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant and independent ethnic/racial and neighborhood disparities in stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at diagnosis of most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of ethnicity/race on the disparity appeared stronger than the effect of neighborhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an overall decreasing trend in the proportion of late-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, particularly for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and to a greater extent in the proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> without staging information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population, ethnicity/race seems to be a stronger predictor for late stage at diagnosis than SES, stressing the need for ethnicity/race-oriented programs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening and improved access to care </plain></SENT>
