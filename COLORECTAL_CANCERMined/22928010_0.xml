<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that MPT0E028, a novel N-hydroxyacrylamide-derived HDAC inhibitor, inhibited human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> HCT116 cell growth in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of NCI-60 screening showed that MPT0E028 inhibited proliferation in both solid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological tumor</z:e> cell lines at micromolar concentrations, and was especially potent in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MPT0E028 had a stronger apoptotic activity and inhibited HDACs activity more potently than SAHA, the first therapeutic HDAC inhibitor proved by FDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo murine model, the growth of HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenograft was delayed and inhibited after treatment with MPT0E028 in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on in vivo study, MPT0E028 showed stronger anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> efficacy than SAHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant body weight difference or other adverse effects were observed in both MPT0E028-and SAHA-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results demonstrate that MPT0E028 has several properties and is potential as a promising anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapeutic drug </plain></SENT>
