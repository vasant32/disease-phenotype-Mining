<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> in recent years has increased from 5 months with best supportive care to nearly 2 years with chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab, an antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New prognostic and predictive biomarkers have been identified to guide chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, such as KRAS and BRAF oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the status of these oncogenes does not affect the efficacy of bevacizumab, and biomarkers predicting response to treatment with bevacizumab are still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of bevacizumab to regimens based on fluoropyrimidines or irinotecan has been shown to improve overall survival in treatment-na√Øve patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a significant increase in overall survival rate is achieved by adding bevacizumab to fluoropyrimidines and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in patients with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab has been found to be effective even when used as third-line therapy and later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, cohort studies have shown that bevacizumab improves survival significantly despite disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, bevacizumab therapy in the neoadjuvant setting for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> is well tolerated, safe, and effective </plain></SENT>
