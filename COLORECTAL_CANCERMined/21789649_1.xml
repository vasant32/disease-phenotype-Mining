<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether laparoscopic colorectal resection improved recovery within an enhanced recovery program was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was designed as a query of a prospectively maintained colorectal database to identify 350 patients who underwent elective colorectal resection with primary anastomosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized into two groups (laparoscopic and open resection), and demographic, treatment, and outcome variables were independently reviewed for accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A detailed fast-track protocol was prepared and distributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, department doctors, and nurses to standardize the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 209 patients underwent laparoscopic-assisted colorectal resection, and 141 had open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, BMI, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, comorbidity, previous abdominal surgery, preoperative chemoradiotherapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site, and AJCC 2002 staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients in the laparoscopic group required conversion to an open procedure due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extension, or technical difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic patients had earlier tolerance of diet, bowel movement, flatus and stool canalization, mobilization, suction drain removal, and interruption of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Length of postoperative stay was shorter (4 vs. 7 days, p = 0.0004) and fewer postoperative nonsurgical complications (3 vs. 13% p = 0.009) were registered for the laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that within an enhanced recovery program, laparoscopic resection may provide the best short-term clinical outcomes for patients with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
