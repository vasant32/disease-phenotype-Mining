<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared two chemotherapy regimens (FOLFIRI versus XELIRI) combined with bevacizumab, as first-line treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from blood samples of 173 patients participating in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed for selected SNPs (VEGF-1154, +936, -634, -2578 and -1498) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> candidate genotypes were evaluated for associations with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences with respect to the distribution of genotypes in the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The VEGF-1154 GG genotype was more frequent in patients not responding to treatment compared with responders (65.5 versus 39.8%, P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the VEGF-1154 GG genotype was associated with inferior median OS compared with GA (hazards ratio = 1.68; 95% confidence interval: 1.10-2.57; P = 0.016) or with the alternative genotypes (GA and AA) combined (hazards ratio = 1.62; 95% confidence interval: 1.09-2.40; P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the VEGF-1154 GG genotype remained a significant adverse factor for OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results support the potential predictive ability of VEGF genotypes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> receiving irinotecan-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, in terms of RR and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, current results should be validated prospectively, in larger cohorts </plain></SENT>
