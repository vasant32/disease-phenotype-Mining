<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the clinicopathological features and survival rates of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on a prospectively maintained institutional database (1981-2011) to identify patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological parameters, management and outcomes were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2,843 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One thousand six hundred and forty-two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 1,201 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following exclusion criteria, there were 29 patients with biopsy-proven colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, 22 of whom had UC and 7 had CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients had a preoperative diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; 16 of these were diagnosed at surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nodal/distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was identified at presentation in 47 and 71 % of the UC and CD group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Operative morbidity for UC and CD was 33 and 17 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the less favourable operative outcomes following surgery management of UC-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, overall 5-year survival was significantly better in the UC group compared to the CD group (41 vs. 29 %; p = 0.04) reflecting the difference in stage at presentation between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who undergo surgery for UC-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have less favourable short-term outcomes but present at a less advanced stage and have a more favourable long-term prognosis than similar patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and CD </plain></SENT>
