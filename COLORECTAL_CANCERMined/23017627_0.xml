<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To use a population-based method to assess the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35482">opioid analgesics</z:chebi> within the community among older persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and determine factors associated with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35482">opioid analgesics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were derived from a retrospective, linked administrative database study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2005 in Nova Scotia, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons who 1) were 66 years or older at the date of diagnosis; 2) died between January 1, 2001 and April 1, 2008; and 3) resided in health districts with formal palliative care programs (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>) (n=657) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with having filled at least one prescription for a so-called "strong" <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35482">opioid analgesic</z:chebi> in the six months before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were examined using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 36.7% filled at least one prescription for any opioid in the six months before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> covariates, filling a prescription for a strong opioid was associated with enrollment in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> (odds ratio [OR]=3.18, 95% CI=2.05-4.94), residence in a long-term care facility (OR=2.19, 95% CI=1.23-3.89), and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.14-2.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persons were less likely to fill a prescription for a strong opioid if they were older (OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.95-0.99), male (OR=0.59, 95% 0.40-0.86), and diagnosed less than six months before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.41-0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> may play an important role in enabling access to end-of-life care within the community </plain></SENT>
