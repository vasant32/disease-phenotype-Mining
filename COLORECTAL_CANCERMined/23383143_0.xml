<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) is highly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) tissues and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the biological functions and precise signals elicited by APRIL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have not been fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we used small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> to selectively deplete APRIL and to determine its tumorigenic effects in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line SW480 both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of APRIL in SW480 cells was associated with modulation of cell proliferation as well as reduction of cell migration and invasion in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover APRIL-knockdown SW480 cells displayed markedly inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> to the liver in immunodeficient mice upon subcutaneous injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we observed that downregulation of APRIL in SW480 cells resulted in greatly decreased activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed that recombinant human APRIL mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells resulting in induced expression of important cell cycle proteins and matrix metalloproteinases in a PI3K/Akt dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was concurrent with marked cell growth viability as well as increased cell migration and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these compelling data suggest that APRIL-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells may be accomplished through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may lead to a better understanding of the biological effects of APRIL and may provide clues for identifying novel therapeutic and preventive molecular markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
