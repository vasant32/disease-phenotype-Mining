<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of vaccine-induced clinical responses have not always been satisfactory partially because of DC incompetence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the feasibility of novel mature DCs for therapeutic adjuvants against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we conducted clinical trials with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-loaded DC quickly generated with a combination of OK432 (Streptococcuspyogenes preparation), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoid</z:chebi>, and interferon-α (OPA-DC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ten patients enrolled in this study, the OPA-DC vaccine was well tolerated and administered four times every 2 weeks except for two patients, who were switched to other treatments due to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the eight evaluable patients, one displayed stable disease (SD), while the remaining seven showed progressive disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the SD patient, natural killer (NK) cell frequency and cytolytic activity were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the same patient, the frequency of CEA-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) increased stepwise with repetitive vaccinations; however, most of the CTLs exhibited central memory phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, NK cells proliferated well regardless of failure of response, whereas CTLs failed to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the OPA-DC vaccine is well tolerated and has immune-stimulatory capacity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional modulation is needed to attain significant clinical impact </plain></SENT>
