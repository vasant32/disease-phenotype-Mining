<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel spatial multiscale model of a colonic crypt is described, which couples the cell cycle (including cell division) with the mechanics of cell movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The model is used to investigate the process of monoclonal conversion under two hypotheses concerning stem cell behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under the first hypothesis, 'stem-ness' is an intrinsic cell property, and the stem cell population is maintained through asymmetric division </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under the second hypothesis, the proliferative behavior of each cell is governed by its microenvironment through a biochemical signalling cue, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell division is symmetric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under each hypothesis, the model is used to run virtual experiments, in which a harmless labeling mutation is bestowed upon a single cell in the crypt and the mutant clonal population is tracked over time to check if and when the crypt becomes monoclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is shown that under the first hypothesis, a stable structured cell population is not possible without some form of population-dependent feedback; in contrast, under the second hypothesis, a stable crypt architecture arises naturally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Through comparison with an existing spatial crypt model and a non-spatial stochastic population model, it is shown that the spatial structure of the crypt has a significant effect on the time scale over which a crypt becomes monoclonal </plain></SENT>
