<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have conducted the first study to determine the diagnostic potential of the CD14++CD16+ intermediate monocytes as compared to the pro-angiogenic subset of CD14++CD16+TIE2+ TIE2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These monocyte populations were investigated by flow cytometry in healthy volunteers (N = 32) and in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients with localized (N = 24) or metastatic (N = 37) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further determined blood levels of cytokines associated with monocyte regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results revealed the intermediate monocyte subset to be significantly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and to show the highest frequencies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis identified intermediate monocytes as a significant independent variable in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a cut-off value at 0.37% (intermediate monocytes of total leukocytes) the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity ranged at 69% and 81%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TEM levels were elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796563,C1334407" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">localized cancer</z:e> but did not differ significantly between groups and none of the cytokines correlated with monocyte subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of interest, in vitro analyses supported the observation that intermediate monocytes were more potently induced by primary as opposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> cells which may relate to the immunosuppressive milieu established in the advanced stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, intermediate monocytes as compared to TIE2-expressing monocytes are a more sensitive diagnostic indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
