<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI) with multi-slice CT (MS-CT) in the detection and classification of focal liver lesions in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective study 68 patients who underwent DWI at 1.5 T (b-values of 50, 300 and 600s/mm(2)) and contrast-enhanced MS-CT were analysed by two radiologists blinded to the clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging results were correlated with intraoperative surgical and ultrasound findings (n=24), imaging follow-up or PET (n=44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of DWI and MS-CT in detection of focal liver lesions was compared on a per-lesion and a per-segment basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operator-characteristic (ROC) curves to determine the diagnostic performance and the sensitivities of correctly identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> on a segmental base were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For lesion detection, DWI was significantly superior to MS-CT both on a per-lesion (difference in sensitivities for reader 1 and 2 22.65% and 19.06%, p&lt;0.0001) and a per-segment basis (16.86% and 11.76%, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Especially lesions smaller than 10mm were better detected with DWI compared to MS-CT (difference 41.10% and 29.45%, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ROC-analysis showed superiority for lesions classification (p&lt;0.0001) of DWI (AUC: 0.949 and 0.951) as compared to MS-CT (AUC: 0.879 and 0.892, p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DWI was able to filter out metastatic segments with a higher sensitivity (88.2 and 86.5%) compared to MS-CT (68.0 and 67.4%, p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared to MS-CT DWI is both more sensitive in the detection of liver lesions and more accurate in determining the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and therefore might help to optimize therapeutic management in those patients </plain></SENT>
