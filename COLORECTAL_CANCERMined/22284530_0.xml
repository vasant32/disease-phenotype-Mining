<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Triage directly influences time to assessment and investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to establish whether urgency of referral of patients with large bowel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> has any effect on management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: An analysis was undertaken of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> referred by primary care and discussed at the regional colorectal multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings from January 2009 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> data were collated prospectively from MDT records, and operation and investigation reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 369 primary case referrals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 303 (82.1%) were urgent and 66 (17.9%) routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics (age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade) and resection rates were similar in both groups and no significant difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time from referral to diagnosis was significantly longer in the routine group (mean 73.7 days vs 30.2 days; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dukes stage was less advanced for the routine referral group, (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Urgency of referral decreased the time to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This did not influence resection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dukes stage was higher for urgent referrals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up is required to determine any impact on survival </plain></SENT>
