<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) arise from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and malignant potential is greatest in high risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is convincing observational evidence that red and processed meat increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and that higher levels of physical activity reduce the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no definitive randomised trial has demonstrated the benefit of behaviour change on reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> recurrence and no consistent advice is currently offered to minimise patient risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This qualitative study aimed to assess patients' preferences for dietary and physical activity interventions and ensure their appropriate and acceptable delivery to inform a feasibility trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients aged 60-74 included in the National Health Service <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme (NHSBCSP) were selected from a patient tracking database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a positive faecal occult blood test (FOBt), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had been diagnosed with an intermediate or high risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (I/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HRA</z:e>) at colonoscopy between April 2008 and April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interested patients and their partners were invited to attend a focus group or interview in July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A topic guide, informed by the objectives of the study, was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A thematic analysis was conducted in which transcripts were examined to ensure that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occurrences of each theme had been accounted for and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two main themes emerged from the focus groups: a) experiences of having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and b) changing behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants had not associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removal with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and most did not remember being given any information or advice relating to this at the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> of existing diet and physical activity levels was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a lack of readiness to change behaviour in many people in the target population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has confirmed and amplified recently published factors involved in developing interventions to change dietary and physical activity behaviour in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The need to tailor the intervention to individuals, the lack of knowledge about the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000745'>lack of motivation</z:hpo> to change behaviour are critical factors </plain></SENT>
