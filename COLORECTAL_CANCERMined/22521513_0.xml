<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The establishment of these circuitries during development is dependent on the correct guidance of axons to their targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that the well-known axon guidance molecule netrin-1 is required for configuring the circuitry that provides left-right alternating coordination in fictive locomotion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The attraction of commissural axons to the midline in response to netrin-1 has been shown to involve the netrin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> (deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the role of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> for the establishment of CPG coordination has not yet been resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that mice carrying a null mutation of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> displayed an uncoordinated left-right activity during fictive locomotion accompanied by a loss of interneuronal subpopulations originating from commissural progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> plays a crucial role in the formation of spinal neuronal circuitry coordinating left-right activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together with the previously published results from netrin-1 deficient mice, the data presented in this study suggest a role for the most ventral originating V3 interneurons in synchronous activities over the midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, it provides evidence that axon crossing in the spinal cord is more intricately controlled than in previously suggested models of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>-netrin-1 interaction </plain></SENT>
