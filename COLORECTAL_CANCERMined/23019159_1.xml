<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the mode of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> is not yet understood, it is commonly accepted that binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> to DNA prevents DNA synthesis and alters protein to DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the modified DNA-protein interaction and thus to understand the mechanisms leading to cellular misinterpretation of DNA information and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we have identified the preferential binding sites and the dynamics of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-DNA intrastrand and interstrand adducts at the oligomer level using high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) and HPLC/inductively coupled plasma-MS for quantitative studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a combination of benzonase, alkaline phosphatase and Nuclease S1 for digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This digestion procedure allows the study of platinated oligomeric <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> and more complex interstrand adducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The digestion products were mostly chromatographically separated and characterized using HPLC/ESI-ion trap MS/MS experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We could show that the adducts to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> are quite dynamic; that is, the ratios are changing for several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the resulting adducts provide evidence for the action of the digesting enzymes and indicate that the adduct spectrum at the oligomeric level is different to that at the commonly studies <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
