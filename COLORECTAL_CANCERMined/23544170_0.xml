<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) is greatly increased in chemotherapy-resistant (CR) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells that are enriched in undifferentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem/stem-like cells (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>/CSLCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that miR-21 plays a critical role in regulating differentiation of CR <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we observed that downregulation of miR-21 in CR <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells (HCT-116 or HT-29) by antisense miR-21 induced differentiation, as evidenced by marked increases in cytokeratin-20 (CK-20) expression and alkaline phosphatase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes were accompanied by a significant reduction in the expression of colon <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi>/CSLC marker CD44, colonosphere formation, and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) activity but increased the expression of proapoptotic programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 4 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of differentiation greatly increased sensitivity of CR <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells to the growth inhibitory properties of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three regimens tested: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FUOX), difluorinated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (CDF), and the combination of CDF and FUOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of inhibition of growth by either CDF (75%) alone or CDF + FUOX (80%) was much higher than that observed with only FUOX (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition by CDF and CDF + FUOX in differentiating CR <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells was associated with a 98% to 99% reduction in the expression of CD44 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, down-regulation of CK-20 in CR <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells produced no significant change in cellular growth in the absence or presence of FUOX, when compared with the corresponding controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current observation suggests that CDF and CDF + FUOX are highly effective in inhibiting growth and reducing colon <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>/CSLCs in anti-miR-21-induced differentiating CR <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells and supports our contention that differentiation enhances susceptibility of CR <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells to conventional and nonconventional therapeutic regimen </plain></SENT>
