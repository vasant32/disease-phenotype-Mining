<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD133 is considered a useful marker to identify the so-called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) and its expression has been shown to have prognostic significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to verify whether immunohistochemical evaluation of CD133 might correlate with the progression risk of stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Expression levels of the CD133 molecule were analyzed and compared in two series of stage I surgically resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients showing disease progression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for the disease and patients with no evidence of disease progression after at least 6 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive staining for CD133 was detected in 52% of the cases with poor prognosis and only in 9% of the group with good prognosis, and this difference was highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was detected between CD133 expression and histological parameters, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding, vascular invasion, and presence of lymph node micrometastases but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grading, gender, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival of CD133 negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were significantly longer compared to positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, CD133 staining confirmed to be a predictor of shorter survival independent from vascular invasion but not from lymph nodes micrometastases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that CD133 immunostaining is a useful predictor of high risk progression in stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and might help to identify patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
