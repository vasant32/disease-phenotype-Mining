<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guidelines in Denmark recommend gynecologic screening for female members of families with HNPCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We estimated the knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> risk and identified possible predictors of compliance with the screening among women from families with HNPCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire exploring the knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> risk and compliance with screening was sent to 707 women from families with HNPCC who had been recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate after one reminder was 86% (606 of 707) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed by simple and multivariable logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-one women were included in the final analyses; 65% reported being aware of the increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The awareness was significantly greater among women with high educational level (81%; P&lt;.001), women who had received genetic counseling (75%; P&lt;.001), women with family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699889" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gynecologic cancer</z:e> (76%; P&lt;.001), and those with high perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> risk (77%; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 67% had participated in gynecologic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in compliance regarding women's educational level or their family risk classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analyses of data in a multivariable logistic regression model showed that knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> risk was the most important predictor for positive compliance with the gynecologic screening (odds ratio 4.86, 95% confidence interval 3.05-7.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Women's awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> risk is the most important predictor of their compliance with gynecologic screening in families with HNPCC </plain></SENT>
