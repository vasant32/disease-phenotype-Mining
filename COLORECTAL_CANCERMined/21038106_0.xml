<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surveillance colonoscopy has been considered to be important for the early detection and early treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially in longstanding UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because it is not always easy to detect neoplastic lesions in UC endoscopically, guidelines recommend the use of step biopsy in surveillance, in which either 4 biopsy specimens for every 10 cm or a total of 33 or more biopsy specimens are obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it has been pointed out that a step biopsy obtaining several tens of biopsy specimens may not be an ideal method in terms of invasiveness to the patient or medical cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instead of step biopsy, recent studies report the usefulness of target biopsy, in which biopsy tissues are obtained only from regions suspected of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the Research Group for Intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e> of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan has initiated a randomized controlled study to compare the efficacy of step biopsy and target biopsy </plain></SENT>
