<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 59-year-old African American woman with a past history of T3N2M1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, who underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and wedge liver resection (segment IV A) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy was our subject for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve months later, she was found to have a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography positive liver lesion of 6.5 cm at the left lateral liver segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combined laparoscopic-transvaginal approach was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four 5-mm trocars were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The liver parenchyma was divided using the harmonic scalpel, whereas the left hepatic vein was transected using the laparoscopic transvaginal vascular stapler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specimen was placed in an endobag and extracted transvaginally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specimen size was 14×8×3.5 cm and that of the lesion was 6.5×5.7×4 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged on postoperative day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative time was 120 minutes and blood loss was minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged on postoperative day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No postoperative complications were found after 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery results in quicker recovery, less postoperative pain, and potential wound-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technique is safe and effective with excellent aesthetic results </plain></SENT>
