<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A common polymorphism at codon 72 of TP53 gene has been associated with increased risk for many human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p53 protein is expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but the reported prevalence of its expression varies widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the p53 protein expression in different genotypes of its codon 72 , was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We undertook a case-control study on 250 controls and 250 paraffin block specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> from the city of Isfahan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification of TP53 codon 72 polymorphism: TP53 codon 72 genotypes were detected by PCR using specific primer pairs for amplifying the proline or the arginine Alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PCR reaction was done separately for each of the two polymorphic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel in 1× TBE buffer and visualized on a transilluminator using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical Staining: We evaluated the expression patterns of p53 protein, as potential prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses: The χ2-test was used to assess the significance of any difference in the prevalence of TP53 codon 72 polymorphism between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio and 95% CI (confidence intervals) was used as a measure of the strength of the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance level was set to P≤0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In control samples, the genotype distribution for TP53 polymorphism showed 30.4%, 45.2% and 24.4% for the arginine/arginine, arginine/proline and proline/proline genotypes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Allelic frequencies corresponded to 0.663 for the arginine allele and 0.338 for the proline allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> group 38.8% of the cases were arginine/arginine, 40.4% were arginine/proline and 20.8% were proline/proline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The corresponding frequencies were 0.590 for the arginine allele and 0.410 for the proline allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A significant difference between cases and controls was found for the arginine/arginine genotype compared with (grouped) arginine/proline and proline/proline genotypes (Odds Ratio = 1.451 (1.002-2.103), P=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of p53 was observed in 50.8 percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens which most of them were arginine/arginine genotype (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>TP53 polymorphism and arginine/arginine genotype may be correlated with overexpression of p53 and increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in city of Isfahan </plain></SENT>
