<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The TOP1 gene, located at 20q12-q13.1, is frequently detected at elevated copy numbers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study explores the mechanism, frequency and prognostic impact of TOP1 gene aberrations in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and how these can be detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line metaphase spreads were analyzed by FISH with a TOP1 probe in combination with a reference probe covering either the centromeric region of chromosome 20 (CEN-20) or chromosome 2 (CEN-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections from 154 chemonaive stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, previously studied with TOP1/CEN-20, were analyzed with TOP1/CEN-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relationships between biomarker status and overall survival (OS), time to recurrence (TTR) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and time to local recurrence (LR; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> only) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TOP1 aberrations were observed in four cell line metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines CEN-2 was found to reflect chromosomal ploidy levels and therefore the TOP1/CEN-2 probe combination was selected to identify TOP1 gene gains (TOP1/CEN-2≥1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and three patients (68.2%) had TOP1 gain, of which 15 patients (14.6%) harbored an amplification (TOP1/CEN-20≥2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TOP1 gene gain did not have any association with clinical endpoints, whereas TOP1 amplification showed a non-significant trend towards longer TTR (multivariate HR: 0.50, p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Once amplified cases were segregated from other cases of gene gain, non-amplified gene increases (TOP1/CEN-2≥1.5 and TOP1/CEN-20&lt;2.0) showed a trend towards shorter TTR (univariate HR: 1.57, p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TOP1 gene copy number increase occurs frequently in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a mechanism that often includes CEN-20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using CEN-2 as a measurement for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> ploidy levels, we were able to discriminate between different mechanisms of gene gain, which appeared to differ in prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TOP1 FISH guidelines have been updated </plain></SENT>
