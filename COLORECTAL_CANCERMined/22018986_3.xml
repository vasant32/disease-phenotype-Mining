<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of NIRF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that NIRF expression was aberrantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and associated with poor overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics analysis indicated that NIRF was a putative target of the microRNA let-7a, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then demonstrated in vitro that enforced expression of let-7a, or knockdown of NIRF, led to reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell proliferation due to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and reduced cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, an in vivo tumorigenicity assay in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice showed that synthetic let-7a suppressed NIRF expression and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results provide new evidence that NIRF has an oncogenic role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This opens up the possibility of targeting NIRF and let-7a for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
