<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis aims to answer the question of whether first-line treatment of p.G13D mCRCs should include cetuximab or bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients with p.G13D mutant mCRC were pooled in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent systemic first-line treatment with a fluoropyrimidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>/irinotecan that was combined with either cetuximab or bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of cetuximab-based and bevacizumab-based regimens in mCRC patients with p.G13D-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> indicated comparable data for the overall response rate (58 vs. 57%) and progression-free survival (8.0 vs. 8.7 months; hazard ratio: 0.96, P=0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) was 20.1 months in patients treated with cetuximab-based first-line therapy compared with 14.9 months in patients receiving bevacizumab-containing regimens (hazard ratio: 0.70, P=0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regressions modelling OS revealed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based first-line treatment to correlate with a poor outcome (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a strong trend in favour of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> compared with infusional 5-FU (P=0.06) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment correlated with OS in patients receiving cetuximab-based, but not bevacizumab-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This retrospective pooled analysis suggests comparable efficacy of cetuximab-based and bevacizumab-based first-line therapy in patients with p.G13D mutant mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and irinotecan was associated with a more favourable outcome compared with infusional 5-FU and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
