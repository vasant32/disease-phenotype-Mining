<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many aetiological factors have been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development including genetic or non-genetic (environmental) elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Independently of these, three groups of alterations have been implicated: 1) <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> (CIN); 2) microsatellite instability (MSI); 3) CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A different multistep association between these alterations contributes to determine three distinct developmental pathways: traditional, alternative and serrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each genotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> assessment is associated with specific morphologic or clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathologists have to consider the morphologic and clinical features of each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> when study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with molecular tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromatin remodelling is extremely dynamic and depends on several DNA-based processes, such as transcription, DNA repair and replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recent results with whole genome sequencing in a vast array of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> have provided a catalogue of genetic lesions in chromatin modifiers that were previously unappreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It has revealed surprising facts about mutations in several SWI/ SNF complex members in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The loss of INI1 expression is detected at a low rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and may be associated with differentiation grade and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some results support the existence of crosstalk between EMT and epigenetic modifications in the MSI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We have summarized the role of genetic/epigenetic changes in the origin of the multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> pathway, taking into account current knowledge of pathogenesis and feasibility of designing novel therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
