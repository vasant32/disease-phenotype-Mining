<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggests that EphB4 plays key roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> in numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, therapies focusing on EphB4 have become potentially important components of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sensitivity to EphB4 suppression may not be uniform for different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) probes for EphB4 targeted imaging, based on EphB4-specific humanized monoclonal antibody hAb47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NIRF dye Cy5.5 was introduced to hAb47 either through the reaction with amino groups (named hAb47-Cy5.5) or sulfhydryl groups (named hAb47-Cy5.5<z:chebi fb="207" ids="25121">-Mal</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting probes were evaluated in both HT-29 xenograft and the mAb131 (anti-EphB4) treated models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although these methods lead to modifications of both the heavy chain and light chain of the antibody, the majority of the EphB4 binding affinity was maintained (81.62 ± 2.08% for hAb47-Cy5.5 and 77.14 ± 2.46% for hAb47-Cy5.5<z:chebi fb="207" ids="25121">-Mal</z:chebi>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>hAb47-Cy5.5 was then chosen for in vivo NIRF imaging of EphB4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In HT29 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> xenografts, hAb47-Cy5.5 demonstrated significantly higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake compared with that of the hIgG-Cy5.5 control, which was further confirmed by immunofluorescent staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hAb47-Cy5.5 successfully imaged the decreased EphB4 expression (confirmed by Western blot) in EphB4-targeted immunotherapy using another EphB4-specific antibody, mAb131 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, hAb47-Cy5.5 could be used as a specific NIRF contrast agent for noninvasive imaging of EphB4 expression, which may predict whether an individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> would likely respond to EphB4 targeted interventions, as well as monitor the therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
