<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate Ki-67 immunoexpressions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and analyze possible correlations with variable clinicopathological prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study of tissue sections from 50 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens were examined at the Histopathology Laboratory of Rezgary Teaching Hospital in Erbil, Iraq between January 2010 and July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 labeling index is calculated immunohistochemically using the monoclonal antibody MIB-1, and the standard streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> immunoperoxidase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathologic and prognostic features were statistically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over-expression of Ki-67 proliferation protein was found in 31 (62%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses revealed a significant relation between Ki-67 proliferation index and histologic type (p=0.005) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (p=0.018); but no significant relation was calculated with the other clinicopathological parameters such as age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>'s size, site, depth, stage, nodal status, and vascular invasion (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ki-67 immune overexpression is a frequent finding in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases; but it is not enough to monitor Ki-67 proliferation index alone for prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
