<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colorectal mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> are positive for MUC2 expression, whereas MUC2 is down-regulated in non-mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we down-regulated MUC2 expression by RNAi (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference) and investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects on the proliferation and invasion/migration potential of the LS174T human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LS174T cell line is a goblet-cell-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line that continuously produces high levels of MUC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of MUC2 expression in vitro by transfection of LS174T cells with the recombinant plasmid pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-MUC2 led to the production of a stably transfected MUC2-RNAi LS174T cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proliferation and invasion/migration of MUC2-RNAi cells in vitro were significantly higher than those in control cells, as assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi>], colony formation and transwell assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous injection of MUC2-RNAi LS174T cells into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice resulted in the development of subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> visible to the naked eye after 1 week </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ki67 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry in the xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of these proteins were higher in the MUC2-RNAi-derived xenografts than in xenografts derived from control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the role of MUC2 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> is not fully understood, these results strongly suggest a relationship between the proliferation and invasion of LS174T cells and the expression of MUC2 </plain></SENT>
