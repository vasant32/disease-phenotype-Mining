<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is considered technically difficult and performed only in specialized centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to report the initial experience from the Gastrocentro - Campinas State University for the treatment of gastric and colorectal lesions by endoscopic submucosal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The guidelines of the Japanese Association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>Gastric Cancer</z:hpo> were used as evaluative criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For colorectal lesions, the recommended standards proposed by Uraoka et al. and Saito et al. were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The practicability of the method, the development of complications and histological analysis of the specimens were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection from June 2010 to April 2011; nine patients were treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric lesions</z:e>, and seven were treated for colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average diameter of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric lesions</z:e> was 28.6 mm, and the duration of resection was 103 min without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions presented lesion-free margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, four were located in the rectum and three were located in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average size was 26 mm, and the average procedure time was 163 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two complications occurred during the rectal resection procedures: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, which was treated with an endoscopic clip, and controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of the lesions presented a compromised lateral margin without relapse after 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Depth margins were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> free of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopic submucosal dissection at our institution achieved high success rates, with few complications in preliminary procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The procedure also made appropriate lesion staging possible </plain></SENT>
