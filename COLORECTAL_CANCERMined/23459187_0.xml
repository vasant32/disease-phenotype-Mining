<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Current investigation for patients with colorectal symptoms without overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> is undertaken by colonoscopy or by flexible sigmoidoscopy and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large majority of patients do not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There exists no instant, objective measure to discriminate patients who are likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and therefore require expedient investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of immunological faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in patients with colorectal symptoms without overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients referred for urgent colonic investigation, were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A faecal sample was obtained from each one and subjected to immunological FOB which tested either negative or positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients then underwent complete colonic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation between FOBT status and results from colonic imaging was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 126 tested, thirty patients (26.8%) were FOBT positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twelve patients underwent complete colonic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the FOBT positive group colonic imaging identified 17 cases of histologically proven <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 1 recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of anus, 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath>, 6 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulosis</z:e>, and no pathology in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the 82 FOBT negative patients, no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall the Immunological Faecal Occult Blood Test was found to have 100% sensitivity and 86.3% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Immunological faecal occult blood testing is a sensitive and specific test in identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and may be useful in identifying those patients who warrant urgent investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Routine clinical application may be useful in the allocation of resources </plain></SENT>
