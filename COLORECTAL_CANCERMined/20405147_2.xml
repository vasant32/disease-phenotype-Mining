<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Individuals diagnosed and treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> often report high levels of distress, continuing even after successful treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spiritual well-being (SpWB) has been identified as an important factor associated with positive health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study had two aims: (1) examine the associations between SpWB (faith and meaning/peace) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes and (2) examine competing hypotheses of whether the relationship among distress, SpWB, and HRQL is better explained by a stress-buffering (i.e., interaction) or a direct (main effects) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study 1 consisted of 258 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors (57% men) recruited from comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers in metropolitan areas (age, M=61; months post-diagnosis, M=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study 2 consisted of 568 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors (49% men) recruited from a regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry (age, M=67; months post-diagnosis, M=19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants completed measures of SpWB (functional assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illness therapy-spiritual well-being (FACIT-Sp)) and HRQL (functional assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy-colorectal) in both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measures of general distress (profile of mood states-short form) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific distress were also completed in study 1 and study 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, faith and meaning/peace were positively associated with HRQL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, meaning/peace emerged as a more robust predictor of HRQL outcomes than faith </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Planned analyses supported a direct rather than stress-buffering effect of meaning/peace </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence of the importance of SpWB, particularly meaning/peace, to HRQL for people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies of SpWB and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> should examine domains of the FACIT-Sp separately and explore the viability of meaning-based interventions for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
