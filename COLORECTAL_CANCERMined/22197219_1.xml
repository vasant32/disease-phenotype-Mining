<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Serum CXCL5 levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were assessed to evaluate correlation with clinicopathologic features and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of CXCL5 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells were also investigated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on cytokine array analysis, CXCL5 was identified as a novel prognostic serum marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of CXCL5 were assessed in 250 CRC patients and 33 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and their relation to clinicopathologic findings and survival investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CXCL5 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines were also measured by ELISA, and CXCL5 and CXCR2 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the biological role of the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis, recombinant human CXCL5 and CXCR2 neutralisation antibodies were used for proliferation, migration and invasion assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative serum CXCL5 was significantly elevated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with healthy volunteers (p=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High serum CXCL5 was significantly associated with female sex (p=0.0098) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (p=0.0040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis correlated elevated CXCL5 with poor overall survival (p=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that elevated CXCL5 was a significant and independent prognostic factor of survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (p=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells secreted CXCL5, and administration of recombinant human CXCL5 promoted proliferation, migration and partial invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These effects were generally inhibited by CXCR2 neutralisation antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative serum CXCL5 could serve as a novel predictive marker for prognosis determination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CXCL5/CXCR2 axis might be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
