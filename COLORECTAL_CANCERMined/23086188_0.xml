<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies from our group have shown that the expression levels of MMP-7 were highly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patient specimens and were correlated with Dukes Staging, histological differentiation grade and CEA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to investigate the cellular impact of MMP-7 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used the SW480 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines of MMP-7 knockdown by lentivirus-mediated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference as a model system to investigate the impact of MMP-7 on cell proliferation and sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and X-ray irradiation (IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation and sensitivity to 5-FU and IR were measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and colony formation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle was evaluated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We showed that the down regulation of MMP-7 inhibits <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell proliferation and sensitizes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells to 5-FU and IR (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased MMP-7 expression in SW480 cells by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference triggered cell cycle arrest at G1 phase (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Down regulation of MMP-7 may inhibit the cell proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells and increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RNAi-mediated silencing of MMP-7 may represent a powerful therapeutic approach for controlling human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> growth </plain></SENT>
