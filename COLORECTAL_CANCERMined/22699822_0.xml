<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Early identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is an unresolved challenge and the predictive value of single symptoms is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the performance of QCancer (Colorectal) prediction model for predicting the absolute risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in an independent UK cohort of patients from general practice records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2.1 million patients registered with a general practice surgery between 01 January 2000 and 30 June 2008, aged 30-84 years (3.7 million person-years) with 3712 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> was defined as incident diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during the 2 years after study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results from this independent and external validation of QCancer (Colorectal) prediction model demonstrated good performance data on a large cohort of general practice patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QCancer (Colorectal) had very good discrimination with an area under the ROC curve of 0.92 (women) and 0.91 (men), and explained 68% (women) and 66% (men) of the variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QCancer (Colorectal) was well calibrated across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tenths of risk and over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age ranges with predicted risks closely matching observed risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: QCancer (Colorectal) appears to be a useful tool for identifying undetected cases of undiagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in primary care in the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
