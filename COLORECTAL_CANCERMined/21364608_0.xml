<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The association between meat consumption and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the difficulties in determining this association has been measurement of different attributes of meat consumption, including cooking methods and level of doneness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS/METHODS: We investigated the association between meat consumption and cooking practices and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a population-based case-control study in the Western Australian Bowel Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From July 2005 to February 2007, 567 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and 713 controls, who were frequency matched to cases for age- and sex, completed questionnaires on lifestyle and meat consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimated odds ratios (ORs) comparing meat consumption quartile groups were obtained from multivariate logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The amount of red baked meat consumed had a statistically significant inverse trend of association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (Q4 OR=0.73 95% confidence interval 0.53-1.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When frequency was multiplied by serving size and by doneness, the association remained protective but was no longer statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective trends for red pan-fried meat were also borderline statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no other statistically significant or meaningful associations with any of the types of meat cooked by any method and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support the hypothesis that meat consumption is a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
