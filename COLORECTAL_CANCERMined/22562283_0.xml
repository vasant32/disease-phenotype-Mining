<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, despite the importance of hepatic colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (HCM) for the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, no studies have been conducted regarding RKIP expression in HCM tissues or its prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between reduced RKIP expression and HCM and to identify independent predictors for recurrent HCM, which will ultimately help identify patients at high risk of developing metastatic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical study of RKIP expression was performed using primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and/or corresponding HCM tissue samples obtained from 117 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine of these patients did not harbor HCM and 68 harbored HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RKIP expression was reduced in 24.5% (12/49) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> without HCM, 47.1% (32/68) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> with HCM and 67.6% (46/68) of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This distribution of RKIP downregulation was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RKIP expression was found to independently predict recurrent HCM, with a higher relative risk (6.661) compared to that of nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (4.690) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A reduction of RKIP expression in HCM was a significant predictor of poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival of patients with reduced RKIP expression was 35 months, compared with more than 10 years in patients with positive RKIP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that RKIP expression in HCM was an independent predictor of overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 5.161, a value comparable to the risk associated with advanced TNM stage (5.247) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that a reduction of RKIP expression in HCM had an independent predictive value for metastatic recurrence and less favorable clinical outcomes in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly suggest that patients harboring HCM with reduced RKIP expression require careful monitoring after hepatic resection to detect potentially resectable metastatic recurrences </plain></SENT>
