<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to compare the influence of liver microenvironment and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> microenvironment on the behavior of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioned medium (CM) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic fibroblasts (NCFs), CAFs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> (CAF-PT) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CAF-LM) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed functional assays to test the influence of each CM on colorectal cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microarray and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed in DLD1 cells cultured in matched CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In DLD1 cells, CAF-LM CM compared with CAF-PT CM and NCF led to a more aggressive phenotype, induced the features of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition more efficiently, and stimulated migration and invasion to a greater extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sustained stimulation with CAF-LM CM evoked a transient G(2)/M cell cycle arrest accompanied by a reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, inhibition of proliferation, and decreased viability of SW1116, SW620, SW480, DLD1, HT-29, and Caco-2 cells and provoked nonapoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in those cells carrying KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cells resistant to CAF-LM CM completely changed their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in an extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-dependent process and depicted an increased stemness capacity alongside the Wnt pathway stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The transcriptomic profile of DLD1 cells treated with CAF-LM CM was associated with Wnt and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase pathways activation in GSEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the liver microenvironment induces more efficiently the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells than other matched microenvironments do but secondarily evokes cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Resistant cells displayed higher stemness capacity </plain></SENT>
