<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess its safety and efficacy when used as the method of choice for right hemicolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A prospective study was carried out of patients undergoing right hemicolectomy using a single port laparoscopic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were compared with a historical series of patients undergoing right hemicolectomy using a multiport laparoscopic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between December 2009 and September 2010, single port surgery replaced conventional laparoscopic colorectal surgery (LCS) for radical medial to lateral right hemicolectomy performed by a single surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology, length of hospital stay, complications, conversions and readmissions were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients were treated using single port laparoscopic surgery (SPLC): 10 for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (Dukes A1, B6, C3) and four for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were treated using multiport laparoscopic colorectal surgery (LCS): eight for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (Dukes B4, C3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>Carcinoid</z:hpo> 1), three for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and one for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median (interquartile range) operative time for the SPLC group was 120 (90-135) min and for the LCS group was 135 (116-150) min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median (interquartile range) length of hospital stay was 3.5 (2.0-5.0) days for the SPLC group and for the LCS group was 4.0 (3.8-7.0) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median (interquartile range) number of lymph nodes removed for SPLC patients was 14.5 (9.8-19.5) and for the LCS patients was 14.5 (13.0-19.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no conversions, no complications and no readmissions in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data confirm the feasibility of the technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore they suggest that it is safe and efficacious </plain></SENT>
