<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The knowledge on the interrelation between unmet needs and health-related quality of life is scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper studies the hypothesis that patient-perceived unmet needs of rehabilitation during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> trajectory are associated with decreased quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on registers, a Danish population-based cohort of adult, incident, mixed-site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients diagnosed between 1 October 2007 and 30 September 2008 was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 14 months following diagnosis participants completed a questionnaire including health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> (POMS-SF), and unmet needs with regard to physical, emotional, family-oriented, sexual, work-related, and financial problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unmet needs were assessed through six ad hoc questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Questionnaires were received from 3439 of 4947 patients, resulting in a response rate of 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types were breast (28.4%), prostate (14.6%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (15.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 60.1% expressed an unmet need of rehabilitation in at least one area, physical and emotional problems being the most frequent (40.0% and 37.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and POMS, significant adjusted mean differences were observed between patients with unmet needs in at least one area and patients with no unmet needs (p-values &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These differences were well above levels usually considered clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further, impairment increased with increasing number of areas in which unmet needs were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We confirmed the hypothesis that patient-perceived unmet needs of rehabilitation during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> trajectory are associated with decreased quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study supports the use of unmet needs questions to identify patients in need of clinical attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interventions reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients' perceived needs of rehabilitation may enhance quality of life </plain></SENT>
