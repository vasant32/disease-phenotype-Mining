<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) is administered based on standard body surface area (BSA) dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BSA administration results in highly variable exposure, measured as the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An immunoassay (OnDose®; Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) that measures plasma 5-FU concentration and reports an AUC in mg · h/L has been developed to optimize therapy using pharmacokinetic (PK) dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of an analysis to model the 5-FU AUC-dose relationship are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A set of 589 sequential patients from a clinical database receiving 5-FU, leucovorin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (the FOLFOX6 regimen) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) treatment was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subset including only patients who had at least two consecutive cycles tested, received 1,600-3,600 mg/m2 of continuous infusion 5-FU during the initial test cycle, and had a blood sample collected after ��18 hours, was used to conduct regression modeling of the change in AUC versus change in dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A simple regression model with R(2) = 0.51 developed over n = 307 cycle-pair observations characterizes the AUC-Dose relationship as: change in AUC = 0.02063 * dose change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model suggests that dose changes in the range of 145-727 mg/m2 would be sufficient to adjust the AUC to a potential therapeutic threshold of &gt;20 mg · h/L for most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 5-FU is an ideal candidate for PK dose optimization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because individual factors other than dose change may also affect the change in AUC, longitudinal PK monitoring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cycles and dose adjustment to ensure AUC in the desired range of 20-30 mg · h/L are recommended </plain></SENT>
