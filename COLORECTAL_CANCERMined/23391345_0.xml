<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: For centuries <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33968">silver salts</z:chebi> have been used as antimicrobial agents for humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activity of silver <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cations</z:chebi> varies on their bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So delivery methods, solubility and ionization of the silver sources are important parameters to deal metals in biological systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bonding of silver <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cations</z:chebi> to biologically compatible ligands enhances their bioavailability and ultimately the activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, due to significant safety profiles, researchers are now interested to explore their anticancer potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="14434,16069">imidazole</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi>-based compounds have been found to have diverse biological and clinical applications due to being structural isosters of naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>; which allow such compounds to interact easily with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33694">biopolymers</z:chebi> of the living system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This property of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi> constituted compounds has created interest in researchers to further explore their biological applications.The connection of these biologically active moieties (silver &amp; azoles) through Ag-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51369">NHC</z:chebi> bonding provided a biologically enhanced entity that was tested for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells (HCT 116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: N-ipropylbenzimidazole was synthesized by reaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi> with ipropyl <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subsequent treatment of the resulting N-alkylbenzimidazole with ortho/meta/para-(bromomethylene) <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> afforded corresponding bis-benzimidazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromides</z:chebi> (5-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The counter <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="15858">Br-</z:chebi>) of each salt was replaced by hexaflourophosphate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30201">PF6-</z:chebi>) for the ease of handling and further purification (8-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each salt (Ligand), in halide form, was further allowed to react with Ag2O with stirring at room temperature for a period of two days to synthesize dinuclear Ag(I)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51369">NHC</z:chebi> complexes (11-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> synthesized compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques and microanalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="24431">Molecular structures</z:chebi> of compounds 5, 9 &amp; 10 were established through single crystal x-ray diffraction technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the compounds were assessed for their anti-proliferation test on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line (HCT 116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the ligands (5-10) showed mild to negligible cytotoxicity on HCT 116 cells whereas respective silver complexes (11-13) exhibited dose dependent cytotoxicity towards the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with IC50 ranges between 9.7 to 44.5 muM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the complex 13 having para-xylyl spacer was found the most active (IC50 9.7 muM) that verifies our previously reported results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the bis-benzimidazolium salts (8-10) were found inactive whereas after bonding with silver <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cations</z:chebi>, the Ag(I)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51369">NHC</z:chebi> complexes (11-13) showed a dose dependent cytotoxic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This proved that silver practice an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Also, the N-alkyl/aryl substitutions and ortho/metal/para xylyl units regulate the cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Based on the previous and current results it can be concluded that the dinuclear Ag(I)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51369">NHC</z:chebi> complexes are potential anticancer agents and could probably be the potential source of chemotherapeutic drugs </plain></SENT>
