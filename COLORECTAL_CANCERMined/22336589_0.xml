<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate early and late results after multivisceral resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients operated for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 2001 and 2010 were -reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were compared within the patients underwent single organ and multivisceral resections: demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and procedure related parameters, perioperative results, early oncological outcomes and 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 354 patients (59.6 Â± 13.8 years old, 210 [59.3%] males) were abstracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety (25.4%) patients underwent multivisceral resections for clinical T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and en-bloc R0 resection was achieved in 82 (91.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 31 (34.4% and 8.8% of clinical T4 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, respectively) cases had actual adjacent organ invasions (pT4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Males (20%) had lower risk for locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than females (33.3%) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PT4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were more common, if the clinical T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is located in the colon (48.8% vs 21.3%; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopy was seldom initiated and the risk of conversion was higher in clinical T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rates of sphincter-saving procedures were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Operation time, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and transfusion requirements increased when multivisceral resections were necessitated (p &lt; 0.05), but hospital stay, complications and 30-day mortality rates were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rates were identical (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are not rare and more common in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An actual invasion (pT4) may be observed in one third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and more frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An en-bloc, R0, multivisceral resection may be achieved in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Multivisceral resections do not alter the rates of sphincter-saving procedures, morbidity and 30-day mortality; do not worsen survival but increase operation time, intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and perioperative transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
