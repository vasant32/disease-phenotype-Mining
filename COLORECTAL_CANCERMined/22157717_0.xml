<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental data indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells with CD133 expression exhibit enhanced tumorigenicity over CD133-negative (CD133-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that CD133-positive (CD133+) cells, compared with CD133-, are more tumorigenic because they are more interactive with and responsive to their stromal microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Freshly dissected and dissociated cells from a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> were separated into <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and the epithelial cells; the latter were further separated into CD133+ and CD133- cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD133+ cells formed large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice, demonstrating the phenotypic cellular diversity of the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, whereas CD133- cells were unable to sustain significant growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affymetrix gene array analyses using t-test, fold-change and multiple test correction identified candidate genes that were differentially expressed between the CD133+ vs CD133- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR verified differences in expression for 30 of the 46 genes selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genes upregulated (+ vs - cells) included CD133 (9.3-fold) and CXCR4 (4-fold), integrin Î²8 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CAF highly express the respective ligands: stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), vitronectin and FGF family members, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between the CD133+ and CAF cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 caused an increase in intracellular calcium in cells expressing both CD133 and CXCR4, confirming functional CXCR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CD133+/CXCR4+ phenotype is increased to 32% when the cells are grown in suspension compared with only 9% when the cells were allowed to attach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Matrigel 3-D culture, the CD133+/CXCR4+ group treated with SDF-1 grew more colonies compared with vehicle, as well as significantly larger colony sizes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate proof of principle that the enhanced tumorigenic potential of CD133+, compared with CD133-, cells is due to their increased ability to interact with their neighboring CAF </plain></SENT>
