<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To date, no valid imaging modality exists for early response prediction to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in carcinoembryonic-antigen-(CEA)-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> (UICC stages II and III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that the uptake of an anti-CEA antibody is directly related to the number of viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and may be quantified by immuno-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (immuno-PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated a novel pretargeting system using TF2, a humanized bispecific trivalent monoclonal antibody (mAb), directed against CEA and the <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-288-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, a hapten for binding radiometals for imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uptake and kinetics of the pretargeting system were investigated in vitro prior to and after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TF2 was labeled with ¹³¹I and <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-288 with ¹¹¹InCl₃ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines HT29, SW480, and T84 with known varying CEA expression were incubated (≤ 72 hours) with ¹³¹I-TF2 or the TF2-¹¹¹In-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-288 pretargeting system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parallel cultures were irradiated with 2-10 Gy high-energy <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tracer uptake, proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and CEA-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The uptake of tracers was dependent on CEA expression and cell count of the cell lines (uptake/10⁶ cells: 0.3% in HT29, 1.5% in SW480, and 14% in T84, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TF2-¹¹¹In-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-288 pretargeting system showed a higher uptake after 4 and 72 hours compared to (131)I-TF2 in parallel cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only in one cell line (SW480) an <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> after irradiation could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Irradiation increased dose dependently both the specific uptake of ¹³¹I-TF2 and of the TF2-¹¹¹In-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-288 system (4-fold in HT29 and T84 after 10 Gy (72 hours), p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results were CEA-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This novel pretargeting system allows the quantitative analysis of CEA-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and represents a promising tool for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell viability after irradiation </plain></SENT>
