<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen consecutive patients with unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, after the failure of two lines of systemic chemotherapy, were treated with HAI raltitrexed (3 mg/m over 1 h) followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (130 mg/m over 2 h) every 3 weeks between January 2006 and January 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> limited to the liver and had failed at least two lines of chemotherapy, which contained <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, irinotecan and a fluoropyrimidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median number of cycles was six (range 1-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed three complete responses and eight partial responses among assessable patients (overall response rate in intention to treat, 65%; 95% confidence interval, 44.3-87.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time to progression was 10.5 months and the median survival time was 27.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toxicity included grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (in 17%), grade 3-4 <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp> (in 17%), and grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (in 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the combination regimen of HAI raltitrexed and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> is feasible and promising in patients who presented isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after failure of irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
