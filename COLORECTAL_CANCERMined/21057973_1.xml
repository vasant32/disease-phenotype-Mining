<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of bevacizumab combined with FOLFIRI-3 in mCRC after failure of prior chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were treated with bevacizumab in combination with FOLFIRI-3 every 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between treatment efficacy and visceral fat area as measured by CT scan or Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) change after 2 months was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-nine consecutive patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and twenty four cycles of chemotherapy were delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (22.4%) had an objective partial response and 26 (53.1%) were stabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7 and 13 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four grade 4 adverse events occurred (1 digestive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, 1 rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, and 1 febrile <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>) but no toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 18 patients (38%) including asthenia in 15 patients (30%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> in 4 patients (8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in 11 patients (22%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in 4 patients (8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 10 patients (20%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp> in 4 patients (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Visceral Fat area was significantly lower in responder patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CEA change at 2 months predicted improved overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that bevacizumab combined with FOLFIRI3 may be active in mCRC patients after failure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classical lines of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
