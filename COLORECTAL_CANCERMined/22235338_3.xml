<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a newly identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor that is frequently downregulated in a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous work revealed that the low expression of CHD5 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is correlated with CHD5 promoter CpG island hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of microRNA-211 (miR-211)-regulated CHD5 expression on colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: miR-211 was predicted to target CHD5 by TargetScan software analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A stably expressing exogenous miR-211 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell line (HCT-116(miR-211)) was generated using lentiviral transduction and used as a model for in vitro and in vivo studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression level of miR-211 in HCT-116(miR-211) cells was upregulated by 16-fold compared to vector control cells (HCT-116(vector)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exogenous miR-211 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of CHD5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, resulting in a 50% decrease in CHD5 protein level in HCT-116(miR-211) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of cell proliferation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, and cell migration of HCT-116(miR-211) cells were significantly higher than HCT-116(vector) cells under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, as determined using the methods of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, colony formation, flow cytometry, scratch assay, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that enforced expression of miR-211 in HCT-116 cells was able to alter p53 pathway-associated regulatory proteins, such as MDM2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that CHD5 is a direct target of miR-211 regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enforced expression of miR-211 promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell growth at least in part by downregulating the expression level of the CHD5 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a better understanding of the association of between miR-211-regulated CHD5 expression and CHD5 function in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
