<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> translocation or anastomic leakage during resection has been shown to correlate with a poor long-term surgical outcome, suggesting that <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> products may contribute to the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Driven by these premises, we investigated the role of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> product <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) in the generation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal injection of LPS led to enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to the rat liver as early as 1.5 h post-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a rapid loss of the expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) was observed, suggesting that LPS disrupts the integrity of the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LPS addition to endothelial-macrophage co-cultures damaged endothelial monolayers and caused the formation of intercellular gaps, which was accompanied by increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that macrophages are involved in the endothelial damage resulting from exposure to LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression levels of of ZO-1 were not affected by LPS treatment in rats in which liver macrophages had been depleted as well as in rats that had been treated with a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both settings, decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings indicate that LPS induces ROS release by macrophages, resulting in the damage of the vascular lining of the liver and hence allowing increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, peri-operative treatments that prevent the activation of macrophages and-as a consequence-limit endothelial damage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> may significantly improve the long-term outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients undergoing surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
