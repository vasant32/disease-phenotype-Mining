<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Several screening methods have been applied for the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients are not diagnosed at a localized stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to find novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, profiling of the serum levels of fatty acids, which are the main components of fats and are important factors for human metabolism, was performed using the sera of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: A total of 42 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and eight healthy volunteers participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of fatty acids, including free fatty acids and esterified fatty acids, were evaluated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed on the basis of the serum fatty acids detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum levels of the nine fatty acids exhibited distinct differences between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and healthy volunteers: the levels of four fatty acids were higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients than the healthy volunteers, and those of the other five fatty acids were lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes were also observed at a very early clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27283">very-long-chain fatty acids</z:chebi> had a tendency to be increased in the sera of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> leads to changes in the composition of serum fatty acids including free fatty acids and esterified fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that serum fatty acid profiling may be used as a novel diagnostic tool for early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
