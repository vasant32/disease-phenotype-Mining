<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Family history is one of the most important risk factors for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), and medical organizations recommend <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is still low in our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening tests, and factors related to screening in a family-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 334 family-risk participants answered a questionnaire to assess the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests, knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, risk perception, and barriers against screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 22% of participants had undergone at least one of the recommended tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, indication for screening was found in only 8% of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests was significantly lower than mammography for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> detection in women (20 vs. 82%, P&lt;0.001) and use of serum prostate-specific antigen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> detection in men (27 vs. 46%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most participants (59%) knew that being elderly was a risk factor and only about half (47%) had knowledge about any of the recommended examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only in about half of the cases (47%) was subjective risk perception higher than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the logistic regression analysis, having more than one affected relative (odds ratio= 2.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-6.68; P=0.03) and a high subjective perception of risk (odds ratio= 2.87, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-7.46; P=0.03) were independent predictors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Less than 25% of the family-risk population has undergone a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Family history and subjective risk perception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are the strongest predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
