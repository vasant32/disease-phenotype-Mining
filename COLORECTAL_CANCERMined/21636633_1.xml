<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with 6 months' follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: German statutory health insurance scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 1577 insured people who were members of the target group for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (age 50-75, no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Brochure with evidence based risk information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and two optional interactive internet modules on risk and diagnostic tests; official information leaflet of the German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programme (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary end point was "informed choice," comprising "knowledge," "attitude," and "combination of actual and planned uptake." Secondary outcomes were "knowledge" and "combination of actual and planned uptake." Knowledge and attitude were assessed after 6 weeks and combination of actual and planned uptake of screening after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate for return of both questionnaires was 92.4% (n = 1457) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>345/785 (44.0%) participants in the intervention group made an informed choice, compared with 101/792 (12.8%) in the control group (difference 31.2%, 99% confidence interval 25.7% to 36.7%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More intervention group participants had "good knowledge" (59.6% (n = 468) v 16.2% (128); difference 43.5%, 37.8% to 49.1%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A "positive attitude" towards colorectal screening prevailed in both groups but was significantly lower in the intervention group (93.4% (733) v 96.5% (764); difference -3.1%, -5.9% to -0.3%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intervention had no effect on the combination of actual and planned uptake (72.4% (568) v 72.9% (577); P = 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Evidence based risk information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening increased informed choices and improved knowledge, with little change in attitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The intervention did not affect the combination of actual and planned uptake of screening </plain></SENT>
