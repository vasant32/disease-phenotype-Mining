<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Outcomes of consecutive liver resections for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> involving the caudate lobe between 1996 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively, and compared with those after liver surgery without caudate resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients underwent caudate and 432 non-caudate liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Caudate resection was commonly performed as part of extended resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in operative complications (24 versus 21·1 per cent; P = 0·727) or blood loss (median 300 versus 250 ml; P = 0·234) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operating time was longer for caudate resection (median 283 versus 227 min; P = 0·024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> size was larger in the caudate group (median 40 versus 27 mm; P = 0·018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resection margins were smaller when the caudate lobe was involved by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, than in resections including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-free caudate or non-caudate resection; however, there was no difference in the proportion of completely excised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> between caudate and non-caudate resections (96 versus 96·1 per cent; P = 0·990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-year overall survival rates were 90 and 89·3 per cent respectively (P = 0·960), with 1-year recurrence-free survival rates of 62 and 71·2 per cent (P = 0·340) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Caudate lobe surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> does not increase the incidence of resection margin involvement, although when the caudate lobe contains <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> the margins are significantly closer than in other resections </plain></SENT>
