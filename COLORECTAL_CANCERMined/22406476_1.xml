<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> cells have defects in signaling via the mechanistic target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR), which regulates proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether aspirin affects <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effects of aspirin on mTOR signaling, the ribosomal protein S6, S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) were examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of AMPK was measured; the effects of loss of AMPKα on the aspirin-induced effects of mTOR were determined using small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and in AMPK(α1/α2-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LC3 and ULK1 were used as markers of autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed rectal mucosa samples from patients given 600 mg aspirin, once daily for 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aspirin reduced mTOR signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells by inhibiting the mTOR effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aspirin changed nucleotide ratios and activated AMPK in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>mTOR was still inhibited by aspirin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells after siRNA knockdown of AMPKα, indicating AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms of aspirin-induced inhibition of mTOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aspirin induced autophagy, a feature of mTOR inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (an activator of AMPK) increased inhibition of mTOR and Akt, as well as autophagy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rectal mucosal samples from patients given aspirin had reduced phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin is an inhibitor of mTOR and an activator of AMPK, targeting regulators of intracellular energy homeostasis and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These could contribute to its protective effects against development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
