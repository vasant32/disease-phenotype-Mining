<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of markers of resistance to fluorouracil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> has recently been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We revised the outcomes of metastatic MA of the colon treated with FOLFOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From January 2002 to December 2009, we treated 198 patients with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, of which 21 (10.6%) had diagnosis of MA and were compared with 42 control patients with non-mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (NMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In MA group, three patients [14%; inhibitory concentration 95: ± 7.5%] reached partial response, and in NMA group, two patients obtained complete response and 16 obtained partial response with an overall response rate of 43% (inhibitory concentration 95: ± 7.6%) with a significant statistical difference (P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival for MA group was 4 months with respect to 8 months for NMA (P = 0.0001); regarding overall survival, we registered a median of 8 months with respect to 18 months for MA and NMA (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, MA histology, Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status 2, more than two metastatic sites, and peritoneal metastatic involvement resulted in negative independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also in our study, MA is connected to poor prognosis and reduced activity of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the absence of randomised studies, it may be convenient to analyse this subgroup of patients within the large trials carried out on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
