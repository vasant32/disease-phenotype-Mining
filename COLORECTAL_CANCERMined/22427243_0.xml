<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Europe, PCa is the most common solid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, with an incidence rate of 214 cases per 1000 men, outnumbering lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the EAU guidelines, the main diagnostic tools to obtain evidence of PCa include DRE, serum concentration of PSA and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>But, does TRUS affect the diagnostic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between March 2007 and March 2011 we performed 441 prostate biopsies to compare the results with clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic features of every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value and likelihood ratio about every diagnostic tool (PSA, DRE and TRUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The transrectal ultrasonography has a low diagnostic accuracy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> because it shows: Low sensitivity and specificity (higher incidence of false positives than true positives); Variability of ultrasound situations within which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion TRUS may be considered only a complement to PSA and DRE </plain></SENT>
