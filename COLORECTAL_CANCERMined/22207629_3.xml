<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is indirect evidence that T cell responses can control the metastatic spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an enrichment of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) has also been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> promotes Treg activity and how this influences anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> immune responses and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A longitudinal study of Treg activity on a cohort of patients was performed before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific CD4(+) T cell responses were also measured to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> associated antigens carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 5T4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tregs from 62 preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients expressed a highly significant increase in levels of Foxp3 compared to healthy age-matched controls (p=0.007), which returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after surgery (p=0.0075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD4(+) T cell responses to one or both of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> associated antigens, CEA and 5T4, were observed in approximately two-thirds of patients and one third of these responses were suppressed by Tregs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> recurrence at 12 months, significant preoperative suppression was observed of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific (p=0.003) but not control CD4(+) T cell responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> drives the activity of Tregs and accompanying suppression of CD4(+) T cell responses to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Suppression is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrence of tumour</z:e> at 12 months, implying that Tregs contribute to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings offer a rationale for the manipulation of Tregs for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
