<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One-third of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> occur in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> involves surgery with/without radiotherapy and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgery is undertaken to prevent damage to the nerves controlling bladder, bowel, and sexual organs, whether this translates into preservation of urinary and fecal continence and sexual function and, ultimately, quality of life (QoL) is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this review was to summarize the literature regarding the impact of treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> on bladder and bowel continence, sexual function and QoL in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A comprehensive review of the current literature on sexual function, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> and wellbeing in women after treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> highlighting prevalence rates, trial design, and patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature using A systematic search of the literature using Medline (Ovid, 1946-present) and PubMed (1966-2011) for English-language studies that included the following search terms: "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>," or "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>," or "rectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>," and "sexual function," or "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e>," or "wellbeing," or "QoL," or "urinary or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002607'>fecal incontinence</z:hpo>." RESULTS: Although around 1/3 of women aged 50 to 70 years report lack of sexual desire, sexual function problems after treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> are in the order of 60% among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QoL improves with length of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urinary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002607'>fecal incontinence</z:hpo> are ongoing concerns for many women after treatment with rates up to 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a gap in our knowledge of the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and its treatment on urinary and fecal continence, sexual function and QoL in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is a need for studies of sufficient size and duration to gain a better understanding of the disease and its management and the long-term effects on these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This information is needed to develop preventative health care plans for women treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> that target those most at risk for these adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
