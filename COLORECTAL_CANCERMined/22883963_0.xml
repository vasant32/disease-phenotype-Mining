<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since 2002, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> Emission Tomography (PET-CT) has been considered to be an essential pre-operative investigation in the management of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to compare characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> on PET-CT with post-operative histological findings and pathology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with CRLM, who underwent surgical intervention from 2002 to 2008, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET-CT and pathology reports of hepatic resections and original colorectal resections were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, colorectal staging, number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and their maximum diameter from both PET-CT and pathology reports were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Values were expressed as mean (±SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 141 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum diameter on PET-CT (4.2 ± 2.6) was similar to pathology (4.8 ± 3.6; p = 0.39), with significant correlation (r = 0.72, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of lesions on PET-CT (1.6 ± 1.0) was similar to pathology (1.7 ± 1.3; p = 0.43) with significant correlation (r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean SUV max was 9.22 (±4.39), with no correlation to lesion diameter (r = 0.25, p = 0.045), but significantly increased with decreasing differentiation (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PET-CT scanning accurately detected the number of lesions and their maximum diameter, with radiological evidence of poorer differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies of non-surgical patients are required to assess its overall accuracy </plain></SENT>
