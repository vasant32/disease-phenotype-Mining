<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 422 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who received 5-FU-based chemotherapy were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) levels were determined before each cycle of chemotherapy during active treatment and regular follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and characteristics of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> were investigated, with special focus on the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 422 CRC patients, 60 had pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 362 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FPG levels before chemotherapy, 42 (11.6%) and 41 (11.3%) patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 42 secondary diabetic patients, 22 (52.4%) received anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> drug therapy, in 7 (16.7%) cases the FPG level returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> without any active intervention, and 13 (30.9%) cases received diet control and physiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one (8.6%) patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, an adverse event over Grade 3 occurred in seven cases during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>-related adverse events had a serious negative impact on chemotherapy in six cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> associated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy occurs in around 10% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, with a significant negative impact on treatment and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>5-FU-related <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should be regarded as a common side effect of 5-FU treatment </plain></SENT>
