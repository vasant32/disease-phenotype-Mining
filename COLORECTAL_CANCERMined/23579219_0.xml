<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, biological correlations were examined for the candidate SNPs in terms of their regulatory pathway.Results:For cetuximab regimens, patients homozygous for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles (GG) of LIFR rs3729740 exhibited a 1.9 times greater overall response rate (ORR) and 1.4 months longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those homozygous or heterozygous for the mutant allele (GA and AA; P=0.022 and 0.027, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For bevacizumab regimens, patients homozygous for the minor alleles (TT) of ANXA11 rs1049550 exhibited an ORR twice as high as those homozygous or heterozygous for the ancestral allele (CC and CT; P=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate gain was achieved up to 10% in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LIFR rs3729740 patients either with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> (P=0.001) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically in clones treated with cetuximab and bevacizumab regimens, active p-ERK and MMP-9 expressions were significantly reduced in clones expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LIFR rs3729740 (P=0.044) and in those expressing minor-type ANXA11 rs1049550 (P=0.007), respectively.Conclusion:LIFR rs3729740 and possibly ANXA11 rs1049550 may be useful as biomarkers for predicting whether mCRC patients are sensitive to relevant target regimens, although further validation in large cohorts is needed.British Journal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> advance online publication, 11 April 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.163 www.bjcancer.com </plain></SENT>
