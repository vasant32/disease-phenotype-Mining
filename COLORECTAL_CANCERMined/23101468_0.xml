<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients has resulted in better five-year survival for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared excess mortality rates in various time intervals after surgery in patients with colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Material and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> reported in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry of Norway before (1994-1996) and after (2001-2003) national treatment guidelines were introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excess mortality was analysed in different postoperative time intervals within the five-year follow-up periods for patients treated in 1994-1996 vs. 2001-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 437 patients that underwent curative resection were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients treated from 1994 to 1996, excess mortality was similar in colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For those treated from 2001 to 2003, excess mortality was significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients perioperatively (in the first 60 days: excess mortality ratio = 0.46, p = 0.007) and during the first two postoperative years (2-12 months: excess mortality ratio = 0.54, p = 0.010; 1-2 years: excess mortality ratio = 0.60, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Excess mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients was significantly greater than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients 4-5 years postoperatively (excess mortality ratio = 2.18, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Excess mortality for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> changed substantially after the introduction of national treatment guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Short-term excess mortality rates was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> for patients treated in 2001-2003, while excess mortality rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients was significantly higher later in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This suggests that future research should focus on these differences of excess mortality in patients curatively treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the colon</z:e> and rectum </plain></SENT>
