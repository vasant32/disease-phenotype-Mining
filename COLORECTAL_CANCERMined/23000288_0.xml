<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level is suggested to be negatively correlated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA), but most of the epidemiological data were originated amongst Caucasians and African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the relationship between <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status, smoking and CRA in an ethnically diverse community with a high Hispanic density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 233 patients who underwent complete colonoscopies from 2009 to 2011, and their serum 25OHD levels in the winter season had been measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 65 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cases and 168 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-free controls were identified and evaluated for the association of CRA with smoking, ethnicity and serum 25OHD level using unstratified and stratified multivariate logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our study participants, the mean serum 25OHD level and the percentage of Hispanics were lower in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> group versus the control group, while no black-white difference was noted in the CRA prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for 25OHD level, the lower rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics was attenuated and became statistically insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mild protective effect of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> (6% reduction) on the CRA risk was found significant for active smokers, but not for non-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A detrimental impact of smoking in the CRA risk was only shown among non-Hispanic patients, but not among Hispanics irrespective of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a marked distinction between Hispanics and non-Hispanics in the risk of CRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> prevalence among Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics could be partially explained by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status, cigarette smoking and their interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future larger-sized multi-center studies on <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status and ethnicity, as well as dietary, behavioral, genetic factors and their interactions for CRA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are needed </plain></SENT>
