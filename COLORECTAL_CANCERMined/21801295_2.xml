<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: An electronic database was used to identify patients over 80 years who underwent laparoscopic bowel resection between December 2000 and October 2009 at three UK laparoscopic colorectal training units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who required abdominoperineal excision of the rectum were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 173 patients (80 men) of median age 84 (80-93) years were identified </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median body mass index was 26 (14-45) kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (7.5%) patients were converted to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The major causes for conversion were <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms that laparoscopic large bowel resection is safe and beneficial in a population over 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It has low morbidity and mortality and a shortened hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Octogenarians should not be denied major laparoscopic bowel surgery based on age alone </plain></SENT>
