<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: When hepatectomy is used as a primary treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (CRCLM), the balance between surgical curability and functional preservation of the remnant liver is of great importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 108 patients who underwent initial hepatectomy for CRCLM were retrospectively analyzed with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extent, operative method, and prognosis, including recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates (OS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were 90.5%, 77.8%, 63.2%, and 51.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level after hepatectomy (&lt;36 or ≥36 mAU/mL) and presence of recurrence as independent prognostic factors of OS (P = 0.0458 and 0.0249, respectively), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (&lt;se (a2) vs. ≥se (a2)) and serum CA 19-9 level after hepatectomy as the significant factors affecting disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.0025 and 0.00138, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither resection margin nor type of hepatectomy (anatomic or nonanatomic) for CRCLM was a significant prognostic factor for OS or DFS or CRCLM recurrence, including intrahepatic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In CRCLM, we believe that nonanatomic hepatectomy with narrow margin is indicated, and optimal treatment would include functional preservation of as much of the remnant liver as possible </plain></SENT>
