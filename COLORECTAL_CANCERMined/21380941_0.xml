<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electronic medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women diagnosed at our institution with EC predominantly between 1997 and 2007 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed age at diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, and findings at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and recorded the information in a database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated for the Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-seven women with EC were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median age was 66; 39% were less than age 60 at diagnosis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the women, 142 (53.2%) did not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of the women screened, ten had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> with one of those <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> being greater than 1 cm, four had tubulovillous histology, and three had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was performed in 59.2% of women who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
