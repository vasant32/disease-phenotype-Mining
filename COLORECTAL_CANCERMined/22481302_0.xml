<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the data on age- and sex-specific incidence rates and relative risks associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We carried out this population-based cohort study to investigate the overall sex- and age-specific risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in association with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients (n = 615,532) and age- and sex-matched control individuals (n = 614,871), selected from the claim datasets, were followed up from 2000 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rates of admission due to colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancers</z:e> were estimated using the person-years approach, and the age- and sex-specific hazard ratio (HR) for both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were determined using the Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was 9.94 per 10,000 patient-years for the diabetic patients, as opposed to 7.84 per 10,000 patient-years for the control-group patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding observation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> was 7.16 and 6.28 per 10,000 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients aged ≥ 45 years had significantly high HRs for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (1.20-1.45-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also noted a significantly high HR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in diabetic men (1.18-fold) aged ≥ 45 years, but not in diabetic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may significantly increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially in patients aged 45-64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diabetologists should keep this relationship in mind while treating middle-aged diabetic men and should also advise these patients to undergo regular screening tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
