<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chromosome locus of APC, 5q21-22, is frequently deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large amount of clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case-matched tissues of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium (n = 134) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative PCR was carried out to examine the copy number as well as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of APC gene in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that copy number deletions of APC were present in a relatively high percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples (26.1%, 35 out of 134) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between copy number decrease of APC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, copy number loss of APC was correlated with decreased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of APC were also impaired in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples with unaltered copy numbers, indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> exhibit different mechanisms of APC regulation </plain></SENT>
