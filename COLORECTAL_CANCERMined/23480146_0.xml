<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from a randomized phase III study comparing infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> plus irinotecan (FUFIRI) vs. irinotecan plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (mIROX) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient groups were analyzed according to the relative change in maximum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter between baseline and after 7 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ETS cohort was defined as a decrease of ≥20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the non-ETS cohort was subdivided into "minor shrinkage" (19-0%), "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>" (any increase) and development of "new metastatic lesions" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PFS and OS were estimated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assessment of ETS was possible in 201 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ETS was observed in 47% (94/201) and non-ETS in 53% (107/201) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with ETS had a more favorable outcome with regard to PFS (9.9 months vs. 6.1 months, p=0.029) and OS (27.5 months vs. 17.8 months, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the non-ETS subgroups, patients with "minor shrinkage" (PFS 8.4 months, OS 21.6 months) showed a markedly better outcome than patients with "early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>" (PFS 4.0 months, OS 15.3 months) or with "new metastatic lesions (PFS 2.2 months, OS 7.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ETS assessment offers accelerated response evaluation when compared to RECIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients treated with chemotherapy alone, ETS ≥20% is associated with excellent outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-ETS is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> subgroup where patients with minor shrinkage clearly benefit from treatment, and patients with early progression or development of new lesions have an unfavorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
