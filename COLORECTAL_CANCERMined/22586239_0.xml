<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 311 patients were included in the study; 228 referrals (73.3%) were considered appropriate and clinically significant pathology was found in 157 patients, giving an overall diagnostic yield of 50.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic yield in those with appropriate referrals was 58.8% and 27.7% (P = 0.004) in those with inappropriate referrals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our setting these guidelines are useful in improving diagnostic yield and reducing the rate of inappropriate referrals for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, patients above the age of 50 presenting with lower gastrointestinal symptoms should undergo a colonoscopy even if the indication was inappropriate, especially in countries which are not implementing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programmes for average risk patients </plain></SENT>
