<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies have evaluated offline interpretation of pCLE images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, real-time interpretation is necessary to assist decision-making during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this pilot study was to compare the accuracy of real-time pCLE diagnosis made during the procedure with that of blinded offline interpretation to provide accuracy estimates that will aid the planning of future studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: pCLE was performed in patients undergoing screening and surveillance colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> had been identified, one endoscopist analyzed pCLE images during the procedure and made a provisional "real-time" diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saved video recordings were de-identified, randomized, and reviewed "offline" 1 month later by the same endoscopist, who was blinded to the original diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Images from a total of 154 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were recorded (80 neoplastic, 74 non-neoplastic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy of real-time pCLE diagnosis (accuracy 79%, sensitivity 81%, specificity 76%) and offline pCLE diagnosis (83%, 88%, and 77%, respectively) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 154 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> &lt; 10 mm in size, the accuracy of real-time interpretation was significantly lower (accuracy 78%, sensitivity 71%, specificity 83%) than that of offline pCLE interpretation (81%, 86%, 78%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> â‰¥ 10 mm, the accuracy of pCLE diagnosis in real-time was better (accuracy 85%, sensitivity 90%, specificity 75%) than offline pCLE diagnosis (81%, 97%, and 50%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that real-time and offline interpretations of pCLE images are moderately accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Real-time interpretation is slightly less accurate than offline diagnosis, but overall both are comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there was contrasting accuracy between the two methods for small and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
