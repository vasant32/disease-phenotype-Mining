<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this is to determine factors associated with treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Patients who underwent SHP-N after a positive prognostic block were identified based on diagnostic classification and procedural codes from databases at 2 large teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A host of demographic, clinical, and treatment factors were examined for their association with treatment success, which was defined as ≥50% pain relief lasting ≥1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: A total of 53.1% of 32 patients with sufficient medical records for analysis experienced a positive outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with a positive outcome were older (mean age 59.6 y, SD 13.1 vs. 47.8, SD 15.6; P=0.03), less likely to have pelvic pain (36.8% success rate, P=0.04), and more likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> (88.9% success rate; P=0.01) than those with a negative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In stratified analysis, female were more likely to have positive outcome if they did not have pelvic pain compared to those that did (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference was not significant for males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION:: Selecting patients based on demographic and clinical variables may improve treatment outcomes for SHP-N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Larger, prospective studies are needed to confirm our results and better refine selection criteria better </plain></SENT>
