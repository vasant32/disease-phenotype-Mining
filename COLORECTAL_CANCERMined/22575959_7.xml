<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the biological and therapeutic significance, the molecular mechanism of R-spondin action remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the cell-surface transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) and its homologue ring finger 43 (RNF43) are negative feedback regulators of Wnt signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ZNRF3 is associated with the Wnt receptor complex, and inhibits Wnt signalling by promoting the turnover of frizzled and LRP6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of ZNRF3 enhances Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling and disrupts Wnt/planar cell polarity signalling in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, R-spondin mimics ZNRF3 inhibition by increasing the membrane level of Wnt receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, R-spondin interacts with the extracellular domain of ZNRF3 and induces the association between ZNRF3 and LGR4, which results in membrane clearance of ZNRF3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that R-spondin enhances Wnt signalling by inhibiting ZNRF3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study provides new mechanistic insights into the regulation of Wnt receptor turnover, and reveals ZNRF3 as a tractable target for therapeutic exploration </plain></SENT>
