<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> requiring colorectal resection were randomized into fast-track group (n = 35) and conventional care group (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical parameters and markers of humeral immune function were evaluated in both groups postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two patients finally completed the study, including 32 in the fast-track group and 30 in the conventional care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly faster recovery of postoperative humoral immunity: blood levels of globulin (24.1 ± 2.4 vs 22.1 ± 3.3 g/L, P = 0.025), immunoglobulin G (10.79 ± 2.39 vs 8.66 ± 2.09 g/L, P = 0.007) and complement 4 (0.24 ± 0.09 vs 0.17 ± 0.05 g/L, P = 0.035) at Day 3 postoperation were higher in the fast-track group than in the conventional care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>And there was also a significantly shorter length of postoperative stay (6.0 ± 1.0 vs 11.7 ± 3.8 d, P &lt; 0.001) in patients undergoing fast-track rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fast-track surgery accelerates the recovery of postoperative humoral immune function in elective surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with a shorter length of postoperative hospital stay </plain></SENT>
