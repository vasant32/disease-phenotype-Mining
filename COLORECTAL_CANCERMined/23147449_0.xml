<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether a modified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> (mGPS) could predict survival in patients undergoing multimodality therapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 245 patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mGPS was recorded prior to first-line chemotherapy and to cytoreductive therapy including secondary surgery and/or radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of the mGPS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier, univariate, and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients who received chemotherapy alone (n = 163), the mGPS prior to chemotherapy was an independent prognostic indicator of survival [odds ratio (OR) 1.858; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.213-2.846; p = 0.0044] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients who also underwent cytoreductive therapy (n = 82), the mGPS decreased after chemotherapy in 22 patients (27%) and increased in 5 (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, the mGPS prior to cytoreductive therapy was an independent prognostic indicator of survival (OR 3.412; 95% CI 1.198-9.720; p = 0.0216), but the mGPS prior to chemotherapy was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mGPS is an independent prognostic indicator of survival in patients undergoing multimodality therapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, if recorded at a relevant time point </plain></SENT>
