<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: To assess by prospective randomized controlled trial the feasibility and efficacy of using a bioresorbable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">hyaluronic acid</z:chebi>/carboxymethylcellulose membrane (HA membrane) to prevent abdominal and perihepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients requiring 2-stage hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Two-stage hepatectomy offers the possibility of long-term survival to selected patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> cannot be removed in a single procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the second operation is made more difficult by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> arising from the first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HA membrane reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> in gynecologic and abdominal surgery but this is the first trial in hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Fifty-four candidates for 2-stage hepatectomy were randomized at the end of the first procedure to implantation of HA membrane (n = 41) or standard management (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients from the membrane arm and 11 well-matched controls underwent the planned second hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Positioning of the HA membranes was feasible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient and did not increase complications associated with the first hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At second hepatectomy, patients in the HA membrane arm required 33% less time than controls to achieve complete liver mobilization (median: 50 vs 75 minutes; primary endpoint) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> was reduced in the HA membrane group (31% had grade 3-4 adhesions vs 55% in controls), as was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> severity (17% thick and hypervascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> vs 46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with complications at second hepatectomy was higher in the control group (55% vs 23% in the HA membrane group, P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: Use of 4 HA membranes at the end of first hepatectomy reduced the extent and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> and facilitated the second hepatectomy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> who required a 2-stage hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A larger study to confirm these findings is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(NCT01262417) </plain></SENT>
