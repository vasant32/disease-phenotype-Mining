<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has recently been applied in the treatment of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, indications for emergent surgery and criteria for conservative treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the criteria for non-surgical treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> during colorectal ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 219 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in 215 patients (136 men and 79 women; median age 69 years) were removed by performing ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedural outcomes, complications, prognoses, and criteria for non-surgical treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> were retrospectively analyzed by using our prospectively corrected database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The en-bloc and complete en-bloc resection rates were 92.7% (203/219) and 85.8% (188/219), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of discontinued ESD was 2.3% (5/219) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immediate and delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rates were 5.0% (11/219) and 0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of these patients required emergent surgery because of a residual lesion and localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> caused by an unsuccessful closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other 10 patients recovered with conservative treatment after successful closure with hemoclips and complete resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The defects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were successfully closed by using hemoclips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had signs of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The other factors, i.e. absence of localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo>, high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and acceleration of inflammatory reaction, were not associated with the success or the failure of the non-surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The criteria for non-surgical treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> caused by colonic ESD were absence of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> and successful closure </plain></SENT>
