<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the possibility to have an assay useful to measure the drug sensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells has a great importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of cytotoxicity assays are currently available, each of them using a specific approach to detect different aspects of cell viability, such as cell integrity, proliferation and metabolic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to compare, under identical experimental conditions, three common cytotoxicity assays (ATP-lite, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and CCK-8 assays) in the assessment of the anti-proliferative effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (OHP) on three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines (WiDr, SW620 and HT-29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding 5-FU, the three assays were found to be significantly correlated with a moderate or high correlation coefficient, whereas in the case of OHP we found different outcomes among the assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that the CCK-8 is the most sensitive assay for detecting changes of cell viability, suggesting that the viability measured in cells after drug exposure depends on several parameters like the drug used, the biological characteristics of the target cell and the specific approach employed by the method to detect distinct cell growth and metabolic functions </plain></SENT>
