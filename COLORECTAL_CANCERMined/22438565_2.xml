<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is one of the deadliest diseases in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To predict the outcome of therapy, we assessed the role of class III (TUBB3) and class V Î²-tubulin (TUBB6) as predictive biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using immunohistochemistry and nanofluidics, the expression of TUBB3 and TUBB6 was assessed in two cohorts of 180 and 134 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CYP17A1 RS743572 was genotyped to identify GG carriers with enhanced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TUBB3 and TUBB6 were investigated in 22 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines in basal conditions and after serum starvation, the latter serving as activator of this prosurvival pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To ascertain the role of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (AR) in such regulation, we silenced AR and checked TUBB3 and TUBB6 expression and sensitivity to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a link between poor survival, the expression of TUBB3/TUBB6, and AR only in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, only in males carriers of the GG phenotype exhibited the worst outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, male cell lines were resistant to serum starvation and exhibited higher levels of TUBB6, thereby suggesting that the pathway is activated by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In female cells this phenomenon was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In both genders, AR was the main driver of TUBB3/TUBB6 expression, as constitutive silencing of AR was associated with downregulation of TUBB3/TUBB6 expression and increased sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and SN-38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in the TUBB3 pathway opens the way for clinical trials to assess the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35497">antiandrogens</z:chebi> for increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy in male <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
