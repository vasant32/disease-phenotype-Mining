<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the CTNNA1 and the CTNNB1 mutations and its relationship to clinical and pathological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in Polish patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CTNNA1 gene alteration in exon 7 were detected in 4 samples and in exon 3 of CTNNB1 gene were found in 3 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend at the limit of statistical significance associating younger age at diagnosis (&lt;50) with CTNNA1 and the CTNNB1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutation of CTNNB1 seemed to occur more frequently in the proximal colon than distal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with CTNNA1 mutation had a significantly increased lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was no correlation between mutations and the other clinical variables (e.g. sex, grade and depth of invasion) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although we found a low frequency of mutations in the CTNNA1 and the CTNNB1 genes, but the analysis the relationship with clinical and pathological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients may indicated an association of these mutations with the risk and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
