<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Distress may be heightened among members of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patient-caregiver dyads that are mismatched on smoking status (either the patient or caregiver smokes, but the other does not), negatively affecting quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine associations between patient-caregiver smoking concordance, caregiver psychological adjustment, and caregiver and patient mental and physical QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lung and colorectal patient-caregiver dyads (N = 742) were identified from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) and CanCORS Caregiver studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were male (67.0%) with local (45.6%) or regional (12.9%) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of the informal caregivers were females (78.6%), under 65 years of age (69.6%), and often spouses (57.8%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> caregivers, who were members of dyads where one or both members continued to smoke, reported worse mental health QoL than nonsmoking dyads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, continuing to smoke when the caregiver did not was associated with worse mental health QoL compared with nonsmoking dyads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dyad smoking was less strongly associated with physical QoL for both caregivers and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results highlight the importance of assessing smoking in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and their caregivers and referring families to appropriate psychosocial and smoking cessation services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: This is the first study to show associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patient-caregiver smoking status and QoL for both dyad members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies will need to confirm these associations longitudinally and investigate potential mechanisms linking dyad smoking and QoL </plain></SENT>
