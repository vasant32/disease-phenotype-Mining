<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently however, the development of new antibodies directed against the V600E protein has opened the door for an easier and more efficient strategy for identifying this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our present aim was to determine the efficacy of one such antibody, anti-B-Raf (V600E), a mouse monoclonal antibody in which the immunogen is a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> derived from the internal region of BRAFV600E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 cases of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0012056'>cutaneous melanoma</z:hpo> were evaluated using a combination of DNA-based techniques that included allele-specific PCR and/or direct DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002895'>papillary thyroid carcinomas</z:hpo> (n=5) and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (n=5), known to harbor the BRAFV600E mutation, served as positive controls for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA analyses revealed that 6 of 35 (17%) cases of the primary cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> possessed the BRAFV600E mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For immunohistochemical analyses, cytoplasmic positivity with anti-B-Raf was noted in 7 of 35 (20%) cases of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 positive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses of the data demonstrated that the sensitivity of the immunohistochemistry was 100% and specificity was 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings from the current study support the potential use of immunohistochemistry as an ancillary screening tool to assess the BRAFV600E mutation status in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0012056'>cutaneous melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
