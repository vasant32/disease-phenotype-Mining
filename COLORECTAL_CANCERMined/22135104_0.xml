<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 606,583 type 2 diabetic patients, age 30 years and above, without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims database during the period between January 1 2000 and December 31 2000 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between TZDs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 10,741 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> cases, 7,200 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases, and 70,559 diabetic controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> incidence was found for any use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.65-0.81) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.95), respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TZDs were not associated with lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> incidence, although a potential increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> use â‰¥3 years could not be excluded (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 0.51-4.74) </plain></SENT>
