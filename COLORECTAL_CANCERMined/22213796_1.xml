<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to develop a gene expression classifier for improved risk stratification of patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 315 CRC samples were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression measurements from 207 CRC samples (stage I-IV) from two independent Norwegian clinical series were obtained using Affymetrix exon-level microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed genes between stage I and stage IV samples from the test series were identified and used as input for L1 (lasso) penalised Cox proportional hazards analyses of patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from the same series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second validation was performed in 108 stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples from other populations (USA and Australia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An optimal 13-gene expression classifier (PIGR, CXCL13, MMP3, TUBA1B, SESN1, AZGP1, KLK6, EPHA7, SEMA3A, DSC3, CXCL10, ENPP3, BNIP3) for prediction of relapse among patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was developed using a consecutive Norwegian test series from patients treated according to current standard protocols (n=44, p&lt;0.001, HR=18.2), and its predictive value was successfully validated for patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a second Norwegian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> series collected two decades previously (n=52, p=0.02, HR=3.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further validation of the classifier was obtained in a recent external dataset of patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from other populations (n=108, p=0.001, HR=6.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analyses, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three sample series and various clinicopathological variables, confirmed the independent prognostic value of the classifier (pâ‰¤0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The classifier was shown to be specific to stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and does not provide prognostic stratification of patients with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study presents the development and validation of a 13-gene expression classifier, ColoGuideEx, for prognosis prediction specific to patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The robustness was shown across patient series, populations and different microarray versions </plain></SENT>
