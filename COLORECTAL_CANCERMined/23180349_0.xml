<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bax proapoptotic protein may correlate to chemosensitivity and differential response to irinotecan or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bax expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 49 advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients enrolled at our institution from 2002 to 2004 within a multicenter, phase II, randomized trial of first-line UFT/leucovorin/irinotecan (TEGAFIRI) versus UFT/leucovorin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (TEGAFOX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bax-positive and negative samples were 49 and 51 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response was significantly lower in Bax positive (25 %) as compared to Bax negative (56 %) (Odds ratio = 0.26; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was noted in TEGAFOX subgroup; in TEGAFIRI arm, responses were lower in Bax positive (18 %) than Bax negative (67 %) (Odds ratio = 0.11; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in terms of progression-free and overall survival was observed according to Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bax-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may identify a specific phenotype of patients with significantly higher chance to respond to doublet irinotecan-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
