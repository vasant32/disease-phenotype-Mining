<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on the treatment received by rural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and have not examined their diagnostic pathways as reasons for poorer outcomes in rural Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare and explore symptom appraisal and help-seeking behaviour in patients with breast, lung, prostate or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from rural Western Australia (WA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mixed-methods study of people recently diagnosed with breast, lung, prostate or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from rural WA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time from first symptom to diagnosis (i.e. total diagnostic interval, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) was calculated from interviews and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six participants were recruited (24 breast, 20 colorectal, 14 prostate and 8 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant difference in time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to seeking help between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Geometric mean symptom appraisal for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was significantly longer than that for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancers</z:e> [geometric mean differences: 2.58 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.64-4.53), P = 0.01; 3.97 (1.63-6.30), P = 0.001, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant overall difference in arithmetic mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> (P = 0.046); <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> was significantly shorter than colorectal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> [mean difference : 266.3 days (95% CI: 45.9-486.8), P = 0.019; 277.0 days, (32.1-521.9), P = 0.027, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences were explained by the nature and personal interpretation of symptoms, perceived as well as real problems of access to health care, optimism, stoicism, machismo, fear, embarrassment and competing demands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Longer symptom appraisal was observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants defined core characteristics of rural Australians as optimism, stoicism and machismo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These features, as well as access to health care, contribute to later presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
