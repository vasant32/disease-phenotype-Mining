<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Several studies have described the efficacy of topical vitamin K1 cream in the prevention and treatment of acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> during cetuximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objectives: An interventional study with a historical control was conducted to investigate the efficacy of vitamin K1 cream for acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> associated with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: For the historical control, data were collected from 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who had participated in a previous clinical trial of cetuximab plus irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental group consisted of 61 patients who were instructed to prophylactically apply topical vitamin K1 cream beginning on the first day of cetuximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence, severity, and time to occurrence of acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: The incidence of grade ≥2 acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> after 4 weeks of cetuximab treatment was 42.5% in the historical control group and 55.5% in the experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to grade ≥2 rash in the experimental group was 4 weeks compared to 6 weeks in the historical control group (p = 0.340) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, male gender was the only independent risk factor for grade 2 or worse acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (HR = 2.49; 95% CI, 1.27-4.88; p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic application of topical vitamin K1 cream did not decrease the risk of acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (HR = 1.33; 95% CI, 0.57-3.10; p = 0.507) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The prophylactic application of topical vitamin K1 cream did not translate into clinically meaningful benefit in terms of reducing acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
