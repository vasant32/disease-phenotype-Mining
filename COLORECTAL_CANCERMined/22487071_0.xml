<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy has in some series been linked with increased morbidity after a hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hepatic injuries may result from the treatment with chemotherapy, but can also be secondary to co-morbid diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to draw correlations between clinical features, treatment with chemotherapy and injury phenotypes and assess the impact of each upon perioperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective samples (n= 232) were scored grading <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>, steatohepatitis and sinusoidal injury (SI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were retrieved from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations were drawn between injury, clinical features and perioperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Injury rates were 18%, 4% and 19% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>, steatohepatitis and SI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> was more common in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [odds ratio (OR) = 3.33, P= 0.01] and patients with a higher weight (OR/kg = 1.04, P= 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Steatohepatitis was increased with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (OR = 5.88, P= 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy overall demonstrated a trend towards an approximately doubled risk of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> and steatohepatitis although not affecting SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, pre-operative chemotherapy was associated with an increased SI (OR = 2.18, P= 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Operative morbidity was not increased with chemotherapy, but was increased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> (OR = 2.38, P= 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and higher weight significantly increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> significantly increased risk of steatohepatitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> increases perioperative morbidity, not administration of chemotherapy per se </plain></SENT>
