<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several preclinical and observational studies have shown that bisphosphonates may have chemopreventive effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies evaluating the effect of bisphosphonates on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Web of Science through August 2012 and manually reviewed the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) evaluated and clearly defined exposure to bisphosphonates, (2) reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> outcomes, and (3) reported relative risks or odds ratio (OR) or provided sufficient data for their estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary OR estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was assessed with the Cochran's Q and I(2) statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analyzed data from 6 population-based observational studies reporting 20,001 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 392,106 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of these studies showed a statistically significant 17% reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence with bisphosphonate use (unadjusted OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90), with borderline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> across studies (Cochran's Q, P = .16; I(2) = 37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect persisted after correcting for multiple covariates in individual studies (adjusted OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the analysis was restricted to women only, use of bisphosphonates was associated with a 16% reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence, which bordered on statistical significance (n = 5 studies; adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.70-1.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This chemopreventive effect of bisphosphonates was observed for proximal and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on meta-analysis, bisphosphonate use is associated with a modest, but statistically significant, reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
