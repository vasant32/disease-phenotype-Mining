<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Herein we report a proof-of-principle study illustrating a novel dog-human comparison strategy that addresses a central aim of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> research, namely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> driver-passenger distinction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> canine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) share similar molecular pathogenesis mechanisms as their human counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the genome-wide copy number abnormalities between 29 human and 10 canine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This led to the identification of 73 driver candidate genes (DCGs), altered in both species, and with 27 from the whole genome and 46 from dog-human genomic rearrangement breakpoint (GRB) regions, as well as 38 passenger candidate genes (PCGs), altered in humans only and located in GRB regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We noted that DCGs significantly differ from PCGs in every analysis conducted to assess their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> relevance and biological functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, although PCGs are not enriched in any specific functions, DCGs possess significantly enhanced functionality closely associated with cell proliferation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> regulation, as well as with epithelial cell apicobasal polarity establishment/maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations support the notion that, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> of both species, cell polarity genes not only contribute in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell invasion and spreading, but also likely serve as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors by modulating cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pilot study validates our novel strategy and has uncovered four new potential cell polarity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> suppressor genes (RASA3, NUPL1, DENND5A and AVL9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expansion of this study would make more driver-passenger distinctions for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with large genomic amplifications or deletions, and address key questions regarding the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> pathogenesis and epithelial cell polarity control in mammals.Oncogene advance online publication, 18 February 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.17 </plain></SENT>
