<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in individuals with a family history of the disease has been observed consistently in the past studies, limited information is available on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with family history in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this study is to define the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING AND DESIGN: The present study was designed as an unmatched case control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cases were 393 patients with histologically confirmed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and there were 393 controls, randomly selected from among the healthy participants in a health survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The family history was extracted from a standard history form completed by the patient or from the record created by a health care provider </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mantel-Heanszel Odds Ratio was computed for removing the confounding effect of age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was reported by 36.4 and 24.4% among the cases and controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> risk increased two-fold in subjects who reported having first degree relatives with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio was 4.76, indicating that having a positive family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among relatives increased one's risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> about 4.5-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to our findings, a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Due to this fact that there is no current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening program in Iran, it is recommended that first degree relatives of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> should be considered as a priority group for screening programs </plain></SENT>
