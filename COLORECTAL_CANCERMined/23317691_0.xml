<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the Nurse-Assessed Patient Comfort Score (NAPCOMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective scale validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> screening centers in the United Kingdom and Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 300 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy at participating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The NAPCOMS was developed by using a modified Delphi process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During colonoscopy, two endoscopy room nurses independently observed and rated patient comfort and tolerability by using NAPCOMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, endoscopists reported global comfort scores and patients' reported global comfort by using visual 4-point Likert and National Health Service-United Kingdom Global Rating Scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Reliability and validity of NAPCOMS was measured by using intraclass correlations (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) between nurse ratings of colonoscopies and between NAPCOMS, endoscopist ratings, and patient ratings of global comfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> for the overall NAPCOMS was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was high agreement between the NAPCOMS and endoscopist ratings of comfort (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.72-0.81), moderate agreement between the NAPCOMS and patient ratings (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.53-0.67), and moderate agreement between the endoscopist and patient ratings (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: NAPCOMS was validated in outpatients who received colonoscopy with minimal to moderate sedation as part of a screening and surveillance program, so performance among inpatients or those requiring deep sedation was not tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NAPCOMS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing patient comfort in the setting of outpatient colonoscopy performed with minimal to moderate sedation </plain></SENT>
