<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Readministration of chemotherapeutic agents by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) has the rationale of providing higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAI of fluorouracil with leucovorin (HAI 5-FU/LV) for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who received HAI 5-FU/LV after failure of systemic chemotherapy containing fluorouracil and leucovorin were identified and their medical records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 10 patients evaluable for response, one partial response, six stable disease, and three progressive disease were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the overall response and disease control rates were 7% and 50%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to progression was 4.3 months (range, 2.9 to 5.6), to hepatic progression was 5.8 months (range, 4.7 to 6.9), and to extrahepatic progression was 5.8 months (range, 2.3 to 9.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities occurred and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral mucositis</z:e> were the only grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Catheter-related complications occurred in three patients: one <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and one displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HAI 5-FU/LV was well tolerated and showed modest efficacy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Readministration of previously used chemotherapeutic agents via the hepatic artery could be an effective salvage option and warrants further investigation in a prospective trial </plain></SENT>
