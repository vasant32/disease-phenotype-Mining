<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and its correlation with clinicopathological factors were recently reported by us </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show LGR5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> specimens by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization and assess a correlation with clinicopathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean expression of LGR5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in cancerous tissues was five times higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LGR5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression show marked variation among cases and significantly increased in cases where lymphatic invasion was present compared with those where it was absent (P = 0.0056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the mean expression level of LGR5 was observed to be higher in nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and venous invasion positive cases compared to negative cases, a significant difference was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that LGR5 can be a biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
