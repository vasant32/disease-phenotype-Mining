<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients with mCRC initially unresectable according to predefined criteria were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative treatment consisted of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy, which was followed by surgery in patients showing clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resection rate was the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response rate (RR) and clinical benefit of preoperative chemotherapy, and overall survival (OS) were secondary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 120 eligible patients were included and received preoperative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was irinotecan-based in 73 (61 %) patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based in 25 (21 %) and 22 (18 %) patients received more than one line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A RR of 30 % and a clinical benefit rate of 73 % were observed with preoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metastatic resection was possible in 61 (51 %) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median OS was 33 months (95 % CI 31-NA months) for patients undergoing surgery, and 15 months (95 % CI 11-25 months) in non-operated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients experienced 59 postoperative complications (morbidity rate 57 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preoperative bevacizumab-based chemotherapy offers a high surgical rescue rate in patients with initially unresectable mCRC </plain></SENT>
