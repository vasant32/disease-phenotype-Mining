<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delivery of proteins with anticancer activity through genetically modified bacteria provides an interesting, potentially specific, economic and effective approach here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) is an important and powerful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor in the colon and is thus an attractive candidate protein for delivery through genetically modified bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has not been shown, however, that BMP production in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> context is effective on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that transforming E. coli with a cDNA encoding an ileal-derived mature human BMP-2 induces effective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in an in vitro model system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, whereas the maternal organism was not effective in this respect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these effects were sensitive to cotreatment with the BMP inhibitor Noggin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using transgenic bacteria is feasible </plain></SENT>
