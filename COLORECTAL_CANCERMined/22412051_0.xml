<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To extend the biomedical scientist (BMS) cut-up role to include gastrointestinal category D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection specimens, and to address issues of quality and safety by presenting performance data from the first 50 BMS cut-up specimens in comparison with national guidelines and pathologist performance over the same timeframe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Close mentoring and consultant supervision was carried out for every case with adherence to standard operating procedures and following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> dataset guidelines as published by the Royal College of Pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Performance targets were audited including anticipated spread of Dukes' stage, targets for mean lymph node harvest, percentage extramural vascular invasion and serosal involvement, and mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> blocks sampled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological pre-reporting of 20 cases was encouraged, and time spent by BMS and consultant at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of specimen reporting was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Performance targets were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exceeded by the BMS and compared favourably with pathologist performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A measure of consultant cut-up and histology reporting time saved was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Benefits of extending the BMS role to category D specimens may include BMS professional advancement, efficient use of consultant time and the development of a team approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The achievement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> performance targets and favourable comparison with pathologist performance implies there was no perceived detrimental effect on quality or safety and thus patient management </plain></SENT>
