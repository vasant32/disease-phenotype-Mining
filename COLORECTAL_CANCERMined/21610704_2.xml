<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied the quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease or toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis to provide an integrated measure of clinical benefit, with the objective of comparing quality-adjusted survival between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the trial design allowed patients on BSC alone to receive panitumumab after disease progression, which confounded overall survival (OS), the focus of this analysis was on PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For each treatment group, the time spent in the toxicity (grade 3 or 4 adverse events; TOX), time without symptoms of disease or toxicity (TWiST), and relapse (after disease progression; REL) states were estimated by the product-limit method, and adjusted using utility weights derived from patient-reported EuroQoL 5-dimensions measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were performed in which utility weights (varying from 0 to 1) were applied to time in the TOX and REL health states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference between groups favouring panitumumab+BSC in quality-adjusted PFS (12.3 weeks vs 5.8 weeks, respectively, P&lt;0.0001) and quality-adjusted OS (P=0.0303) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with chemo-refractory <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC, panitumumab+BSC significantly improved quality-adjusted survival compared with BSC alone </plain></SENT>
