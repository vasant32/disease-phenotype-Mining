<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed P-POSSUM scores in patients undergoing resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and benign liver dis-ease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Data for 664 elective liver resections were included between 1998 and 2009; 480 for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>; 96 for benign and 88 for non-colorectal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peri-operative management was standardised according to unit protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: P-POSSUM predicted mortality was 3.73%, 6.27% and 9.99% for benign, colorectal and non-colorectal can-cer patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>60-day mortality was 1.04%, 1.88% and 6.81%, p&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was correlation between predicted and actual mortality in non-colorectal patients, p=0.029 and weak correlation between physiological score and mortality in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were high-er physiological scores in patients with morbidity and higher predicted mortality in colorectal patients experiencing morbidity, p=0.014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was correlation be-tween observed and expected operative mortality in benign and non-colorectal patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival was unaffected by various aspects of the P-POSSUM system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Predicted mortality is over estimated in patients undergoing liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative,physiological score and predicted mortality may have a role predicting morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>P-POSSUM is ineffective in predicting prognosis following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> resection, although may be used to stratify risk in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1512441" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">high risk cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
