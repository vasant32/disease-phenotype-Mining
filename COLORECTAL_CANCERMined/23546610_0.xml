<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the limitations of such indices, we used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived measures of body fat obtained in the Women's Health Initiative to examine the association between body fat and risk of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared these risk estimates with those obtained using conventional anthropometric measurements (body mass index and waist circumference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After exclusions, the study population consisted of 11,124 postmenopausal women with DXA measurements at baseline and no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up period of 12.9 years, 169 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox's proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for the exposures of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither DXA-derived body fat measures nor anthropometric measures showed significant associations with risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of the limited number of cases, we cannot rule out the existence of weak associations of these measures with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
