<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the association between C4.4A expression at the invasion front of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding, a putative hallmark of cell invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (T2-4, n = 126) had a budding count of 3.66 ± 5.66, which was significantly higher than that of T1 early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (1.75 ± 2.78, n = 87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C4.4A-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens showed a larger budding cell number than C4.4A-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens in T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, and especially advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (9.45 ± 5.83 vs 1.60 ± 3.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found a correlation between the percentage of C4.4A-positive cases and budding count in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis for patients' survival showed that C4.4A was superior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding as a prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With siRNA treatment, C4.4A levels were associated with cell invasion, but not with proliferation, in HCT116 and DLD1 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical study in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> showed no relationship between C4.4A and Ki-67 proliferation marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro assays using HCT116 indicated that C4.4A levels correlated well with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with regard to cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and alterations of EMT markers including E-cadherin, vimentin, and partially N-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found that C4.4A expression was significantly associated with loss of E-cadherin and gain of β-catenin in clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a tight association between C4.4A and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding may, in part, be due to C4.4A promoting EMT at the invasive front of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
