<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is effective in a subset of KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After an initial response, secondary resistance invariably ensues, thereby limiting the clinical benefit of this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular bases of secondary resistance to cetuximab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that molecular alterations (in most instances point mutations) of KRAS are causally associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of mutant KRAS under the control of its endogenous gene promoter was sufficient to confer cetuximab resistance, but resistant cells remained sensitive to combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein-kinase kinase (MEK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from patients who developed resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab showed the emergence of KRAS amplification in one sample and acquisition of secondary KRAS mutations in 60% (6 out of 10) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutant alleles were detectable in the blood of cetuximab-treated patients as early as 10 months before radiographic documentation of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, the results identify KRAS mutations as frequent drivers of acquired resistance to cetuximab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, indicate that the emergence of KRAS mutant clones can be detected non-invasively months before radiographic progression and suggest early initiation of a MEK inhibitor as a rational strategy for delaying or reversing drug resistance </plain></SENT>
