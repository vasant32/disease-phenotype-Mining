<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to identify dietary patterns and estimate their effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> occurrence and to quantify the association between family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> occurrence by applying multilevel models to estimate and interpret measures of variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Principal components factor analysis was performed to identify dietary patterns that were then used in a multilevel logistic regression applied to an ongoing case-control data about dietary exposure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> occurrence taking into account familiar clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three dietary patterns were identified: "Southern Cone pattern" (red meat, wine, and starchy vegetables), "High-sugar drinks pattern", and "Prudent pattern" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study considered 41 cases and 95 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant promoting effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of "Southern Cone" (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.0-2.2) and "High-sugar drinks" (OR 3.8, 95%CI 2.0-7.1) patterns, whereas "Prudent pattern" (OR 0.3, 95%CI 0.2-0.4) showed a significant protective effect at third tertile level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI, use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>, and to have medical insurance showed significant effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variance of the random effect of family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel approach for Argentina showed that Southern Cone and High-sugar drinks patterns were associated with a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, whereas the Prudent pattern showed a protective effect </plain></SENT>
