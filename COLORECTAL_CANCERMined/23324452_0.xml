<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Insulin, 25-hydroxy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitaminD3</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> have been differently associated with a risk of colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acromegalic patients have an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> and an association between fasting insulin concentrations and colonic lesions has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> interact to determine the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic tumors</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim: To investigate whether serum insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were associated with precancerous colonic lesions in acromegalic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Material and methods: A cohort of 146 consecutive acromegalic patients was evaluated for colonoscopy findings and fasting insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A preliminary study was conducted in 9 na√Øve acromegalic patients to evaluate the effect of somatostatin analogues (SSA) on serum levels of those factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Insulin reduced during SSA whereas the other factors did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cohort study, colonic lesions[14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>; 32 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath>] were detected in 46 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels did not differ in patients with or without colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels were associated with a lower risk of developing precancerous colonic lesions at the multivariate analysis, when corrected by age, gender, disease activity and SSA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Serum insulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> serum concetrantions do not seem to influence the development of precancerous colonic lesions in acromegalic patients, while higher <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels may be associated with a lower risk of colonic lesions </plain></SENT>
