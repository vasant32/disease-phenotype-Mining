<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphatidylinositol glycan, class K (PIGK), is a crucial member of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol transamidase (GPIT) protein complex that attaches a diverse group of macromolecules to the plasma membrane of eukaryotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the precise role of PIGK in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported low expression of PIGK protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> compared to paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To understand the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we performed sequencing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 exons of the PIGK gene in 45 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Corresponding PIGK protein expression was also evaluated in these patients by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No mutation was detected in the coding regions, however, we found a single nucleotide polymorphism (C/C→C/G or G/G; rs1048575) in the 3'UTR of the PIGK gene in 67% (30/45) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients (22/26, 85%) with the altered alleles were of Jewish origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, 47% (8/17) of the Arabian patients exhibited the altered C/G alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed a significantly low (p&lt;0.002) expression of PIGK protein in the patients with the altered alleles (C/G or G/G) compared to the ancestral alleles (C/C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, we also examined 5 <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> patients and two <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> cell lines (Hep3B and HepG2) for PIGK genotype (SNP-1048575) and corresponding protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed altered alleles (C/G or G/G) and corresponding low PIGK protein expression in 4 out of 5 (80%) primary <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> cell lines, HepG2 line exhibited ancestral C/C alleles, whereas Hep3B showed altered C/G alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar to the <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> patients, Hep3B line with the altered alleles (C/G) exhibited significantly low (Student's t-test, p&lt;0.002) PIGK protein expression compared to the Hep3B line carrying the ancestral (C/C) alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To examine the exogenous PIGK protein expression status, we transiently transfected both HepG2 (C/C alleles) and Hep3B (C/G alleles) cell lines with wt-PIGK constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We detected exogenously expressed PIGK protein in HepG2 (C/C) cells, but no PIGK expression was detectable in Hep3B (C/G) cells at either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate, for the first time, a link between the SNP 1048575 and low PIGK expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> patients and also suggest a possible association between altered PIGK expression and disease susceptibility </plain></SENT>
