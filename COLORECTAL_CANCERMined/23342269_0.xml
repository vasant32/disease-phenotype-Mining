<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 3359 patients treated with FOLFOX4 were analyzed: 1515 from two Asian studies (Japanese Post Marketing Surveillance [J-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi>] and MASCOT) and 1844 from four Western studies (EFC2962, N9741, EFC4584, and MOSAIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of NSAEs was analyzed in terms of treatment duration and cumulative dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade ≥3 NSAEs ranged from 2.0% to 4.4% in Asian studies and 9.3% to 19% in Western studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> that induced grade ≥3 NSAEs in 10% of patients were higher in Asian studies (1526 mg/m(2) or not reached) than in Western studies (805-832 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were noted between occurrence of grade ≥3 NSAEs and demographic/baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of escalation from grade 0 to 1 in J-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi> was statistically significantly lower than that in EFC4584, and that from grade 0 to 1 and from grade 1 to 2 in MASCOT lower than that in MOSAIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> doses administered during grade escalation in J-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="53396,53430,8055">PMS</z:chebi> were similar to those in EFC2962 or EFC4584 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> grade-3 NSAEs in MASCOT and 96% of those in MOSAIC improved to grade 2 or less within 12 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Asian populations accrued to these studies appear to be less susceptible to the neurotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> than the mainly Caucasian populations in the Western studies </plain></SENT>
