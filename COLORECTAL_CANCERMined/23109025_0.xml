<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of present study was to evaluate the efficacy of chemoembolization for inoperable metastatic liver lesions from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> resistant to systemic chemotherapy were enrolled in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each patient, three session of TACE were conducted with 45 days interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25357">mitomycin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and lipiodol were used for TACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A tri-phasic computed tomography scan and biochemical laboratory tests were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at baseline and 30 days after each TACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Image analysis included measurement of lesion diameters as well as contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients deceased before completing three session and the final analyses were performed on the remaining 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of a total 93 lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after chemoembolization sessions revealed a 25.88% reduction in anteroposterior (AP) diameter, 33.92% transverse (T) diameter, and 42.22% in product of APxT diameter of lesions (P&lt;0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed a total disappearance of 33% of lesions and evident reduction in contrast enhancement in 16% of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in contrast enhancement in 51% of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of single largest lesion in each patient revealed 57.32% reduction in AP diameter, 59.66% in T diameter, and 62.17% in product of APxT diameters (P&lt;0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diameters) </plain></SENT>
