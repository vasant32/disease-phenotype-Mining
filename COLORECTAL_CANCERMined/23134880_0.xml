<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In our published randomized trial in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, group 1 (n = 37) received individualized nutritional counseling and education about regular foods, group 2 (n = 37) received dietary supplements and consumed their usual diet of regular foods, and group 3 (n = 37) consumed their usual diet of regular foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neither group 2 nor group 3 received individualized counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early nutritional counseling during radiotherapy was highly effective at reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> radiotherapy toxicity and improving nutritional intake/status and quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy persisted for 3 mo after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to perform long-term follow-up in survivors of that clinical trial to specifically evaluate survival, late toxicity, QoL, and nutritional variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Medical data were collected from patients' records, and prescheduled interviews were conducted by dietitians for individualized evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses and comparisons between groups (adjusted for stage) were performed after a median follow-up of 6.5 (range: 4.9-8.1) y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients complied with the Radiotherapy Department's follow-up protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nutritional deterioration was higher (P &lt; 0.001) in group 3 (n = 26) and group 2 (n = 29) than in group 1 (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adequate nutritional status was maintained in 91% of group 1 patients but not in any of the group 3 patients (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intakes in group 1 were similar to reference values, and the patients adhered to the prescribed recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intakes in groups 2 and 3 were lower than recommended intakes: group 3 ≃ group 2 &lt; group 1 (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median survival in group 3 was 4.9 y (30% died), in group 2 was 6.5 y (22% died), and in group 1 was 7.3 y (only 8% died): group 3 &gt; group 2 &gt; group 1 (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Late radiotherapy toxicity was higher in group 3 (n = 17; 65%) and group 2 (n = 17; 59%) than in group 1 (n = 3; 9%): group 3 ≃ group 2 &gt; group 1 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>QoL was worse in groups 3 and 2 than in group 1: group 3 ≃ group 2 &lt; group 1 (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Worse radiotherapy toxicity, QoL, and mortality were associated with deteriorated nutritional status and intake (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Likewise, depleted intake, nutritional status, and QoL predicted shorter survival and late toxicity (HR: 8.25; 95% CI: 2.74, 1.47; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study conveys novel information about the effectiveness of nutrition at improving long-term prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Overall, the data indicate that early individualized nutritional counseling and education during radiotherapy is valuable for patients </plain></SENT>
