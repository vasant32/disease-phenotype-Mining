<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: About 221 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases, and 219 controls, frequency-matched on age and smoking intensity were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation of 1505 CpG sites selected from 807 genes were evaluated using Illumina GoldenGate Methylation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Panel I in pre-diagnostic blood leukocytes of study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tertiles of methylation level classified according to the distribution in controls for each CpG site were used to analyze the association between methylation level and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk with logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time between blood draw to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis (classifying cases according to latency) was incorporated in further analyses using proportional odds regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that methylation changes of 31 CpG sites were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk at P &lt; 0.01 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Though none of these 31 sites remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction, the most statistically significant CpG site associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk achieved a P value of 1.0 × 10(-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CpG site is located in DSP gene, and the risk estimate was 1.52 (95% CI: 0.91-2.53) and 2.62 (95% CI: 1.65-4.17) for the second and third tertile comparing with the lowest tertile respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taking the latency information into account strengthened some associations, suggesting that the methylation levels of corresponding sites might change over time with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the methylation level of some genes were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility and some were related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to confirm and refine our results </plain></SENT>
