<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as a model, the relationship between exposure (cetuximab, C225, therapeutic drug of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) and the biomarker response (carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA, biomarker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) is the core for the QP of C225 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, simultaneous detection of CEA and C225 is the first step towards an assay for the QP of C225 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">quantum dot</z:chebi> (QD)-based multi-analyte biosensor for the simultaneous determination of CEA and the corresponding therapeutic drug C225 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assay is based on the competition between a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">quantum-dots</z:chebi>-labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> and target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> using lectins as the recognition element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dual-analytic biosensor detected CEA and C225 in the range from 1 ng mL(-1) to 400 Î¼g mL(-1) by stripping voltammetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The biosensor developed here for the simultaneous detection of the biomarkers and therapeutic drugs is expected to develop as a potential technique for quantitative pharmacology </plain></SENT>
