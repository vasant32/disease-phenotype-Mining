<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied miRNA expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsies of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> to identify a specific "signature" correlating with pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 38 T3-4/N+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and radiotherapy followed by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathologic response was scored according to the Mandard TRG scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MiRNA expression was analyzed by microarray and confirmed by real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) on frozen biopsies obtained before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between miRNA expression and TRG, coded as TRG1 (pCR) vs. TRG &gt;1 (no pCR), was assessed by methods specifically designed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microarray analysis selected 14 miRNAs as being differentially expressed in TRG1 patients, and 13 were confirmed by qRT-PCR: 11 miRNAs (miR-1183, miR-483-5p, miR-622, miR-125a-3p, miR-1224-5p, miR-188-5p, miR-1471, miR-671-5p, miR-1909âˆ—, miR-630, miR-765) were significantly upregulated in TRG1 patients, 2 (miR-1274b, miR-720) were downexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MiR-622 and miR-630 had a 100% sensitivity and specificity in selecting TRG1 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A set of 13 miRNAs is strongly associated with pCR and may represent a specific predictor of response to chemoradiotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
