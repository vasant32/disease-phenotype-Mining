<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the value of the faecal occult blood test (FOBT), when administered in primary care, in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent a FOBT (Hemoccult II) at 20 public primary care centres in SÃ¶rmland County, Sweden, during 2000-2005, were included (n=9048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linkage to the Swedish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms recorded at the time of the FOBT were retrieved from the patient records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome from the FOBT to diagnosis and subsequent survival was compared between patients who were FOBT negative and patients who were FOBT positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred and sixty-one patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> within 2 years after undergoing a FOBT in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These comprised 18% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 917 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the county during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 41 (25.4%) of the 161 patients the test was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptoms related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were documented for 158 (98%) patients at the time the FOBT was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median investigation time from the FOBT test to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 91 days: 80 days for FOBT-positive patients and 188 days for FOBT-negative patients (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This difference was significant independent of age, sex and site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for FOBT negativity, 3 years after the FOBT, when adjusted for age and sex, was 1.47 (95% CI, 0.81-2.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite having suggestive symptoms, 41 (4.5%) of 917 CRC patients had a negative FOBT result in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This was associated with diagnostic delay and, potentially, a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
