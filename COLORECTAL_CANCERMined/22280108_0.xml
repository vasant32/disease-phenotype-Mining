<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a nutrient whose benefits are long known and widely publicized, being most of them related to its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, the main role of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> is to neutralize free radicals, reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, some controversial studies suggest that this nutrient may have a preventive and therapeutic role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> disease due to their possible pro-oxidant activity, promoting the formation of reactive oxygen species that can induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This factor, coupled with the decrease of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes and increase of decompartmentalized <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27081">transition metals</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells may result in the selective cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and the subsequent revelation of its therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this way the first purpose of this work was radioactively label the reduced form of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> with Tc-99m, its quality control by HPLC and the time stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second purpose was to use the radioactive complex 99mTc-AA in in vitro and in vivo studies in order to evaluate its uptake by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and biodistribution in mices, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the pharmaceutical formulation developed, which was reproducible and stable over time, was residually taken up by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to deepen our understanding about the radioactive complex 99mTc-AA and clarify the mechanisms of action of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> in oncologic disease </plain></SENT>
