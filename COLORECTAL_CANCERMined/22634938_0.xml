<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oral mucosal vascular aberrations and color changes have been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333990" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, possibly reflecting a subclinical extracellular matrix abnormality implicated in the general process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reasoning that physicochemical changes of a tissue should affect its optical properties, we investigated the diagnostic ability of oral mucosal color to identify patients with several types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 67 patients with several histologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> at different stages were enrolled along with a group of 60 healthy controls of comparable age and sex ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral mucosal color was measured in selected areas, and then univariate, cluster, and principal component analyses were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower red and green and higher blue values were significantly associated with evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.0001), and efficiently discriminated patients from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blue color coordinate showed significantly higher sensitivity and specificity (96.66±2.77 and 97.16±3.46%, respectively) compared with the red and green coordinates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the second principal component coordinate of the red-green clusters discriminated patients from controls with 98.2% sensitivity and 95% specificity (cut-off criterion≤0.4547; P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The scatterplots of the chrominances revealed the formation of two well separated clusters, separating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients from controls with a 99.4% probability of correct classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the ability of oral color to encode clinically relevant biophysical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the near future, this low-cost and noninvasive method may become a useful tool for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
