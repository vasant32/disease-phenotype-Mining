<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS/METHODS: A nested case-control study (1269 cases matched to 2107 controls by sex, age, study centre and date of blood collection) was conducted within the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC) to evaluate the impact of rs1229984 (ADH1B), rs1573496 (ADH7) and rs441 (ALDH2) polymorphisms on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> variant of each polymorphism as reference category, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk estimates were calculated using conditional logistic regression, with adjustment for matching factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individuals carrying one copy of the rs1229984(A) (ADH1B) allele (fast metabolizers) showed an average daily alcohol intake of 4.3 g per day lower than subjects with two copies of the rs1229984(G) allele (slow metabolizers) (P(diff)&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the polymorphisms was associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the colon</z:e> or rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heavy alcohol intake was more strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk among carriers of the rs1573496(C) allele, with odds ratio equal to 2.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.26-3.59) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> subjects with low alcohol consumption (P(interaction)=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rs1229984(A) (ADH1B) allele was associated with a reduction in alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rs1229984 (ADH1B), rs1573496 (ADH7) and rs441 (ALDH2) polymorphisms were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk overall in Western-European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between alcohol and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk might be modulated by the rs1573496 (ADH7) polymorphism </plain></SENT>
