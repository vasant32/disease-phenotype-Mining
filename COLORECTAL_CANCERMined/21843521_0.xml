<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An insertion-deletion (I/D) polymorphism in intron 16 of ACE gene was identified to be functional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the association between ACE I/D polymorphism and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Using genomic DNA from 241 CRC patients and 299 control subjects, we genotyped the ACE I/D polymorphism using a polymerase chain reaction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that patients carrying the D allele were associated with an increased risk of developing poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> compared with those carrying the I allele (OR=1.54, 95%CI, 1.04-2.28; OR=1.56, 95%CI, 1.08-2.26, respectively), although no significant association was observed between cases and controls in overall analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the ACE I/D polymorphism is likely to play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
