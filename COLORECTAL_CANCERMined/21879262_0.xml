<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the local recurrence rate and factors associated with recurrence after intraoperative ablation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed for patients who underwent ablation of a hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in the operating room from April 1996 to March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox models were used to determine recurrence rates and assess significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ablation was performed in 10% (n = 158 patients) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight percent were performed in conjunction with a liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 315 tumors ablated, most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were ≤ 1 cm in maximum diameter (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation was used to treat most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (11%) had local recurrence as part of their recurrence pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease recurred in the liver or systemically after 212 tumors (67%) were ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size greater than 1 cm was associated with a significantly increased risk of local recurrence (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.2-4.5, P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 2 year ablation zone recurrence-free survival was 92% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> ≤ 1 cm compared to 81% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> &gt;1 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size of &gt;1 cm, lack of postoperative chemotherapy, and use of cryotherapy were significantly associated with a higher local recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative ablation appears to be highly effective treatment for hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> ≤ 1 cm </plain></SENT>
