<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The standard shotgun proteomics data analysis strategy relies on searching MS/MS spectra against a context-independent protein sequence database derived from the complete genome sequence of an organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because transcriptome sequence analysis (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq) promises an unbiased and comprehensive picture of the transcriptome, we reason that a sample-specific protein database derived from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq data can better approximate the real protein pool in the sample and thus improve protein identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have developed a two-step strategy for building sample-specific protein databases from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, the database size is reduced by eliminating unexpressed or lowly expressed genes according to transcript quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, high-quality nonsynonymous coding single nucleotide variations (SNVs) are identified based on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq data, and corresponding protein variants are added to the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq and shotgun proteomics data from two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines SW480 and RKO, we demonstrated that customized protein sequence databases could significantly increase the sensitivity of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> identification, reduce ambiguity in protein assembly, and enable the detection of known and novel <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, sample-specific databases from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq data can enable more sensitive and comprehensive protein discovery in shotgun proteomics studies </plain></SENT>
