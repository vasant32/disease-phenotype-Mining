<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously reported a negative correlation between the effect of chemotherapy and 25-hydroxy <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) (25-D(3)) levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on this finding, we hypothesized that the response to <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) supplementation may be attenuated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim: To determine 25-D(3) response to 2000 IU/day <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) supplementation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty evaluable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) at 2000 IU/day for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum 25-D(3) levels were measured at baseline, 3, and 6 months of supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean 25-D(3) level was 17.5 ng/ml at baseline, 31.6 ng/ml at 3 months, and 33.8 ng/ml at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important factor in determining 25-D(3) response was chemotherapy status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A rise in 25-D(3) of â‰¥10 ng/ml at the 3-month interval was observed in 92% of chemotherapy-free patients vs. 39% of chemotherapy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar differences in response were noted at the 6-month interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Depressed 25-D(3) levels are common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Active chemotherapy is associated with an attenuated response to 2000 IU of D(3) supplementation in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alternative <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) dosing schedules need further investigation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients undergoing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
