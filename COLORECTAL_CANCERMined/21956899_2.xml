<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In this study, we investigated the prognostic impact of human RBM3 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One polyclonal antibody and four monoclonal anti-RBM3 antibodies were generated and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> mapped using two different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> display revealed five distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for the polyclonal antibody, while the four mouse monoclonal antibodies were found to bind to three of the five <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> suspension bead array assay confirmed the five <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of the polyclonal antibody, while only one of the monoclonal antibodies could be mapped using this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody specificity was confirmed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, including siRNA-mediated knock-down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the antibodies (polyclonal and monoclonal) were subsequently used to analyze RBM3 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from two independent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cohorts, one consecutive cohort (n=270) and one prospectively collected cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751498" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the sigmoid</z:e> colon (n=305) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RBM3-expression was detected, with high correlation between both antibodies (R=0.81, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both cohorts, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with high nuclear RBM3 staining had significantly prolonged the overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was also confirmed in multivariate analysis, adjusted for established prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data demonstrate that high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific nuclear expression of RBM3 is an independent predictor of good prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
