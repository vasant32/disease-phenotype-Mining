<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interventions to promote PA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors need to understand the most critical beliefs that influence PA behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: The objective of this study was to examine the strength of associations between the most common PA beliefs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors and motivational constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as well as PA behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION/METHODS:: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors (n = 600) residing in Alberta, Canada, completed self-report questionnaires assessing medical and demographic variables, PA beliefs, constructs from the TPB, and PA behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors identified improved fitness (69.5%), family members (67.3%), and medical/health problems (8.8%) as the most prevalent behavioral, normative, and control beliefs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> PA beliefs were significantly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TPB constructs and PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Physical activity interventions for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors should target many salient beliefs including behavioral, normative, and control beliefs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:: Insights into the salient beliefs for PA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors can guide nurses in developing successful strategies to promote PA in this population and likely improve quality of life and possibly disease outcomes </plain></SENT>
