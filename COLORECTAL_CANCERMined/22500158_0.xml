<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 397 consecutive patients with curatively resected colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA from these patients was extracted from fresh colorectal tissue, and the 10 polymorphisms in the CASP3, CASP6, CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, and CASP10 genes were determined using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction genotyping assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median patient age was 63 years, and 218 (54.9%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, while 179 (45.1%) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate survival analysis including pathologic stage, patient age, differentiation, and carcinoembryonic antigen level demonstrated that these polymorphisms were not associated with either disease-free or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: None of the 10 polymorphisms in the CASP genes investigated in this study was found to be an independent prognostic marker for Korean patients with curatively resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
