<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the effects of fast track surgery on postoperative insulin sensitivity in patients undergoing elective open colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 2008 to January 2009 with one-month post-discharge follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> requiring colorectal resection were randomized into two groups: a fast track group (35 cases) and a conventional care group (35 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> included patients received elective open colorectal resection with combined tracheal intubation and general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters (complication rates, return of gastrointestinal function and postoperative length of stay), stress index and insulin sensitivity were evaluated in both groups perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two patients finally completed the study, 32 cases in the fast-track group and 30 cases in the conventional care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings revealed a significantly faster recovery of postoperative insulin sensitivity on postoperative day 7 in the fast-track group than that in the conventional care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found a significantly shorter length of postoperative stay and a significantly faster return of gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing fast-track rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fast track surgery accelerates the recovery of postoperative insulin sensitivity in elective surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with a shorter length of postoperative hospital stay </plain></SENT>
