<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The study assessed the role of colorectal surgery in the treatment of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and identified patients who can most benefit from surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective analysis was made of 34 consecutive patients with skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> who underwent surgical resection of large bowel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median disease-free interval between diagnosis of the primary and metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> was 24 (7-98) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine (27%) patients underwent emergency surgery for obstruction and 25 (73%) had an elective procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resection with curative intent was performed in 14 (41%) and palliative resection in 20 (59%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no postoperative mortality and morbidity occurred in 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival following surgery was 11.5 (4-68) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rates were 50%, 32% and 17% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival was significantly increased in patients without extra-abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, with no evidence of non-large-bowel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, if the disease-free interval was longer than 24 months and when curative resection was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, an apparently complete or palliative resection and the absence or presence of extra-abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were the most important prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An aggressive surgical approach to large bowel metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> results in good palliation and effective relief of symptoms with acceptable morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
