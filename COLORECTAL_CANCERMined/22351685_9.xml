<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although the central role of the immune system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> prognosis is generally accepted, a single robust marker is not yet available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: On the basis of receiver operating characteristic analyses, robust markers were identified from a 60-gene B cell-derived metagene and analyzed in gene expression profiles of 1,810 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>; 1,056 non-small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>); 513 colorectal; and 426 ovarian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels were examined in paraffin-embedded tissue of 330 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell types were identified with immunohistochemical costaining and confocal fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified immunoglobulin Îº C (IGKC) which as a single marker is similarly predictive and prognostic as the entire B-cell metagene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IGKC was consistently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free survival across different molecular subtypes in node-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (n = 965) and predicted response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 845; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, IGKC gene expression was prognostic in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IGKC protein expression was significantly associated with survival in paraffin-embedded tissues of 330 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>-infiltrating plasma cells were identified as the source of IGKC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings provide IGKC as a novel diagnostic marker for risk stratification in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and support concepts to exploit the humoral immune response for anticancer therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It could be validated in several independent cohorts and carried out similarly well in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from fresh frozen as well as from paraffin tissue and on protein level by immunostaining </plain></SENT>
