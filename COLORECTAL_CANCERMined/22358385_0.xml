<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess their effect on overall response rate (ORR), the rate of radical resection (R0) and survival in patients with liver-limited initially unresectable mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs comparing first-line chemotherapy plus or minus C or P and reporting data in patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, unresectable liver-limited mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence interval were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS) was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four RCTs involving 484 KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to chemotherapy alone, the addition of C or P significantly increased the ORR (RR 1.67, p = 0.0001), the R0 resection rate from 11% to 18% (RR 1.59, p = 0.04) and PFS (HR 0.68, p = 0.002), but not OS (p = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of C and P increased the R0 resection rate by 60% and reduced the risk of progression by 32% in patients with mCRC and unresectable liver-limited disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This combination represents one of the preferred choices as conversion therapy in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients with unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
