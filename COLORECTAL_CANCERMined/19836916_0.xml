<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Incidental extracolonic findings affect patient treatment and cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to consider magnetic resonance colonography (MRC) as a tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> screening, more knowledge is needed on extracolonic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine the prevalence and the spectrum of extracolonic findings in patients with an increased risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> that underwent bright lumen MRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRC examinations were performed in 210 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> solution was administered rectally for distension of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracolonic findings were scored by two radiologists and classified by using C-RADS Reporting System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> findings (with advice regarding work-up) were reported to the patient's physician and followed up for 4.5 years on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Extracolonic findings were found in 125 (59.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten (4.8%) had "potentially important" findings (C-RADS category E4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (11.9%) had "likely unimportant" findings (E3), 90 (42.8%) had "clinically unimportant" findings (E2) and 85 (40.5%) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> exam (E1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 14 (6.7%) patients additional work-up was performed for their incidentally discovered lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In three of them surgery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After work-up, only in two (1.0%) patients a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The number of new relevant extracolonic findings is small and the required additional work-up is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This should be considered for implementation of 'bright lumen' MRC as a screening tool </plain></SENT>
