<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 99 patients with stage I-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent resection were prospectively studied for KRAS mutations by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were found in 37 (37.4%) of 99 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 11.1% were the KRAS p.G13D mutation and the remaining 26.2% were other KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 5-year survival rates for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS, KRAS 12 and KRAS p.G13D mutations were 81.4, 61.4 and 42.0%, respectively (P=0.0397) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The KRAS genotype had no effect on stage IV patient prognosis without anti-epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in stage I-III patients significant or trends in prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) were pathological T stage, lymphatic vessel involvement and KRAS p.G13D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified T4 pathological stage (P=0.0076) and the KRAS p.G13D mutation (P=0.0499) as the most significant independent prognostic factors associated with DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients KRAS p.G13D had prognostic impact on DFS in stage I-III disease, while the prognosis of stage IV patients without anti-EGFR antibody therapy was unaffected by KRAS status </plain></SENT>
