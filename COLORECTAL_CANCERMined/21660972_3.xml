<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a comprehensive analysis of clinico-pathological and molecular features (KRAS, BRAF and microsatellite instability, MSI) as well as of selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>- and host-related protein markers characterizing CIMP-high (CIMP-H), -low, and -negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis for 48 protein markers and molecular analysis of CIMP (CIMP-H: ≥ 4/5 methylated genes), MSI (MSI-H: ≥ 2 instable genes), KRAS, and BRAF were performed on 337 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simple and multiple regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CIMP-H was found in 24 cases (7.1%) and linked (p &lt; 0.0001) to more proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, BRAF mutation, MSI-H, MGMT methylation (p = 0.022), advanced pT classification (p = 0.03), mucinous histology (p = 0.069), and less frequent KRAS mutation (p = 0.067) compared to CIMP-low or -negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 48 protein markers, decreased levels of RKIP (p = 0.0056), EphB2 (p = 0.0045), CK20 (p = 0.002), and Cdx2 (p &lt; 0.0001) and increased numbers of CD8+ intra-epithelial lymphocytes (p &lt; 0.0001) were related to CIMP-H, independently of MSI status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the expected clinico-pathological and molecular associations, CIMP-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are characterized by a loss of protein markers associated with differentiation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> suppression, and have increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes regardless of MSI status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, Cdx2 loss seems to strongly predict CIMP-H in both microsatellite-stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) and MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cdx2 is proposed as a surrogate marker for CIMP-H </plain></SENT>
