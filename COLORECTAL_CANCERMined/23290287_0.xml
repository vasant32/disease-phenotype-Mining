<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) may be even less invasive to patients than conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the applicability of the procedure and we report the first year of experiences and operative quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were selected clinically and after computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Easy resections (or stoma creations) with small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, a body mass index &lt; 30 kg/square meter and American Society of Anesthesiologists group I-II were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were prospectively registered until 1 January 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the standard accelerated "fast track" programme, the use of additional opioids was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SILS was performed in 24 patients including 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eight stoma creations, no scars were left other than the stoma hole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall conversion rate was 17% and the complication rate was 13% with no wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 15 SILS colon resections, median operation time (171 min.), blood loss (0 ml), lymph node harvest (median n = 14), dissection quality (73% mesocolic), specimen length (23 cm), height of vascular pedicle (8 cm) and hospital stay (three days) were comparable to international reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One serious complication of small bowel injury was seen, but this was the only complication (7%) in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With the proviso that our study population was limited in size, SILS seems equal to CLS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery - although with a high conversion rate in the learning period, and it is a suitable procedure for minimal invasion in creation of a stoma </plain></SENT>
