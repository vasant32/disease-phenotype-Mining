<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms underlying this complex, multi-step pathway are yet to be completely elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have stressed the importance of intra-tumoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the development of a metastatic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize the intra-tumoral phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between two iso-clonal human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> sublines HCT116 and HCT116b on their ability to undergo metastatic colonization and survive under growth factor deprivation stress (GFDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: HCT116 and HCT116b cells were transfected with green fluorescence protein and subcutaneously injected into BALB/c <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once xenografts were established, they were excised and orthotopically implanted into other male BALB/c <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice using microsurgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animal tissues were studied for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> using histochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis was performed to generate gene signatures associated with each subline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro assessment of growth factor signaling pathway was performed under GFDS for 3 and 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both HCT116 and HCT116b iso-clonal variants demonstrated 100% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> growth, invasion and peritoneal spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, HCT116 was highly metastatic with 68% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> observed in liver and/or lungs compared to 4% in HCT116b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis revealed an upregulation of survival and metastatic genes in HCT116 cells compared to HCT116b cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In vitro analysis showed that HCT116 upregulated survival and migratory signaling proteins and downregulated apoptotic agents under GFDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, HCT116b cells effectively showed the opposite response under stress inducing cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the importance of clonal variation in determining metastatic potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells using the HCT116/HCT116b iso-clonal variants in an orthotopic metastatic mouse model </plain></SENT>
