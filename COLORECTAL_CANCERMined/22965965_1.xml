<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HORIZON II [Cediranib (AZD2171, RECENTIN) in Addition to Chemotherapy Versus Placebo Plus Chemotherapy in Patients With Untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</z:e>] assessed infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX/CAPOX) with or without cediranib in patients with previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were initially randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive cediranib (20 or 30 mg per day) or placebo plus FOLFOX/CAPOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an early analysis of this and two other cediranib studies (HORIZON I [Cediranib Plus FOLFOX6 Versus Bevacizumab Plus FOLFOX6 in Patients With Previously Treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</z:e>] and HORIZON III [Cediranib Plus FOLFOX6 Versus Bevacizumab Plus FOLFOX6 in Patients With Untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</z:e>]), the 20-mg dose met the predefined criteria for continuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to the cediranib 20 mg or placebo arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were coprimary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 860 patients received cediranib 20 mg (n = 502) or placebo (n = 358) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of cediranib to FOLFOX/CAPOX resulted in PFS prolongation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98; P = .0121; median PFS, 8.6 months for cediranib v 8.3 months for placebo) but had no impact on OS (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.12; P = .5707; median OS, 19.7 months for cediranib v 18.9 months for placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the secondary end points of objective response rate, duration of response, or liver resection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median chemotherapy dose-intensity was decreased by approximately 10% in patients treated with cediranib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) associated with cediranib were manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION Addition of cediranib 20 mg to FOLFOX/CAPOX resulted in a modest PFS prolongation, but no significant difference in OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cediranib AE profile was consistent with those from previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because of the lack of improvement in OS, cediranib plus an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based regimen cannot be recommended as a treatment for patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
