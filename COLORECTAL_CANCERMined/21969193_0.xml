<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients with histologically confirmed advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients were ineligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was evaluated in 60 patients, who had received a part or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the protocol therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A partial response was observed in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 34.5% (95% CI, 22.5%-48.1%) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control rate (partial response + stable disease) was 82.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.1-9.8 months), and the median overall survival was 31.5 months (95% CI, 18.1-40.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no toxicity-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> occurred in 48.3% of patients and often caused a delay in the subsequent treatment course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mild to moderate cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>peripheral sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> affected 71.7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results showed good tolerability and efficacy for first-line FOLFOX4 in the treatment of patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, indicating the promise of this regimen as first-line therapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
