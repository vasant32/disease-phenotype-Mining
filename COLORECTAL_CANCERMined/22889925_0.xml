<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of BBP for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> that progressed on first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 39 patients received FOLFIRI + BV (after FOLFOX + BV) or FOLFOX + BV (after FOLFIRI + BV) as protocol treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), total survival from initiation of first-line treatment (TS), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 39 treated patients were evaluated for toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients did not meet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the eligibility criteria and were excluded from efficacy analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 16.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disease control rate was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median PFS was 150 days (range 117-224) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median OS was 417 days (range 233-813) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median TS was 988 days (range 600-1,268) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 adverse events (% of patients) related to treatment were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (33%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (23%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to show the effect of BBP in patients who had progressive disease on first-line treatment including BV confirmed by RECIST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This analysis suggests the possibility of prolonged survival with continued use of BV </plain></SENT>
