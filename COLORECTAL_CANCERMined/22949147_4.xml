<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) commonly involves a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen such as infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) or fluorouracil, leucovorin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, often combined with bevacizumab or an epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of adding the novel antiangiogenic agent aflibercept (also known as ziv-aflibercept in the United States) to FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, including patients who received prior bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive aflibercept (4 mg/kg intravenously; 612 patients) or placebo (614 patients) every 2 weeks in combination with FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adding aflibercept to FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival relative to placebo plus FOLFIRI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.817; 95.34% CI, 0.713 to 0.937; P = .0032) with median survival times of 13.50 versus 12.06 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aflibercept also significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 0.758; 95% CI, 0.661 to 0.869; P &lt; .0001), with median PFS times of 6.90 versus 4.67 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects on overall survival and PFS exhibited a consistent trend across prespecified subgroup analyses, including bevacizumab pretreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response rate was 19.8% (95% CI, 16.4% to 23.2%) with aflibercept plus FOLFIRI compared with 11.1% (95% CI, 8.5% to 13.8%) with placebo plus FOLFIRI (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects reported with aflibercept combined with FOLFIRI included the characteristic anti-vascular endothelial growth factor effects and also reflected an increased incidence of some chemotherapy-related toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI conferred a statistically significant survival benefit over FOLFIRI combined with placebo in patients with mCRC previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
