<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several randomized trials have indicated that combination chemotherapy applied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) does not significantly improve overall survival when compared to the sequential use of cytotoxic agents (CAIRO, MRC Focus, FFCD 2000-05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the question whether this statement holds true also for bevacizumab-based first-line treatment including escalation- and de-escalation strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The AIO KRK 0110/ML22011 trial is a two-arm, multicenter, open-label randomized phase III trial comparing the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus bevacizumab (Cape-Bev) versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus irinotecan plus bevacizumab (CAPIRI-Bev) in the first-line treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1, will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1250 mg/m(2) bid for 14d (d1-14) plus bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg (d1) q3w (Arm A) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 800 mg/m(2) BID for 14d (d1-14), irinotecan 200 mg/m(2) (d1) and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg (d1) q3w (Arm B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients included into this trial are required to consent to the analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue and blood for translational investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Arm A, treatment escalation from Cape-Bev to CAPIRI-Bev is recommended in case of progressive disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Arm B, de-escalation from CAPIRI-Bev to Cape-Bev is possible after 6 months of treatment or in case of irinotecan-associated toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Re-escalation to CAPIRI-Bev after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is time to failure of strategy (TFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints are overall response rate (ORR), overall survival, progression-free survival, safety and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The AIO KRK 0110 trial is designed for patients with disseminated, but asymptomatic mCRC who are not potential candidates for surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two bevacizumab-based strategies are compared: one starting as single-agent chemotherapy (Cape-Bev) allowing escalation to CAPIRI-Bev and another starting with combination chemotherapy (CAPIRI-Bev) and allowing de-escalation to Cape-Bev and subsequent re-escalation if necessary </plain></SENT>
