<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine this association in a large population-based cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 72,374 men and women who were diagnosed with stages I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at age ≥65 years from 1991 through 2002 from 16 regions in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program who were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> at baseline with up to 17 years of follow-up and also studied 15,921 matched cohorts based on the propensity of receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at 5 years was 16.2 cases per 1,000 persons for the chemotherapy group and 12.4 cases per 1,000 persons for the no chemotherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, patients who received chemotherapy were 24% significantly more likely to develop drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> compared to those without chemotherapy after adjusting for patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significantly increased risk was only observed in those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorder</z:e> who received chemotherapy in the entire cohort (1.26, 1.06-1.50) and in the matched cohort (1.29, 1.04-1.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> was significantly lower in patients receiving chemotherapy compared to those without chemotherapy regardless of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorder</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there was a significant association between chemotherapy and the risk of developing drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorder</z:e>, but chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
