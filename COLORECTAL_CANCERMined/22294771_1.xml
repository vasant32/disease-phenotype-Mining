<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case-control study, DNA damage and nucleotide excision repair capacity (NER-DRC) were assessed in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both parameters were quantified by comet assay in blood cells of 70 untreated incident patients and 70 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and polymorphisms in relevant NER genes were concurrently analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients for NER-DRC and to clarify possible relations between investigated variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comet assay and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients differ in repair capacity as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had a lower NER-DRC and simultaneously they exhibited higher endogenous DNA damage (for both P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of DNA damage and decreasing NER-DRC behaved as independent modulating parameters strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of 6 out of 9 studied genes differed between groups (P â‰¤ 0.001), but none of them was related to DRC or to any of the studied NER polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in patients only, XPC Ala499Val modulated expression levels of XPC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268136" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="XPBC">XPB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> gene, whereas XPC Lys939Gln was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268135" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPA</z:e> expression level in controls (for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further, alterations in a complex multigene process like DNA repair may be better characterized by functional quantification of repair capacity than by quantification of individual genes transcripts or gene variants alone </plain></SENT>
