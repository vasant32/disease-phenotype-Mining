<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Despite the availability of several active combination regimens for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), the 5-year survival rate remains poor at less than 10%, supporting the development of novel therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focused on the preclinical assessment of a rationally based combination against KRAS-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by testing the combination of the MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, and vorinostat, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Transcriptional profiling and gene set enrichment analysis (baseline and posttreatment) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines provided the rationale for the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of selumetinib and vorinostat against the KRAS-mutant SW620 and SW480 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines was studied in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of this combination on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> phenotype were assessed using monolayer and 3-dimensional cultures, flow cytometry, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibition, (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (FDG-PET), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance were carried out to evaluate the growth inhibitory and metabolic responses, respectively, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro, treatment with selumetinib and vorinostat resulted in a synergistic inhibition of proliferation and spheroid formation in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This inhibition was associated with an increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell-cycle arrest in G(1), and reduced cellular migration and VEGF-A secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, the combination resulted in additive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The metabolic response to selumetinib and vorinostat consisted of significant inhibition of membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>; no significant changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake or metabolism were observed in any of the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the rationally based combination of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor, selumetinib, with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat results in synergistic antiproliferative activity against KRAS-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In vivo, the combination showed additive effects that were associated with metabolic changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> turnover, but not on FDG-PET, indicating that the former is a more sensitive endpoint of the combination effects </plain></SENT>
