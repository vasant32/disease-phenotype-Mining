<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine the occurrence of new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with an SSA over a 5-year follow-up interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a retrospective chart review of patients with SSAs diagnosed at colonoscopy in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abstracted information included patient demographics, colonoscopy information, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 2005, 34 SSAs and 5 mixed SSAs were identified in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 66 years and 58% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 45%, prior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in 33%, and previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean SSA size was 11 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SSAs were located proximal to the splenic flexure in 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was present in 3% of SSAs and 80% mixed SSAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Synchronous adenomatous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> occurred respectively in 45% and 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was present in 12% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients underwent subsequent colonoscopies with 20 new SSAs and 1 mixed SSA identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In SSAs low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> occurred in 10% and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was present in the mixed SSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Synchronous adenomatous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> occurred respectively in 45% and 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was present in 10% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> occurred in 1 (5%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SSAs occurred more frequently in females and in the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> occurred in a small subset of SSAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There was a high rate of prior and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with SSAs </plain></SENT>
