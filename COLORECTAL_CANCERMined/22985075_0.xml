<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 2009 National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Program Quality Working Group report revealed that small rural towns in inner regional Victoria, Australia, for example Echuca (Rural and Remote Metropolitan Areas [RRMA] 4), registered 10.5 colonoscopies per 1000 population versus 18.5 per 1000 in the state capital Melbourne </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reasons for this discrepancy include lack of skilled practitioners in rural communities and travel time for patients to attend larger centres when the required bowel preparation or mobility issues limit access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ideally, services are high quality, safe and local </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the quality and safety of a rural GP colonoscopy service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The indications, findings, caecal intubation rates, complications and completion time were recorded for 3000 serial colonoscopies performed by one rural procedural GP from 1995 to 2011 in Victorian Echuca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quality was assessed using caecal intubation rate, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> detection rates, and completion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Safety was determined by complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The caecal intubation rate was 97% (excluding stenosing lesions), polypectomy detection rate was 39%, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> detection rate was 2%, and the average time to completion was 17 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Re-admission rates were 1.6/1000 for haemorrhage and 1.2/1000 for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study compare favourably with published international standards, validate Australian general practice procedural training standards, and validate the additional quality measure of 'colonoscopy completion time' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rural GPs can provide a safe and high quality service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Extending this service model to similar settings could improve reduced access to colonoscopy for rural Australians </plain></SENT>
