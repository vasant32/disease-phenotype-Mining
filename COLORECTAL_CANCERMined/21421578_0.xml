<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Application of the health literacy framework (HLF) to immigrant populations has been limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to apply the HLF to discourses about diet-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> prevention among English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) immigrant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also explored whether these discussions could inform the development of culturally appropriate information and potentially increase health literacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interviews were conducted with 64 older Spanish-speaking ESL immigrant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Directed content analysis guided by the HLF was used to identify themes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diet-related conversations were initiated by 43 (67%) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four themes were identified: general information requests-low functional health literacy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHL</z:e>) (n = 23/43), specific nutrition inquiries-high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHL</z:e> (n = 17/43), actions for healthy eating-low interactive health literacy (IHL) (n = 8/43) and community communication issues-high IHL (n = 3/43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No conversations representing critical health literacy were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five women discussed both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHL</z:e> and IHL themes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Women's diet-related conversations followed a continuum of increasing information needs supporting the HLF </plain></SENT>
