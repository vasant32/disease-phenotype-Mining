<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported outcomes-although important in the palliative setting-have not been reported in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a phase 3 trial (n = 463), patients with chemotherapy-refractory mCRC were randomized 1:1 to panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29308,30347">NCCN</z:chebi>/FACT <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Symptom Index (FCSI) and EQ-5D Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status was analyzed in a prospectively defined, retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average difference in change from baseline between treatment groups was evaluated using linear mixed and pattern-mixture models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status and post-baseline patient-reported outcomes were available for 363 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear mixed models indicated significant differences in the FCSI score (difference in least-squares [LS] adjusted means [95% CI]; 5.62 [2.38, 8.86]) and the EQ-5D Index (difference in LS adjusted means [95% CI]; 0.22 [0.12, 0.32]) favoring panitumumab over BSC in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By pattern-mixture analysis, the advantage of panitumumab over BSC was more pronounced in those patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC who did not drop out of the study early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with mutant KRAS mCRC, no differences were observed between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab-treated patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC maintained better control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> symptoms and quality of life compared with BSC alone, extending our understanding of the benefits of panitumumab treatment beyond improvements in progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
