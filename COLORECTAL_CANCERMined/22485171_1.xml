<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Gastroenteropancreatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_366'>neuroendocrine tumors</z:mpath> (GEP-NETs) are rare group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a wide spectrum of clinical behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no known clinically relevant biomarkers to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To investigate differential gene expression signatures of metastatic vs non-metastatic NETs, we studied cell cycle regulatory genes in 19 metastatic and 22 non-metastatic colorectal NETs by PCR arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR were performed to verify the results and another set of 38 GEP-NETs were further studied for validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We first delineated six candidate genes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> including ATM, CCND2, RBL2, CDKN3, CCNB1, and GTSE1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ATM was negatively correlated with metastatic NETs (p&lt;0.001) with more than 2-fold change compared to non-metastatic NETs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of ATM protein by IHC was strongly correlated with high ATM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and low Ki-67 labeling index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with ATM-negativity by IHC showed significantly decreased overall survival than patients with ATM-positivity (median OS, metastatic vs non-metastatic NETs; 2.7 years vs not reached; p = 0.003) and 85.7% of metastatic NETs were ATM-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In another validation set of GEP-NETs, decreased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of ATM gene was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and remained significant (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ATM down-regulation was strongly associated with metastatic NETs when compared with non-metastatic NETs and ATM may be a potential predictive marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> as well as a novel target in metastatic GEP-NETs </plain></SENT>
