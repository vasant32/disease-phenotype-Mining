<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Qualitative study with eight focus groups comprised of participants and non-participants in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programme in Valencia (Spain), structural sample design and discursive analysis by gender, SES and participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-participants and those with lower SES tended to have less knowledge about both the disease and the programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reasons for participation varied according to gender: women were motivated because they value the importance of self-care and early detection in order to prevent personal and family suffering while men were encouraged by their partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reasons for non-participation were also influenced by gender: women feared the results and considered the test unpleasant whereas men showed carelessness and lack of concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In population-based programmes, people with lower SES and men are those with the most obstacles to participation due to low health literacy and traditional gender roles respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To increase participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programmes based on informed decision making and taking into account social inequalities, information should be more accessible, comprehensible and adapted to gender and SES differences and emphasise the greater vulnerability of men for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the benefits of early detection </plain></SENT>
