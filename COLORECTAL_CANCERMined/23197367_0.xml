<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> unequivocally comprise the major biomolecules involved in extracellular processes, such as growth factors, signaling proteins for cellular communication, enzymes, and proteases for on- and off-site processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is now known that altered protein glycosylation is a hallmark event in many different pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">Glycoproteins</z:chebi> are found mostly in the so-called secretome, which comprises classically and nonclassically secreted proteins and protein fragments that are released from the cell surface through ectodomain shedding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to biological complexity and technical difficulty, comparably few studies have taken an in-depth investigation of cellular secretomes using system-wide approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cellular secretomes are considered to be a valuable source of therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is not surprising that many existing biomarkers, including biomarkers for breast, ovarian, prostate, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Focused analysis of secreted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> could thus provide valuable information for early disease diagnosis, and surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since most secreted proteins are glycosylated and glycosylation predominantly targets secreted proteins, the glycan/sugar moiety itself can be used as a chemical "handle" for the targeted analysis of cellular secretomes, thereby reducing sample complexity and allowing detection of low abundance proteins in proteomic workflows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on various <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> enrichment strategies that facilitate proteomics-based technologies for the quantitative analysis of cell secretomes and cell surface proteomes </plain></SENT>
