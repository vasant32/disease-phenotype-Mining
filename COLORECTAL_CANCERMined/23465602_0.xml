<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survival rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have doubled in the last 30 years and it is now curable if diagnosed early, but still over half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sufferers do not survive for longer than 5 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major complication to treating this disease is that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, specifically to the liver, which is associated with a 5 year survival of less than 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These statistics highlight the importance of the development of earlier detection techniques and more targeted therapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The future of treating this disease therefore lies in increasing understanding of the mutations which cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumourigenesis</z:e>, and insight into the development and progression of this complex disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This can only be achieved through the use of functional models which recapitulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of the human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a wide range of models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> available to researchers, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have their own strengths and weaknesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we review how <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> can be modelled and discuss the future of modelling this complex disease, with a particular focus on how genetically engineered mouse models have revolutionised this area of research </plain></SENT>
