<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To digitally analyze expression levels of multiple genes in one reaction, we proposed a method termed as 'MDHB' (Multiplexed Digital-PCR coupled with Hydrogel Bead-array) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The template for bead-based emulsion PCR (emPCR) was prepared by reverse transcription using sequence-tagged primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The beads recovered from emPCR were immobilized with hydrogel to form a single-bead layer on a chip, and then decoded by gene-specific probe hybridization and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37990">Cy3</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> based primer extension reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specificity of probe hybridization was improved by using electrophoresis to remove mismatched probes on the bead's surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of positive beads reflects the abundance of expressed genes; the expression levels of target genes were normalized to a housekeeping gene and expressed as the number ratio of green beads to red beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The discrimination limit of MDHB is 0.1% (i.e., one target molecule from 1000 background molecules), and the sensitivity of the method is below 100 cells when using the Î²-actin gene as the detection target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have successfully employed MDHB to detect the relative expression levels of four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>)-related genes (c-myc, COX-2, MMP7, and DPEP1) in 8 tissue samples and 9 stool samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, giving the detection rates of 100% and 77%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that MDHB could be a potential tool for early non-invasive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
