<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Gimeracil, an inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), partially inhibits homologous recombination (HR) repair and has a radiosensitizing effect as well as enhanced sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">Camptothecin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DPYD is the target protein for radiosensitization by Gimeracil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the mechanisms of sensitization of radiation and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> by DPYD inhibition using DLD-1 cells treated with siRNA for DPYD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the focus formation of various kinds of proteins involved in HR and examined the phosphorylation of RPA by irradiation using Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DPYD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> by siRNA significantly restrained the formation of radiation-induced foci of Rad51 and RPA, whereas it increased the number of foci of NBS1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of colocalization of NBS1 and RPA foci in DPYD-depleted cells after radiation were significantly smaller than in the control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DPYD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> is attributable to decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> generated by the Mre11/Rad50/NBS1 complex-dependent resection of DNA double-strand break ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of RPA by irradiation was partially suppressed in DPYD-depleted cells, suggesting that DPYD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> may partially inhibit DNA repair with HR by suppressing phosphorylation of RPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DPYD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> showed a radiosensitizing effect as well as enhanced sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The radiosensitizing effect of DPYD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> plus <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> was the additive effect of DPYD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DPYD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> did not have a cell-killing effect, suggesting that DPYD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> may not be so toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Considering these results, the combination of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> and drugs that inhibit DPYD may prove useful for radiotherapy as a method of radiosensitization </plain></SENT>
