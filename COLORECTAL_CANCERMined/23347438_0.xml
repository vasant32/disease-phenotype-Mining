<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to assess colorectal surgical practice in Australia and New Zealand with respect to management of young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the impact of family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to members of the Colorectal Surgical Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSSANZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survey assessed the clinical practice of the respondent and utilized scenario-based questions to investigate their clinical approach to patients under 50 years who develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with respect to management and surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colorectal society trainees, members and fellows were also questioned on a scenario of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> and no vertical transmission, and which operation they would perform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 189 surveys sent out, 114 respondents completed the survey (60.3%) with 99 (86.8%) respondents practicing colorectal surgeons and 13.2% (15) CSSANZ trainees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent of respondents had a practice with greater than 70% colorectal work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the surgeons and trainees, 92.1% (105) would perform a limited resection in a young patient with a right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six percent altered the approach if there was a first-degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and 68% altered the approach if the family history fulfilled criteria for hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 22.8% of respondents could recognize potential MutYH-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> with moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> and absence of vertical transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Colorectal surgeons in Australia will modify their management of patients under 50 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> based on a family history and risk of inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further education could improve management </plain></SENT>
