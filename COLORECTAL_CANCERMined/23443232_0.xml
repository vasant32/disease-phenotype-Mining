<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To characterize aberrant crypt focus (ACF) in adjoining mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and to evaluate fragile histidine triad (Fhit) protein and Ki67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ACF was identified grossly and classified histologically in 75 resected specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ACF was typed into hyperplastic ACF (HACF) and dysplastic ACF (DACF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sections of ACF, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa as control were studied for Fhit and Ki67 expressions by immunohistochemistry and were grouped according to staining intensity and the number of positive stained cells observed in different histological groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison was done between the different groups by Pearson's χ(2) test and γ test for the ordinal data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P value &lt; 0.05 was considered as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age range was 40 to 86 years in males (mean = 43.36) and 45 to 70 years in females (mean = 56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HACF was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studied in the non-tumorous colonic mucosa; ACF was observed as non-contiguous scattered foci, which supports the hypothesis of acquisition of single focus monoclonality by colonic epithelial cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four (32%) had DACF and were observed as closure to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intensity of Fhit expression: (1) HACF - 40% exhibited strong intensity, similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, moderate in 36% and weak in 24%; (2) DACF - strong in 25%, moderate in 37.5% and weak in 37.5%; and (3) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> - negative in 16%, strong in 43% and moderate and weak in 28.5% each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant difference was observed in intensity of the Fhit protein expressions by HACF and DACF (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> in older patients showed a stronger Fhit intensity compared to younger patients (P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vegetarian diet intake and non-smokers showed stronger Fhit intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, non-vegetarian diet and younger age was associated with loss of Fhit protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ki67 positivity was an extended crypt pattern in HACF and DACF showed extension up to the neck region of the crypts and surface epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinomas</z:mp> showed a marked increase in Ki67 expression (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Fhit protein had an inverse association with Ki67 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Weaker Fhit intensity was associated with smoking, non-vegetarian diet intake and increasing Ki67 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Loss of Fhit protein expression is possibly influenced by environmental factors like smoking and non-vegetarian diet intake </plain></SENT>
