<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Society of Pathology have previously developed a national electronic template for histopathology reporting on colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate (1) whether quality routines in Norwegian pathology laboratories might affect completeness of such histopathology reports and (2) whether the national electronic template improves completeness of histopathology reports compared with other modes of reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire on quality routines was sent to the 21 pathology laboratories in Norway </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 20 laboratories that handled resection specimens, 16 had written guidelines on histopathology reporting </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quality routines in the pathology laboratories clearly governed reporting practice and the completeness of the histopathology reports </plain></SENT>
