<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells exhibit increased glycolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression has been reported to be associated with resistance to therapeutic agents and a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wondered whether GLUT1 expression was associated with the clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and whether glycolysis inhibition could represent a novel anticancer treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual cancer</z:e> cells using microdissection from a total of 52 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens from patients who underwent preoperative CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed transcriptional analyzes, and studied the association of the GLUT1 gene expression levels with the clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined each proliferative response of three selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines to a glycolysis inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvic acid (3-BrPA), with regard to their expression of the GLUT1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An elevated GLUT1 gene expression was associated with a high postoperative stage, the presence of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and distant recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, elevated GLUT1 gene expression independently predicted both the recurrence-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro studies, we observed that 3-BrPA significantly suppressed the proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with high GLUT1 gene expression, compared with those with low expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An elevated GLUT1 expression may be a useful predictor of distant recurrence and poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients after preoperative CRT </plain></SENT>
