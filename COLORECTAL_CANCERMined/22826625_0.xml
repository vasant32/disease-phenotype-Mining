<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients or relatives attending the clinics or health care workers working in a tertiary center were invited to participate in this questionnaire study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire enquired on the general demographics (1) age, gender, ethnicity, education level, and employment status, previous history of colonoscopy, family or personal history of colonic pathologies, personal and family history of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; (2) subjects were asked if they would go for an SC if they had appropriate indications (age over 50 years, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), fecal occult blood positive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> per rectum with or without loss of appetite, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>) with and without symptoms attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; and (3) preferences for the gender of the endoscopists and assistants and whether they would still undergo SC even if their preferences were not met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-four point seven percent (470/550) completed questionnaire were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More female subjects expressed gender preferences for the endoscopists [overall 70%; female (67.7%) and male (2.3%)] compared to male subjects [overall 62.8%; male (56%) and female (6.8%), P = 0.102] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, more female subjects expressed gender preferences for the assistants [overall 74.5%; female (73.4%) and male (1.1%)] compared to male subjects [overall 58%, male (49.3%) and female (8.7%), P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, a third would decline an SC, despite having appropriate indications, if their preferences were not met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, male gender, non-Malay ethnicity (Chinese and others) and previous colonoscopy experience were more likely to undergo an SC, even if their preferences were not met (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gender and previous experience [odds ratio (OR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-2.82, P &lt; 0.05] with colonoscopy (OR 4.70, 95% CI 1.41-15.66, P &lt; 0.05) remained significant on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Genders preference for the endoscopy nurses/assistants is more common than for the endoscopist among women and has implications for the success of a screening colonoscopy program </plain></SENT>
