<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES:: To assess patterns of failure and factors affecting recurrence patterns in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with Y-labeled resin microspheres for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: We retrospectively reviewed 30 colorectal patients treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">Yttrium</z:chebi>-90 radioembolization and assessed follow-up computed tomography scans and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography scans to determine disease outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were included in survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> were assessed for patterns of failure after radioembolization treatment and grouped into 3 patterns: (1) hepatic; (2) extrahepatic; and (3) intrahepatic and extrahepatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The median overall survival and progression-free survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colorectal patients treated with radioembolization was 9.4 and 3.2 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and progression-free survival were not significantly different between patterns of failure (P=0.43 and 0.26, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a trend toward the predictive value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume in determining patterns of failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volumes had a higher predictive probability for extrahepatic failure than larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volumes (P=0.057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> volumes &lt;300 mL were predictive for extrahepatic failure patterns compared with hepatic recurrence (P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Radioembolization with Y-labeled resin microspheres continues to be an effective salvage treatment for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of patterns of radiologic failure demonstrated that patients treated by radioembolization develop a greater proportion of extrahepatic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> volumes &gt;300 mL were predictive for hepatic recurrence, suggesting that increased dosing or retreatment of these lesions may lead to improved hepatic control of disease and better patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
