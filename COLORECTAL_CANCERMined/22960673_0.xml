<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic review of the literature was also carried out to analyze the factors influencing the results of SEMS placement and to determine if there has been any improvement in the more recent period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of a personal series of 100 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no case of mortality or major morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The systematic review included 27 articles published from April 2007 to December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our experience the technical success rate was 96% and the clinical success rate was 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period a repeat colonoscopy was needed in 31% of the patients for recurrent symptoms of obstruction due to fecal impaction (19%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> (8%), or stent dislodgment (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Review of the literature showed similar results, with a significant improvement in the reports of the last 6 years; procedures performed on an emergency basis had poorer results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-expandable metallic stent placement offers a valid alternative to surgery in patients with obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e>, but careful follow-up is required </plain></SENT>
