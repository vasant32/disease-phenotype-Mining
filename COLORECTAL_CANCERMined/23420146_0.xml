<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both FDG PET and FDG PET/CT are superior when compared to CT alone for the purpose of recurrence detection in patients suffering from <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinoma</z:mp> who have completed primary therapy but demonstrate a rising serum CA-125 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the global accuracy of CT alone for detection of recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> approximates 80%, CT scan should be performed upfront to identify the site of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When confronted with negative or equivocal CT findings, FDG PET alone or FDG PET/CT should be added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with rising serum CEA levels that have undergone primary treatment for a colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, both FDG PET and FDG PET/CT allow detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence with an accuracy of 95%, well above that of CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Available studies further suggest that FDG/PET findings will affect treatment management in 28-50% of these patients </plain></SENT>
