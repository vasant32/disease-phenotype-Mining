<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Receptor tyrosine kinases are a diverse family of transmembrane proteins that can activate multiple pathways upon ligation of the receptor, one of which is the series of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MAPK pathways play critical roles in a wide variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types, from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrations include altered expression levels and activation states of pathway components, which can sometimes be attributable to mutations in individual members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The V600E mutation of BRAF was initially described in 2002 and has been found at particularly high frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and certain subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the relatively short time since this discovery, a family of drugs has been developed that specifically target this mutated BRAF isoform, which, after results from phase I/II and III clinical trials, was granted U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Food and Drug Administration approval in August 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although these drugs produce clinically meaningful increases in progression-free and overall survival, due to acquired resistance they have not improved mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New drugs targeting other members of the MAPK pathways are in clinical trials or advanced stages of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that combination therapies of these new drugs in conjunction with BRAF inhibitors will counteract the mechanisms of resistance and provide cures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical implementation of next-generation sequencing is leading to a greater understanding of the genetic architecture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, along with acquired mechanisms of drug resistance, which will guide the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific inhibitors and combination therapies in the future </plain></SENT>
