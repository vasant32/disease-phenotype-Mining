<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further understanding of the translation of DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> into protein expression will help to define novel biomarkers to improve therapies and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA ploidy was assessed by image cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of gel-electrophoresis-based protein expression patterns of three diploid and four aneuploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines detected 64 ploidy-associated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis resulting in two overlapping high-ranked networks maintaining Cellular Assembly and Organization, Cell Cycle, and Cellular Growth and Proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAPZA1, TXNL1, and HDAC2 were significantly validated by Western blotting in cell lines and the latter two showed expression differences also in clinical samples using a tissue microarray of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (n=19), diploid (n=31), and aneuploid (n=47) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that distinct protein expression patterns, affecting TXNL1 and HDAC2, distinguish aneuploid with poor prognosis from diploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
