<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Because of some inconsistencies in the traditional model of human colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi>) model was recently proposed, in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> results from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> of stem cells, which become <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> by expression of surface antigens remains a critical issue because no biomarker has been shown to be completely reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD133 and CD44 are commonly used as <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> markers, and correlation of their expression with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) clinicopathological features and outcomes may be useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty-six consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD133 and CD44 expression (alone or combined) was determined in nontumor cells and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells by flow cytometry, which identified viable cells only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Correlation of CD133 and CD44 expression with each other, with other prognostic indicators, and with disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD133 and CD44 expression was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells than in nontumor cells, and expression of one did not necessarily correlate with expression of the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD133 or CD44 expression alone was variable, while combined CD133/CD44 expression identified a small subset of cells positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD133 or CD44 overexpression was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence; only high frequencies of CD133(+)/CD44(+) cells were a strong indicator of worse disease-free survival and an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Evaluation of combined CD133/CD44 expression could be useful to identify putative colorectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
