<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who received bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between results of platelet count, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, and D-Dimer obtained at baseline and on day 1 of chemotherapy cycles 4, 8, and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CFT value was significantly increased on day 1 of cycle 12 compared with baseline value by both INTEM and EXTEM assays while CT and MCF showed no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between laboratory parameters and ROTEM(®) parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet count showed a positive correlation with MCF in INTEM (r = 0.627) and EXTEM (r = 0.699) assays while showed a negative correlation with CFT in EXTEM (r = -603) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between fibrinogen levels and CFT in INTEM (r = -0.617) and EXTEM (r = -0.512) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated the value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44926">TEG</z:chebi> over conventional coagulation tests in evaluating antiangiogenesis agents-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
