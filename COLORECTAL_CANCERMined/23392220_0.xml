<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients and Methods: Forty-eight patients were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received an alternating regimen of 4 cycles of mFOLFOX6 followed by 4 cycles of FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: The characteristics of the study population were as follows: males/females 34/12, median age 66 years (range 43-75) and Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status 0/1/2 in 37/9/0 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 58.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 43.9-73.5] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% CI 7.5-11.9), and the median overall survival was 28.4 months (95% CI 22.5-35.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 47 patients evaluated for toxicity, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (26%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (55%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (4%), neurotoxicity (0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (2%), febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (2%), and hypersensitivity (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The results of this phase II study indicate that this alternating schedule is effective and well tolerated as a first-line treatment for unresectable or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The low rate of grade 3 neurotoxicity is also promising </plain></SENT>
