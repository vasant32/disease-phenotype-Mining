<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Previously untreated patients with assessable disease were treated with mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab until <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, followed by FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of the study was the second progression-free survival (2nd PFS), defined as duration from enrollment until progression after the second-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints of the study were overall survival (OS), survival beyond first progression (SBP), progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first-line setting, 47 patients treated with mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab achieved RR of 61.7 %, DCR of 89.4 %, and median PFS of 13.1 months (95 % CI, 8.7-17.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients went on to receive a second-line therapy with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab and achieved RR of 27.6 %, DCR of 62.1 %, and median PFS of 7.3 months (95 % CI, 5.0-9.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median 2nd PFS was 18.0 months (95 % CI, 13.7-22.3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median OS and SBP were 30.8 months (95 % CI, 27.6-34.0 months) and 19.6 months (95 % CI, 13.5-25.7 months), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No critical events associated with bevacizumab were observed during the second-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The planned continuation of bevacizumab during a second-line treatment, BBP strategy, is feasible for the Japanese mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
