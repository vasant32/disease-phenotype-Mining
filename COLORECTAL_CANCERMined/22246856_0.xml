<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent study that used massively parallel whole exome sequencing identified an activating V600E mutation in BRAF, which appeared specific for HCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we confirm the specificity of BRAF V600E for HCL among low and intermediate grade B-NHL and describe a real-time polymerase chain reaction method for detecting this mutation in cases with low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The V600E mutation does not appear to be associated with microsatellite instability, unlike the case in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, in conjunction with prior data, our results suggest incorporation of BRAF V600E mutation analysis in the diagnostic workup of HCL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, targeting the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk-Map kinase pathway should be investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
