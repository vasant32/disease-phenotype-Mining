<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Network pharmacology has emerged as a new topic of study in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It aims to study the myriad relationships among proteins, drugs, and disease phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concept of molecular connectivity maps has been proposed to establish comprehensive knowledge links between molecules of interest in a given biological context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular connectivity maps between drugs and genes/proteins in specific disease contexts can be particularly valuable, since the functional approach with these maps helps researchers gain global perspectives on both the therapeutic profiles and toxicological profiles of candidate drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess drug pharmacological effect, we assume that "ideal" drugs for a patient can treat or prevent the disease by modulating gene expression profiles of this patient to the similar level with those in healthy people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Starting from this hypothesis, we build comprehensive disease-gene-drug connectivity relationships with drug-protein directionality (inhibit/activate) information based on a computational connectivity maps (C²Maps) platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An interactive interface for directionality annotation of drug-protein pairs with literature evidences from PubMed has been added to the new version of C²Maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also upload the curated directionality information of drug-protein pairs specific for three complex diseases - <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For relevant drug-protein pairs with directionality information, we use <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> as a case study to demonstrate the functionality of disease-specific searching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the results obtained from searching, we perform pharmacological effect evaluation for two important <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> drugs on treating patients diagnosed with different <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The evaluation is performed on a well-studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> gene expression microarray dataset to portray how useful the updated C²Maps is in assessing drug efficacy and toxicity information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The C²Maps platform is an online bioinformatics resource that provides biologists with directional relationships between drugs and genes/proteins in specific disease contexts based on network mining, literature mining, and drug effect annotating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A new insight to assess overall drug efficacy and toxicity can be provided by using the C²Maps platform to identify disease relevant proteins and drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The case study on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> correlates very well with the existing pharmacology of the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> drugs and highlights the significance of C²Maps database </plain></SENT>
