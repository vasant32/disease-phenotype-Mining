<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening to detect the disease in an early stage is the most effective approach to tackle this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, better diagnostic tools for assessment of prognosis and prediction of response to drug therapy will allow for personalized therapies and better outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein biomarkers that reflect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biology have the potential to address a wide range of clinical needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include diagnostic (screening) biomarkers for early detection, prognostic biomarkers for estimation of disease outcome, predictive biomarkers for adjuvant treatment stratification, and surveillance biomarkers for disease monitoring and treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An important source for the discovery of potential biomarkers comes from mass spectrometry based proteomics research of the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we review recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> proteomics studies directed at identification of biomarker proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These include studies that use preclinical models (i.e. cell lines or murine tissues) as well as clinical materials (e.g. tissue and stool samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We separately highlight some studies that focused on identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi>) related proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spheroids, an in vitro model system for investigating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent proteomics studies have generated many new candidate protein biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of follow-up studies that lead to biomarker verification and/or validation remains a limiting factor in the translation of these candidate biomarkers into clinical applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is partly due to technological limitations which are bound to diminish with new technologies, including selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Antibodies are still required, though, both to perform high-throughput validation as well as to develop cost-effective tests for routine use in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
