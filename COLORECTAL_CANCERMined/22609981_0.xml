<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine and compare the clinical outcome and safety of the Taewoong D-type uncovered stent and the Boston Scientific Wallfex stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235328" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic obstruction</z:e> were treated with a colonic stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of palliation, patients were randomly allocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of bridging, the type of stent was determined by the discretion of the individual doctors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Technical and clinical success and complication occurrence were measured as primary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 12 university hospitals, 123 patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235328" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic obstruction</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 123 patients, 58 were treated with colonic stents for palliative purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technical and clinical success rate was 100 % for both stents in the palliative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> occurred for one patient (3.6 %) in the Wallflex stent group (n = 28) on day 5 and for no patients in the D-type stent group (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two cases of migration occurred: one with the Wallflex stent and one with the D-type stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stent restenosis occurred for one patient with the Wallflex stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Preoperative bridging stents were placed in 65 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median time to surgery was 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 93.4 %, and clinical success was achieved for 86.2 % of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> occurred for five patients: four with the Wallflex stent and one with the D-type stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of the two stents did not differ statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The D-type colonic uncovered stent and the Wallflex colonic uncovered stent are effective and safe for both palliative and preoperative bridging therapy used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235328" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
