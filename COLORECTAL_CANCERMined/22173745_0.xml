<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> have been considered to be precursors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the biological and/or morphological changes which occur during the course of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight colorectal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> including five mixed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (MP) from 20 patients were observed by chromoendoscopy with magnification, and subsequently resected endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of mutations in two genes (K-ras and BRAF) and the methylation status of six genes (MLH1-A, MLH1-C, ESR1, P16, SOCS1, and IGFBP7) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 28 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> included 32 histological serrated lesions (22 sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> [SSA], six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> [HP], and four traditional serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> [TSA]-like lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation was frequently observed in SSAs (19/22), while K-ras mutation was dominant in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> (5/6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The externalization of saw-tooth architecture in serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was endoscopically observed more frequently in those with high levels of IGFBP7 methylation (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the endoscopic finding was observed in five of six small serrated lesions (&lt;10 mm) which contained both BRAF mutation and high levels of IGFBP7 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TSA-like lesions in small MPs demonstrated the endoscopic finding with no or little MLH1 methylation, while the counterparts in the mixed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> had high levels of MLH1 methylation with relatively low levels of IGFBP7 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests two distinct pathways may be involved in the early stages of the serrated pathway: one where MLH1 is primarily methylated, and a second where methylated IGFBP7 is associated with an externalization of saw-tooth architecture </plain></SENT>
