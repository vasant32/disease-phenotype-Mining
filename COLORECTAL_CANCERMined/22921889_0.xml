<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine specific imaging features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, focusing on the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 2-year period, 79 hepatic metastatic lesions were identified from 32 patients (22 men and 10 women) who proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3.0T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Hepatic metastases</z:e> were proven pathologically in 16 patients: by surgical liver resection (n=14) and by US-guided biopsy (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 16 patients were considered to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> based on imaging studies and clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists evaluated the imaging features of each MRI sequence, including high resolution T2WI, dynamic contrast enhancement study with hepatobiliary phase, and diffusion weighted image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also compared SI of the lesions on T2WI and HBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T2WI showed homogeneous high SI (n=25; 31.7%), target appearance (n=3; 3.8%), reversed target appearance (n=2; 2.6%), and heterogeneously high SI (n=49; 62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On HBP, homogeneous defect were seen in 22 lesions (27.9%), target appearance in five lesions (6.4%), reversed target appearance in two lesions (2.5%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> defect in 50 lesions (63.3%); including reticular (70%), partially globular (26%), and diffuse GGO-like (4%) patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the imaging features on HBP, the homogeneous defect and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> defect groups had a mean <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value of 0.99 × 10(-3) and 1.07 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s, respectively, without statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Hepatic metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> usually showed as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> defect on HBP and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> high SI on T2WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The generally accepted "true defect" was not a common finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
