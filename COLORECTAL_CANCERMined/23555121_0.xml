<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Every year, nearly 1 million new cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are recognized around the world and nearly half of them lose their lives due to the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The statistics reveal shocking incidence and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, therefore secondary prevention of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is important and research has shown that by early diagnosis 90% of patients can be treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests, fecal occult blood test (FOBT) takes the priority because of its convenience and also low cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But due to various reasons, the participation of people in this screening test is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to assess the factors that affect participation of population at average risk in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programs, based on health belief model structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 196 individuals, more than 50 years old, was conducted in Isfahan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight people of the target group were selected from laboratories while they came there for doing FOBT test; the method of sampling in this group was random sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The method of data collection in the other 98 individuals was by home interview and they were selected by cluster sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire used was based on health belief model to assess the factors associated with performing FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean score of knowledge in the first group was 48/5 ± 11/7 and in the second group was 36/5 ± 19/3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Individuals in the first group were more likely to be married, had more years of schooling, and better financial status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were significant relationships between knowledge (P&lt;0.001), perceived susceptibility (P&lt;0.001), perceived severity (P&lt;0.001), perceived barriers (P&lt;0.001), and self-efficacy (P&lt;0.001) in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between the perceived benefits in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Those people who have had FOBT test in last year in each group reported better score of Health Belief Model model structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to this study, it seems that there is an urgent need to pay more attention to this disease and its prevention through screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>With a better understanding of factors affecting the test, it can be a useful step to reduce the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and costs, and improve the community health outcomes </plain></SENT>
