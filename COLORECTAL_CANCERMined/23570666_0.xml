<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, physiological conditions and the operation may also influence survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the impact of the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity (POSSUM) and the colorectal version (CR-POSSUM) on the long-term survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Prospectively collected data were included of consecutive patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> resection during 2000 - 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the POSSUM and CR-POSSUM scores and the physiological components with outcomes and survivals were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 343 patients (196 males, 263 open resections, 74 laparoscopic resections, 6 local resections) with a mean follow-up of 56.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients had had neoadjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> and 115 had adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their median POSSUM score was 34 (interquartile range 31 - 39) and the median CR-POSSUM score was 19 (interquartile range 18 - 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Log rank test showed a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in long-term survival for patients who belonged to different score groups of POSSUM and physiological component of the POSSUM system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors found on multivariate analysis to have significant association with long-term survival included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TMN</z:e> stage, perineural invasion, local invasion, obstruction, emergency operation, POSSUM score and physiological score of POSSUM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mortality of patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> surgery can be predicted by POSSUM, P-POSSUM or CR-POSSUM with no significant difference between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both POSSUM and physiological score of POSSUM were significantly related with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The POSSUM score was one of the factors that independently predicted long-term survival </plain></SENT>
