<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As most of these risk variants reside outside the coding regions of genes, we conducted cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) analyses to investigate possible regulatory functions on the expression of neighboring genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty microsatellite stable and CpG island methylator phenotype-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> and paired adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues were used for genome-wide SNP and gene expression profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that three risk variants (rs10795668, rs4444235 and rs9929218, using near perfect proxies rs706771, rs11623717 and rs2059252, respectively) were significantly associated (FDR q-value ≤0.05) with expression levels of nearby genes (&lt;2 Mb up- or down-stream) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed an association between the low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk allele (A) for rs10795668 at 10p14 and increased expression of ATP5C1 (q = 0.024) and between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> high risk allele (C) for rs4444235 at 14q22.2 and increased expression of DLGAP5 (q = 0.041), both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> low risk allele (A) for rs9929218 at 16q22.1 was associated with a significant decrease in expression of both NOL3 (q = 0.017) and DDX28 (q = 0.046) in the adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the four genes, DLGAP5 and NOL3 have been previously reported to play a role in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and ATP5C1 and DDX28 are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteins involved in cellular metabolism and division, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of GWAS findings, prior functional studies, and the cis-eQTL analyses described here suggest putative functional activities for three of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> GWAS identified risk loci as regulating the expression of neighboring genes </plain></SENT>
