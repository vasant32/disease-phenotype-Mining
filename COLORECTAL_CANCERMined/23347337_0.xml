<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Side effects were usually managed by rural general practitioners locally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim is to determine the safety of this practice by comparing the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and rural patients at the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective audit was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal and node positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> during a 24 month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fisher exact test was used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rurality was determined as per rural, remote and metropolitan classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 121 patients included, 70 and 51 patients had breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The urban versus rural patient split amongst <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> subgroups was 68 vs 53, 43 vs 27 and 25 vs 26 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 421 cycles were given with dose intensity of &gt;95% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in both groups (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rate of febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was 9.3% vs 7.4% (p=0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For XELOX, rate of diarrhoea was 20% vs 19% (p=0.66) and rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> was 20% vs 11% (p=0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 2 patients were transferred to Townsville for admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Support for general practitioners via phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns </plain></SENT>
