<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with abnormal expression of p53 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, but this relationship has not been evaluated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was evaluated to determine if SES is associated with abnormal p53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 249 patients who underwent curative or palliative resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measures of SES and potential confounders were abstracted from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal nuclear accumulation of p53 (p53(nac)) was measured in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between low SES and p53(nac) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over half (56.2%) of the patients exhibited p53(nac) in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, the odds ratio for p53(nac) was 1.28 (95% CI =0.55, 2.99) for Medicaid patients relative to those without Medicaid coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the prevalence of p53(nac) and unemployment, private insurance coverage, or having Medicare due to disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The odds of having p53(nac) were 1.28 times higher for patients with Medicaid coverage, although these findings were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this pilot study, however, provide evidence of a molecular basis for the decreased survival of low SES patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
