<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The number of lymph nodes retrieved is recognized to be a prognostic factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage II colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic significance of the number of lymph nodes retrieved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relationship between the number of lymph nodes retrieved and clinical and pathological factors, and significance of the number of lymph nodes retrieved for prognosis of Stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 16 865 patients with T3/T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who had R0 resection were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The arithmetic mean of the number of lymph nodes retrieved of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was 20.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of lymph nodes retrieved were varied according to several clinical and pathological variables with significant difference, and the greater difference was observed in scope of nodal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival of Stages II and III was significantly associated with the number of lymph nodes retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival of the patients with â‰¤ 9 of the number of lymph nodes retrieved and those with &gt;27 differed by 6.4% for Stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, 8.8% for Stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, 12.5% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage II rectal cancer</z:e> and 10.6% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage III rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With one increase in the number of lymph nodes retrieved, the mortality risk was decreased by 2.1% for Stage II and by 0.8% for Stage III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cut-off point of the number of lymph nodes retrieved was not obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of lymph nodes retrieved was shown to be an important prognostic variable not only in Stage II but also in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage III colorectal cancer</z:e>, and it was most prominently determined by the scope of nodal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A cut-off value for the number of lymph nodes retrieved was not found, and it is necessary to carry out appropriate nodal dissection and examine as many lymph nodes as possible </plain></SENT>
