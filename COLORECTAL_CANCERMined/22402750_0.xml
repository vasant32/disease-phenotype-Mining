<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To explore experiences and support needs of people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with a focus on identifying opportunities for primary care interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a new qualitative analysis of an existing dataset, comprising semi-structured interview transcripts from 39 people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from across the UK, interviewed in 2001-2002 for www.healthtalkonline.org  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from North East Scotland and Glasgow in 2009 and analysed these new data to explore themes and challenge hypotheses that emerged from the Healthtalkonline data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Formal sources of support, including that from primary care, were valued by those who received them, but provision was described as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> both in 2002 and in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, more of the 2009 participants gave descriptions of specialist nurse and community nurse involvement, and telephone contact from general practitioners, which were welcomed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvements in meeting information needs, particularly on the issues of diet and sex, were identified by 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A recurring issue reported by patients was the distress experienced by their own friends and family; some patients found themselves having to provide, rather than receive, emotional support at this difficult time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There have been improvements in support for people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> since 2002, with more specialist and community nurse involvement, and telephone contact from general practitioners, but provision remains piecemeal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients would benefit if their families received support, and primary care may be in a good position to provide this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A proactive approach from general practitioners in the post-discharge period is valued </plain></SENT>
