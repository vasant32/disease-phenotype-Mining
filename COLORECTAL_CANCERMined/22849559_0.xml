<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study aims to evaluate peri-operative chemotherapy in patients with metastastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy by a single surgeon were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included survival, peri-operative complications, radiological and histological evidence of chemotherapy-induced lung toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2009, 51 eligible patients were identified undergoing a total of 72 pulmonary resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients received peri-operative chemotherapy, of whom 9 received an additional biological agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival rate was 72% in the whole cohort - 74% and 68% in those who received peri-operative chemotherapy (CS) and those who underwent surgery alone (S) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year relapse free survival rate was 31% in the whole cohort - 38% and â‰¤18% in CS and S groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 8% had disease progression during neoadjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical complications occurred in only 4% of patients who received pre-operative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was neither radiological nor histological evidence of lung toxicity in resected surgical specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peri-operative chemotherapy can be safely delivered to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival in this selected group of patients was favourable </plain></SENT>
