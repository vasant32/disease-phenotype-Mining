<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A cross-sectional cohort of at-risk people aged 56-88 years randomly selected from the Hunter Community Study (HCS), Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion ever reporting undertaking any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing; current screening rates for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening modality; level of screening in accordance with national screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1117 participants (70%) who returned a questionnaire, 777 were deemed asymptomatic and eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 63% of respondents had ever received any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-three per cent had ever had a faecal occult blood test (20% screened in the previous 2 years); 30% had ever had a colonoscopy (16% screened in the previous 5 years); and 7% had ever had a sigmoidoscopy (1% screened in the previous 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of adherence to screening guidelines were 21% for respondents who were @or slightly above average risk, and 45% for respondents who were @moderately increased or potentially high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening remain low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The screening rate for colonoscopy was particularly high among people who were @or slightly above average risk, despite such screening not being endorsed in the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effective strategies to improve rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and appropriate use of colonoscopy are required across the entire at-risk population </plain></SENT>
