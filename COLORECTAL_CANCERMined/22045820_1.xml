<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two multicentre randomized controlled trials (ISRCTN10351276) were performed: one randomly assigned 3196 individuals who had previously participated in colorectal screening to receive a FOBT kit at home or a standard invitation; in the second, 4219 people aged 50-69 years who did not respond to a screening invitation were either sent a FOBT or a standard recall letter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cost per returned kit was calculated in each arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participation was higher with direct FOBT mailing in both trials: relative risk 1.11 (95% CI 1.06-1.17) and 1.36 (95% CI 1.16-1.60) for previous responders and non-responders, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cost per returned kit for previous responders ranged from 4.24€ to 16.10€, and from 3.29€ to 7.36€ with FOBT mailing and standard invitation, respectively, not including staff costs; for non-responders it ranged from 17.13€ to 46.80€, and from 7.36€ to 18.30€ with FOBT mailing and standard recall, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FOBT mailing strategy modestly increased participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method can be used on a population of previous responders to reduce personnel costs and workload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When used as a reminder to non-responders, this method increases costs </plain></SENT>
