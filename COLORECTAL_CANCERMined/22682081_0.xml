<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The progression of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> is characterized by the release of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated proteases and the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific proteolytic activity in serum specimens is a promising diagnostic tool in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a mass spectrometry-based functional proteomic profiling approach that tracks the ex-vivo degradation of a synthetic endoprotease substrate in serum specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A reporter <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (RP) with the amino acid sequence WKPYDAAD was synthesized that has a known cleavage site for the cysteine-endopeptidase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> procoagulant (EC 3.4.22.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RP was added to serum specimens from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (n = 30), inflammatory controls (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30) and incubated under strictly standardized conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proteolytic fragment of the RP was quantified with liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RP-spiking showed good intra- and inter-day reproducibility with coefficients of variation (CVs) that did not exceed a value of 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The calibration curve for the anchor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was linear in the concentration range of 0.4 - 50 μmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median concentration of the RP-fragment in serum specimens from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patients (TU: 17.6 μmol/L, SD 9.0) was significantly higher when compared to non-malignant inflammatory controls (IC: 11.1 μmol/L, SD 6.1) and healthy controls (HC: 10.3 μmol/L, SD 3.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Highest area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values were seen for discrimination of TU versus HC (0.89) followed by TU versus IC (0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IC and HC could barely be separated indicated by an AUROC value of 0.57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proteolytic activity towards the RP was conserved in serum specimens that were kept at room temperature for up to 24 hours prior to the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proteolytic cleavage of reporter <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> is a surrogate marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> associated proteolytic activity in serum specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A simple, robust and highly reproducible LC/MS method has been developed that allows the quantification of proteolytic fragments in serum specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The preanalytical impact of sample handling is minimal as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated proteolytic activity towards the reporter <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is stable for at least up to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the functional protease profiling shows characteristics that are in line with routinely performed diagnostic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further work will focus on the identification of additional reporter <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> for the construction of a multiplex assay to increase diagnostic accuracy of the functional protease profiling </plain></SENT>
