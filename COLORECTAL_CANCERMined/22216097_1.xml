<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> IGF-1 is not an easily modifiable risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Combining data from the Health Professionals Follow up Study (HPFS) and the Nurses' Health Study cohort (NHS) additive and multiplicative interactions were examined between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and IGF-1, IGFBP-3 as well as C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels in 499 cases and 992 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the various analytes, being high or low was based on being either above (or equal) or below the medians, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to participants with high 25(OH)D and low IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio (reference group), participants with a high IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio were at elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> when 25(OH)D was low (odds ratio (OR): 2.05 (95% CI: 1.43 to 2.92), but not when 25(OH)D was high (OR:1.20 (95% CI: 0.84 to 1.71, p(interaction): additive =0.06, multiplicative =0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, compared to participants with high 25(OH)D and low molar IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio and low C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels (reference group), participants with a combination of either high IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio or high C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were at elevated risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> when 25(OH)D was low (OR =1.90, 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.94) but not when 25(OH)D was high (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.77, p(interaction): additive=0.004; multiplicative=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results from this study suggest that improving <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status may help lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with higher IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
