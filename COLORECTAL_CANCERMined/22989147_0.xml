<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and imaging histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who underwent PET/CT at our institution between 1 April 2007 and 31 August 2008 for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups - (A) patients evaluated for suspected local recurrence (based on conventional imaging) and (B) patients with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in excess of 5 ng/mL; in whom conventional imaging was either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative predictive value (NPV) were derived using either histopathology or follow-up imaging as the standard of reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group A (n = 44), the sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, NPV and accuracy of PET/CT were 100% (95% confidence interval (CI): 86.7-100), 84.2% (95% CI: 62.4-94.5), 89.3% (95% CI: 72.8-96.3), 100% (95% CI: 80.6-100) and 93.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group B (n = 18), the sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and NPV of PET/CT were 76.9% (95% CI: 49.7-91.8), 60.0%, (95% CI: 23.1-88.2), 83.3% (95% CI: 55.2-95.3) and 50% (95% CI: 18.8-81.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PET/CT has high accuracy in the assessment of local recurrence, particularly with regard to its NPV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PET/CT is useful for problem solving in cases of unexplained elevated CEA levels </plain></SENT>
