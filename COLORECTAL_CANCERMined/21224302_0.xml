<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 43 patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were evaluated using breath-hold DW-MRI (b-values 0, 150 and 500 s mm(-2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The b=500 s mm(-2) DW-MRI were reviewed consensually for lesion size and appearance by two readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>18/43 patients underwent surgery allowing radiological-pathological comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections were reviewed by a pathologist, who classified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> histologically as cellular, fibrotic, necrotic or mixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of DW-MRI findings and histological features were compared using the χ(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 84 metastases were found in 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On b=500 s mm(-2) DW-MRI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> showed three high signal intensity patterns: rim (55/84), uniform (23/84) and variegate (6/84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 55 metastases showing rim pattern, 54 were &gt;1 cm in diameter (p&lt;0.01, χ(2) test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>25/84 metastases were surgically resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, 11/22 metastases &gt;1 cm in diameter showed rim pattern and demonstrated central <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> at histopathology (p=0.04, χ(2) test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No definite relationship was found between uniform and variegate patterns with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rim high signal intensity was the most common appearance of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> &gt;1 cm diameter on DW-MRI at b-values of 500 s mm(-2), a finding attributable to central <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
