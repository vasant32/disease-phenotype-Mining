<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the use of image-enhanced endoscopy for visualizing laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the nongranular type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed consecutive patients with 47 non-granular-type laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that had been examined using white-light imaging, autofluorescence imaging, narrow-band imaging, and chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The quality of visualization was evaluated using a 5-point scale by less- and more-experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autofluorescence imaging provided significantly better visualization than white-light imaging for both less-experienced and experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, no significant differences were observed between the quality of visualization provided by white-light imaging and narrow-band imaging for less-experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autofluorescence imaging provides high-quality visualization of non-granular-type laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> on still images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multicenter trials should be conducted to confirm the usefulness of autofluorescence imaging in detecting laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
