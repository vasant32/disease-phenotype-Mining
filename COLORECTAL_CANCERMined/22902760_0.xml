<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the use patterns of surveillance colonoscopies among Medicare patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to identify patients who underwent curative surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from 1992 to 2005 and analyzed the timing of the first 3 colonoscopies after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early surveillance colonoscopy was defined as a colonoscopy, for no reason other than surveillance, within 3 months to 2 years after a colonoscopy examination with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 32.1% and 27.3% of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results from their first and second colonoscopies, respectively, underwent subsequent surveillance colonoscopies within 2 years (earlier than recommended) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of patients who were older than 80 years at their first colonoscopy, 23.6% underwent a repeat procedure within 2 years for no clear indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, early surveillance colonoscopy was not associated with sex, race, or patients' level of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was significant regional variation in early surveillance colonoscopies among the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant trend toward reduced occurrence of second early surveillance colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many Medicare enrollees who have undergone curative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergo surveillance colonoscopy more frequently than recommended by the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reducing overuse could free limited resources for appropriate colonoscopy examinations of inadequately screened populations </plain></SENT>
