<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of treatment, national guidelines recommend <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors have routine contact with health care providers and undergo basic ancillary testing while avoiding high-cost imaging (HCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to determine how frequently breast, prostate, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors received recommended follow-up care and HCI tests during the survivorship period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using administrative data from TRICARE beneficiaries, we identified a cohort of patients who were treated for breast, prostate, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between October 2005 and March 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were then followed through September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 3 years after initial treatment, we determined how frequently survivors received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> minimum recommended survivorship care as defined by national guidelines and underwent HCI tests and if these outcomes varied by geographic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 3148 patients underwent treatment for breast (n = 1630), prostate (n = 1173), or colorectal (n = 345) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percent received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> minimum recommended care over 3 years (breast = 74.1%, prostate = 65.3%, colorectal = 25.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 3-year period, 74.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors received a mammogram each year, whereas 69.1% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors had at least 1 colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four percent had at least 1 HCI study during the 3-year period (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography = 10.9%, computer tomography = 48.8%, magnetic resonance imaging = 36.6%) at a cost of $3.5 million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Substantial state-level variation was noted for both outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors do not receive recommended care following initial treatment while frequently undergoing HCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The existing geographic variation in quality and imaging utilization suggests that improvements to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivorship care are possible </plain></SENT>
