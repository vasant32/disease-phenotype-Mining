<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting COX may therefore have anti-carcinogenic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results from use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> inhibiting only COX have been conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been postulated that this might result from the shunting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolism to the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> cell viability is promoted by 5-LOX through several mechanisms that are similar to those of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of 5-LOX is upregulated in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the shunting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolism to the 5-LOX pathway by cyclooxygenase inhibition and to determine if this process antagonizes the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines (HCA7, HT-29 &amp; LoVo) expressing 5-LOX and different levels of COX-2 expression were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects of aspirin (a non-selective COX inhibitor) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> (COX-2 selective) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi>) secretion were quantified by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proliferation and viability were studied by quantifying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> (dsDNA) content and metabolic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined by annexin V and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> staining using confocal microscopy, and caspase-3/7 activity by fluorescent substrate assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: COX inhibitors suppressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production but enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> secretion in COX-2 expressing cell lines (Pâ€‰&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The level of COX-2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells did not significantly influence the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of COX inhibitors due to the shunting mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of shunting between COX and 5-LOX pathways in the presence of unilateral inhibition, and may explain the conflicting anti-carcinogenic effects reported with use of COX inhibitors </plain></SENT>
