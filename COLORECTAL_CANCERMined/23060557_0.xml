<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim: To evaluate the mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) I219V polymorphism in 124 unrelated South American individuals suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, based on frequency, association with pathogenic MLH1 and mutS homolog 2 (MSH2) mutation and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was obtained from peripheral blood and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed, followed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Val allelic of the I219V polymorphism was found in 51.61% (64/124) of the individuals, with an allelic frequency of 0.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MLH1 or MHS2 pathogenic mutations were found in 32.81% (21/64) and in 23.33% (14/60) of Val-carriers and non-carriers, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Val-carrying genotype was frequent in the studied population; however, it does not appear to exert any modifier effect on MLH1 or MSH2 pathogenic mutations and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
