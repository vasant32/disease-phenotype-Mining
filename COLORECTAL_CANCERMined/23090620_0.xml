<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of two tablet formulations containing 500 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (CAS number 154361-50-9) in patients with colon, colorectal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was a multicentric, open label, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose, crossover bioequivalence study in patients of either sex with colon, colorectal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients received each treatment in a crossover manner under fed conditions according to the randomization schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pre-dose blood sample was taken within 90 min prior to dosing, and serial blood sampling was done up to 10.00 h post-dose under monochromatic light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of plasma samples for concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) was carried out using a validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bioequivalence was to be concluded if the confidence intervals so constructed were within the range of 80-125 % for C(max), AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and 5'-DFCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 90 % confidence intervals for the "test/reference" mean ratios of the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic variables C(max), AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞) were clearly within the conventional bioequivalence range of 80-125 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the formulations were reasonably tolerated after a single oral dose in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> tablet formulations demonstrated equivalent rate and extent of systemic absorption, and hence were considered bioequivalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the two formulations can be considered as equivalent in terms of pharmacokinetics and safety profiles </plain></SENT>
