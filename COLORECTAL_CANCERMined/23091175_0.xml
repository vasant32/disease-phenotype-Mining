<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the long-term (10-year) survival of patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> treated with radiofrequency (RF) ablation and systemic chemotherapy with intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1997 to 2006, 99 consecutive patients with 202 small (0.8-4.0 cm; mean: 2.2 cm Â± 1.1) metachronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> underwent ultrasonography-guided percutaneous RF ablation with internally-cooled electrodes in association with systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients ineligible for surgery (n = 80) or whose lesions were potentially resectable and who refused surgery (n = 19) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up with contrast agent-enhanced computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging for a minimum of 3 years to more than 10 years after RF ablation (n = 99, 67, 49, and 25 for 3, 5, 7, and 10 or more years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall local response rates and long-term survival rates were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each of these primary endpoints, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and log-rank tests were used to assess for statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary and secondary technical success rates were 93.1% (188 of 202) and 100% (14 of 14), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> occurred in 11.9% (24 of 202) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, and 54.2% (13 of 24) of these were re-treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient survival rates increased with re-treatment versus no re-treatment (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 125 new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were found, and of these 32.8% (41 of 125) were treated with RF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rates were 98.0%, 69.3%, 47.8%, 25.0%, and 18.0% (median: 53.2 months) at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The major complication rate was 1.3% (two of 156), and there were no procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the time this article was written, 32.3% (32 of 99) of the patients were alive, and 67.7% (67 of 99) were deceased, with a median follow-up of 72 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adding RF ablation to systemic chemotherapy achieved local control in a large majority of metachronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 3- to 10-year survival rates of this relatively large series of patients were essentially equivalent to those of most surgical series reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
