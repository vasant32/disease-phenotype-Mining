<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to detect the role of GADD45B in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>); the area not studied in depth to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of GADD45B were examined by Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues (ANCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over-expression plasmids and SiRNA were used to regulate GADD45B expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines in vitro and flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to detect apoptotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of GADD45B were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues than those in ANCT (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of GADD45B was also correlated with relapse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly worse in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who showed GADD45B overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Cox multivariate analysis revealed that GADD45B overexpression and TNM stage were significant factors affecting patients' survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, GADD45B amplified from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues could induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines and may be associated with the p53-mediated apoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GADD45B, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene potentially through the p53-mediated apoptotic pathways, is paradoxically overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and as such may play an unappreciated role in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanism of GADD45B inactivation and overexpression requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GADD45B could be a potential therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment in future </plain></SENT>
