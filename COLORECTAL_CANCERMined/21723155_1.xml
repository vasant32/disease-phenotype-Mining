<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Minority groups with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have not experienced the decline in incidence and mortality that has been reported in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether differences exist in treatment and survival between white and Native American patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> because little has been written about this specific minority group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was used to compare treatment and survival in whites (colon, n = 137,949; rectum, n = 46,843) and Native Americans (colon, n = 872; rectum, n = 316) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival in Native Americans with whites, adjusted for stage, sex, age and year of diagnosis, socioeconomic status, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Native Americans presented at younger ages than whites for both colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were diagnosed at more advanced stages of disease than whites for only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were detected in the proportion of patients recommended for surgery between the two groups, for either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at any stage (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Native Americans with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> were more likely to receive radiation than whites (p &lt; 0.001), but they received less sphincter-preserving surgery (60.0% vs 65.4%; p = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Native Americans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> fared significantly worse than whites (hazard ratio = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.34), but there is no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free survival between races for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with whites, Native Americans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> have worse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival </plain></SENT>
