<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 3,377 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> from three university hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (OS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (CSS) rates were compared between patients whose stages according to the seventh-staging system remained the same and patients whose stages migrated, and between subgroups within each new stage (homogeneity analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In seventh edition, the 5-year OS and CSS rates of patients with T3n2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were significantly greater in the downstaged patients (T3N2a) than in other patients (T3N2b) (OS, P = 0.010; CSS, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rates for patients with T4a and T4b sub-classifications according to the seventh edition did not differ from those in patients with T4N0-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homogeneity analysis of subgroups classified using the new system showed that some subgroups of stage IIIB (T3N2a/T4aN1) had poorer survival rates compared with patients in other sub-categories in the same stage IIIB (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, the seventh edition provides a more detailed classification of the prognosis than the old system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, further study would be warranted to evaluate the validity of sub-classification in seventh TNM-staging system, especially for T4a-b and T3N2a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
