<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate if high-definition (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) colonoscope with i-Scan gave a higher detection rate of mucosal lesions vs standard white-light instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected from the computerized database of the endoscopy unit of our tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 1101 consecutive colonoscopies that were performed over 1 year with standard white-light (n = 849) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>+ with i-Scan (n = 252) instruments by four endoscopists, in an outpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy records included patients' main details and family history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, indication for colonoscopy (screening, diagnostic or surveillance), type of instrument used (standard white-light or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>+ plus i-Scan), name of endoscopist and bowel preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Records for each procedure included whether the cecum was reached or not and the reason for failure, complications during or immediately after the procedure, and number, size, location and characteristics of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> or protruding lesions were defined as sessile or pedunculated, and nonprotruding lesions were defined according to Paris classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each lesion, histological diagnosis was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight hundred and forty-nine colonoscopies were carried with the standard white-light video colonoscope and 252 with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>+ plus i-Scan video colonoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The four endoscopists did 264, 300, 276 and 261 procedures, respectively; 21.6%, 24.0%, 21.7% and 24.1% of them with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>+ plus i-Scan technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the four endoscopists in either the number of procedures done or the proportions of each imaging technique used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both techniques detected one or more mucosal lesions in 522/1101 procedures (47.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall number of lesions recognized was 1266; 645 in the right colon and 621 in the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher number of colonoscopies recognized lesions in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>+ plus i-Scan mode (171/252 = 67.9%) than with the standard white-light technique (408/849 = 48.1%) (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>+ with i-Scan colonoscopies identified more lesions than standard white-light imaging (459/252 and 807/849, P &lt; 0.0001), in the right or left colon (mean ± SD, 1.62 ± 1.36 vs. 1.33 ± 0.73, P &lt; 0.003 and 1.55 ± 0.98 vs. 1.17 ± 0.93, P = 0.033), more lesions &lt; 10 mm (P &lt; 0.0001) or nonprotruding (P &lt; 0.022), and flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cumulative mean number of lesions per procedure detected by the four endoscopists was significantly higher with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>+ with i-Scan than with standard white-light imaging (1.82 ± 2.89 vs. 0.95 ± 1.35, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> imaging with i-Scan during the withdrawal phase of colonoscopy significantly increased the detection of colonic mucosal lesions, particularly small and nonprotruding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
