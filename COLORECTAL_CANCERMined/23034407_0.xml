<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25357">mitomycin</z:chebi>- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy combination in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">nonsmall cell lung cancer</z:e> progressing after previous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: /st&gt;Thirty-one consecutive patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">nonsmall cell lung cancer</z:e>, who underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25357">mitomycin</z:chebi>- plus irinotecan-based chemotherapy as salvage treatment after failure of at least two previous systemic treatments, were retrospectively identified in our database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between September 2003 and March 2011, 31 patients with histologically proven stage IIIB or IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">nonsmall cell lung cancer</z:e>, received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25357">mitomycin</z:chebi> 5 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by irinotecan 150 mg/m(2) on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cycles were repeated at 2-week interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: /st&gt;A total of 164 cycles of treatment were given with a median of five per patient (range 1-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The objective responses included partial response in 6 patients (19.3%), stable disease in 4 (13%), and progressive disease in 21 (67.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time to disease progression was 4 months, and median survival was 9+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (38%) reached 1-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 toxicities occurred in seven patients (22.5%), mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>), mucositis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: /st&gt;The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25357">mitomycin</z:chebi>- and irinotecan-based combination chemotherapy seems to be tolerated and active in this subset of heavily pretreated patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">nonsmall cell lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, evaluation or recruitment of a larger number of patients would be needed to provide more adequate data on safety and activity of the described combination </plain></SENT>
