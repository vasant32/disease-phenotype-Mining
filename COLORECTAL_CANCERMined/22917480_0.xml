<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological staging is efficient, but combination with molecular markers may improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiles have been defined as prognosis predictors among stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but their implementation in medical practice remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have been recognized as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group, and high-risk morphologic features have been used to justify adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose here the investigation of clinical features and expression profiles from stage II and stage III colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> without DNA mismatch repair defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two series of 130 and 66 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> samples were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression profiles were established on oligonucleotide microarrays and processed in the R/Bioconductor environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical, then supervised, analyses were successively performed by applying a data-sampling approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A molecular signature of seven genes was found to cluster stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with adjusted p values lower than 10(-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> aggregated this cluster in both series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found with disease severity, but the function of the discriminating genes suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have been classified according to their putative response to adjuvant targeted or classic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further pharmacogenetic studies might verify this observation </plain></SENT>
