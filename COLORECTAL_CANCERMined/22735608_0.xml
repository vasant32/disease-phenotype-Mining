<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Colonoscopy workload for endoscopy services in Western countries is increasing markedly because of the implementation of faecal occult blood-based mass screening programmes against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore explored the possibility of using a combination of faecal tests to prioritize the access to colonoscopy with criteria other than symptoms and/or time of referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND METHODS: We tested a combination of faecal tests [immunochemical faecal occult blood test (i-FOBT), M2-PK, calprotectin] as markers for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in a selected series of patients requiring colonoscopy for the suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the tests were performed in a 1-day stool sample of patients aged 50-80 years, without any dietary restriction, before colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 280 patients' stool single samples were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 85 patients had one or more advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>(s) at colonoscopy/histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were associated with a highly significant increase (P&lt;0.001) in faecal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> M2-PK (mean 24.2 kU/l), which correlated with Dukes' staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection, i-FOBT was the test with the highest specificity and positive predictive value (0.89 and 0.53), whereas M2-PK had the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value (0.87 and 0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calprotectin showed performance similar to M2-PK in terms of sensitivity and negative predictive value (0.93), but had lower specificity (0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best combination of tests to predict the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in this series was i-FOBT+M2-PK, as in patients showing positivity to both markers, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was as high as 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of i-FOBT and M2-PK is a sensitive tool in clinical practice for the appropriate management of waiting lists for colonoscopy, as it allows the classification of patients into different degrees of priority for investigation, according to their foreseeable risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
