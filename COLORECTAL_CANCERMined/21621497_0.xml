<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed to analyze TFPI2 gene promoter methylation status in a blinded fashion in stool samples taken from 30 endoscopically diagnosed healthy controls, 20 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and 60 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time Alu PCR was used to quantify human long DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The specificity of fecal TFPI2 MSP assay and long DNA assay was 100% and 83.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of fecal TFPI2 MSP assay and long DNA assay was 68.3% and 53.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of fecal DNA assay (either marker being positive) was 86.7%, which was high for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results have demonstrated the feasibility of using TFPI2 methylation and quantify human long DNA with fluorescent quantitative Alu PCR in fecal samples as a new noninvasive test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
