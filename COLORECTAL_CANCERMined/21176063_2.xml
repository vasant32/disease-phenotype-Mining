<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Computer records for patients diagnosed with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2007 were retrieved from the Rotterdam <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e>, chemotherapy use, hepatic surgery and survival were evaluated according to year of diagnosis, age, gender and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the southwestern part of the Netherlands, 19 014 new patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were diagnosed and synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> was found in 3482 (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This proportion increased during the study period, from 16% to 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> was performed in approximately 50% of the patients and did not change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative 30-day mortality was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy use increased from 18% in the first period to 56% in the latest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liver surgery increased from 4% in the first period to 10% in the latest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival increased from 7 months to 12 months and 2-year survival increased from 14% to 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two-year survival declined with increasing age and was significantly worse for right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survival of patients with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has improved over time and this is probably a result of the increased use of chemotherapy and the increased numbers of patients who underwent hepatic surgery </plain></SENT>
