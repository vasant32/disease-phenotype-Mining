<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), it is believed that TP53 mutations play a role in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> transition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to analyze TP53 expressed alleles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we examined TP53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from 101 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were divided in two groups defined according to whether they exhibit positive or negative P53 protein expression as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of TP53 mutation was a common event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with an overall frequency of 54.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By direct sequencing, we report 42 different TP53 sequence changes in 55 CRC patients, being two of them validated polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutations were more frequent in positive than in negative P53 detection group (p&lt;0.0001), being the precise figures 79.6% and 30.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mutation profiles were also different between the two groups of samples; while most of the mutations detected in P53 positive group were missense (38 out of 39), changes in P53 negative detection group include 7 insertions/deletions, 6 missense, 2 nonsense and 1 silent mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As previously observed, most mutations were concentrated in regions encoding P53 DNA binding domain (DBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Codons 175, 248 and 273 together account for 36.7% of point mutations, in agreement with previous observations provided that these codons are considered mutation hotspots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we detected two new deletions and two new insertions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, in three samples we detected two deletions and one insertion that could be explained as putative splicing variants or splicing errors </plain></SENT>
