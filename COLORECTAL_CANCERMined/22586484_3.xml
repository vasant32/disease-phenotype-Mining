<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate the frequency and relationship of the KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations and the loss of PTEN expression in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genomic DNA was extracted from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of 69 patients with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Automated sequencing analysis was conducted to detect mutations in the KRAS (codons 12, 13, and 14), BRAF (codon 600) and PIK3CA (codons 542, 545 and 1047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTEN protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on 3 mm FFPE tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 16.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations and loss of PTEN expression was 43.9% (25/57), 25.4% (15/59), 8.2% (5/61) and 47.8% (33/69), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent mutation in KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA was V14G (26.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations), V600E (40.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations) and V600L (40.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations), and H1047L (80.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six KRAS mutant patients (24.0%) harbored BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were mutually exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was observed between the four biomarkers and patients' characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: BRAF mutation rate is much higher in this study than in other studies, and overlap a lot with KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Besides, the specific types of KRAS and PIK3CA mutations in Chinese patients could be quite different from that of patients in other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to examine their impact on prognosis and response to targeted treatment </plain></SENT>
