<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have concentrated on characterizing T cell populations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> where T cells with regulatory effect (Foxp3+ Tregs) have been identified as both enhancing and diminishing anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No previous studies have characterized the T cell response in the regional lymph nodes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to analyse CD4, CD8 or Foxp3+ T cell populations in the regional lymph nodes of patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n = 31), with (n = 13) or without (n = 18) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> after 5 years of follow up, to determine if the priming environment for anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumour immunity</z:e> was associated with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportions of CD4, CD8 or Foxp3+ cells in the lymph nodes varied widely between and within patients, and there was no association between T cell populations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> or other clinicopathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that frequency of these T cell subsets in lymph nodes may not be a useful tool for predicting patient outcome </plain></SENT>
