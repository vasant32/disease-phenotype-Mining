<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a method that enriches for methylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> by capturing the fraction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-treated DNA with unconverted <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method, called streptavidin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> ligand methylation enrichment (SuBLiME), involves the specific labeling (using a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-labeled nucleotide ligand) of methylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-converted DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This step is then followed by affinity capture, using streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SuBLiME is highly adaptable and can be combined with deep sequencing library generation and/or genomic complexity-reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study, we enriched methylated DNA from Csp6I-cut complexity-reduced genomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines (HCT-116, HT-29 and SW-480) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood leukocytes with the aim of discovering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enriched libraries were sequenced with SOLiD-3 technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In pairwise comparisons, we scored a total of 1,769 gene loci and 33 miRNA loci as differentially methylated between the cell lines and leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 516 loci were differently methylated in at least two promoter-proximal CpG sites over two discrete Csp6I fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identified methylated gene loci were associated with anatomical development, differentiation and cell signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data correlated with good agreement to a number of published <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> DNA methylation biomarkers and genomic data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SuBLiME is effective in the enrichment of methylated nucleic acid and in the detection of known and novel biomarkers </plain></SENT>
