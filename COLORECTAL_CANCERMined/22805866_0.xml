<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Infective complications particularly in the form of surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> including anastomotic leak represent a serious morbidity after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and white cell count, have been reported to provide early detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their relative predictive value is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the diagnostic accuracy of serial postoperative WCC, albumin and CRP in detecting infective complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: White cell count, albumin and CRP were measured postoperatively for 7 days in 454 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> postoperative complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy of the white cell count, albumin and CRP values were analyzed by receiver operating characteristics curve analysis with surgical site infective complications as outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred four patients (23 %) developed infective complications, and 26 of them developed an anastomotic leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CRP was most sensitive to the development of an infective complication, surgical site or at a remote site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day 3 CRP the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.80 (p &lt; 0.001) and the optimal cutoff value was 170 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This threshold was also associated with an increase in the length of hospital stay (p &lt; 0.001), 30 day mortality (p &lt; 0.05) and 12 month mortality (p &lt; 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative CRP measurement on day 3 postoperatively is clinically useful in predicting surgical site infective complications, including an anastomotic leak, in patients undergoing surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
