<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> is a relatively well-studied technology with established guidelines regarding patient selection, although its implementation is technically complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the extent to which local availability of SRS affected the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 3030 patients who received whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> in 1 of 7 cancer centers in Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were abstracted for a random sample of 973 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the use of SRS as a boost within 4 months following WBRT or at any time following WBRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 898 patients eligible for analysis, SRS was provided to 70 (7.8%) patients at some time during the course of their disease and to 34 (3.8%) patients as a boost following WBRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses, factors significantly associated with the use of SRS boost following WBRT were fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> (odds ratio [OR] = 6.50), controlled extracranial disease (OR = 3.49), age (OR = 0.97 per year of advancing age), and the presence of an on-site SRS program at the hospital where WBRT was given (OR = 12.34; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values were &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, availability of on-site SRS was the factor most predictive of the use of SRS at any time following WBRT (OR = 5.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with 1-3 brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, good/fair performance status, and no evidence of active extracranial disease, SRS was provided to 40.3% of patients who received WBRT in a hospital that had an on-site SRS program vs 3.0% of patients who received WBRT at a hospital without SRS (P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The availability of on-site SRS is the factor most strongly associated with the provision of this treatment to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> and appears to be more influential than accepted clinical eligibility factors </plain></SENT>
