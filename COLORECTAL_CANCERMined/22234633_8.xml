<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this phase III trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab alone with those of bevacizumab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX) as maintenance treatment following induction chemotherapy with XELOX plus bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of bevacizumab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> every 3 weeks followed by XELOX plus bevacizumab or bevacizumab alone until progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival (PFS) interval; secondary endpoints were the overall survival (OS) time, objective response rate (RR), time to response, duration of response, and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population comprised 480 patients (XELOX plus bevacizumab, n = 239; bevacizumab, n = 241); there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 29.0 months (range, 0-53.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in the median PFS or OS times or in the RR between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the XELOX plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab arms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the noninferiority of bevacizumab versus XELOX plus bevacizumab cannot be confirmed, we can reliably exclude a median PFS detriment &gt;3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that maintenance therapy with single-agent bevacizumab may be an appropriate option following induction XELOX plus bevacizumab in mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
