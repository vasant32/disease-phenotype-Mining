<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Inconsistency of reported associations between the C1420T polymorphism in the cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1) gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) prompted us to undertake a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted searches of published literature in MEDLINE through PubMed up to April 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual data on 5,043 cases and 6,311 controls from 15 published case-control studies were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses were performed on the compiled dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the overall analysis, association was lacking between the C1420T polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (odds ratio [OR] 0.96-1.04, p = 0.47-0.77), materially unchanged when reanalyzed without the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium-deviating studies (OR 1.03-1.09, p = 0.22-0.55) or subjected to outlier treatment (OR 0.89-0.99, p = 0.10-0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ethnic subgroups, Europeans were susceptible (OR 1.11-1.17, p = 0.13-0.48) and Americans, slightly protected (OR 0.86-0.87, p = 0.49-0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased risk effects, however, became null following outlier treatment (OR 0.95-1.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Test for interaction between decreased risk associations in the low-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> subgroup (OR 0.60-0.85, p = 0.009-0.03) with the susceptible effects in the high-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> category (OR 1.14-1.22, p = 0.19-0.32) was significant (p (interaction) = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall summary estimates imply no associations but suggest geography-specific effects of the SHMT1 polymorphism that render Europeans susceptible, but not Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> status appears to show an inverse association of this polymorphism with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
