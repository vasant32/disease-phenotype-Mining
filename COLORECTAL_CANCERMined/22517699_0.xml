<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue specimens from 75 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases (Dukes stage C and D) were tested for Smad4, E-cadherin and beta-catenin by the Avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi> immunoperoxidase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with patients' clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Smad4 expression was lost or reduced in roughly 1 out of every 3 Dukes C and D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association of Smad4 expression with other clinicopathological parameters was not noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association of expression of E-cadherin with other clinicopathological parameters was not noted, apart from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of beta-catenin was not associated with clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lack of expression of Smad4 was associated with lack of expression of both E-cadherin (&lt;0.000) and beta-catenin (p&lt;0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As regards the relation between E-cadherin and beta-catenin, the expression of each seemed to parallel the expression of the other (p&lt;0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Beta-catenin was overexpressed in 68.5% of the specimens studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinically advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is associated with a reduced or complete lack of expression of Smad4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ecadherin and beta-catenin are expressed in parallel with each other and also with Smad4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor role of Smad4 by affecting both E-cadherin and beta-catenin may indicate a novel pathway for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e> via cellular reshaping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The precise underlined mechanism(s) and the clinical significance of these findings remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
