<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Existing studies that examine the effect of neoadjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> (CRT) for locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> on patient quality of life (QOL) are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goals were to prospectively explore <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes in patient-reported QOL endpoints during and after treatment and to establish a distribution of scores that could be used for comparison as new treatment modalities emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty patients with locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> were prospectively enrolled at 2 institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EORTC QLQ-CR30) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific (EORTC QLQ-CR38 and EORTC QLQ-CR 29) QOL questionnaires were administered to patients 1 month before they began CRT, at week 4 of CRT, and 1 month after they had finished CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The questionnaires included multiple symptom scales, functional domains, and a composite global QOL score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a toxicity scale was completed by providers 1 month before the beginning of CRT, weekly during treatment, and 1 month after the end of CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Global QOL showed a statistically significant and borderline clinically significant decrease during CRT (-9.50, P=.0024) but returned to baseline 1 month after the end of treatment (-0.33, P=.9205) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptoms during treatment were mostly gastrointestinal (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> +9.94, P&lt;.0001; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> +16.67, P=.0022), urinary (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100518'>dysuria</z:hpo> +13.33, P&lt;.0001; and frequency +11.82, P=.0006) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (+16.22, P&lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These symptoms returned to baseline after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, sexual enjoyment (P=.0236) and sexual function (P=.0047) remained persistently diminished after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal cancer</z:e> patients undergoing neoadjuvant CRT may experience a reduction in global QOL along with significant gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, provider-rated toxicity scales may not fully capture this decrease in patient-reported QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although most symptoms are transient, impairment in sexual function may persist after the completion of therapy and merits further investigation </plain></SENT>
