<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate an influence of H&amp;E staining on DNA testing, we isolated DNA from 10 unstained, 10 hematoxylin-stained, 10 eosin-stained, and 10 H&amp;E-stained tissue sections (ie, 4 groups), from each of 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 4 groups, we did not observe any significant or appreciable difference in DNA fragmentation by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, in DNA amplification by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in microsatellite PCR fragment analyses, or in a PCR-pyrosequencing assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a proof-of-principle study, we successfully performed microsatellite instability analysis and sequencing of KRAS and BRAF on more than 1,300 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> using DNA extracted from H&amp;E-stained tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data provide no evidence for an interfering effect of H&amp;E staining on DNA testing, suggesting that DNA from H&amp;E-stained sections can be effectively used for routine DNA testing </plain></SENT>
