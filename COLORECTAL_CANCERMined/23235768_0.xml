<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our patient was treated after surgery with a conventional chemotherapy regimen including bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody, which was demonstrated to improve the clinical results in the treatment of colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> compared with chemotherapy alone, and is today approved both for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides the unconventional association of the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types in our patient and the unsatisfactory clinical benefit obtained with the medical treatment administered, we report on the significance of AFP serum levels as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker in this peculiar situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our patient these levels, monitored from the first clinical symptoms through the last chemotherapy course, did not show any correlation with the response to treatment or with the patient's overall outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, the serum marker remained essentially unchanged after the surgical removal of the lung mass and the subsequent chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
