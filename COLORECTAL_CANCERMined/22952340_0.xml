<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study consisted of a phantom study and a retrospective analysis of 39 consecutive patients who underwent clinical (18)F-FDG PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The body phantom of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association and International Electrotechnical Commission with a 10-mm-diameter sphere was filled with an (18)F-FDG solution with a 4:1 radioactivity ratio compared with the background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PET data were reconstructed with the baseline ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm, with the OSEM+PSF model, with the OSEM+TOF model, and with the OSEM+PSF+TOF model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated image quality by visual assessment, the signal-to-noise ratio of the 10-mm sphere (SNR(10 mm)), the contrast of the 10-mm sphere, and the coefficient of variance in the phantom study and then determined the optimal reconstruction parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effects of PSF and TOF on the quality of clinical images using the signal-to-noise ratio in the liver (SNR(liver)) in relation to the NEC in the liver (NEC(liver)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the phantom study, the SNR(10 mm) was the highest for the OSEM+PSF+TOF model, and the highest value was obtained at iteration 2 for algorithms with the TOF and at iteration 3 for those without the TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In terms of a postsmoothing filter full width at half maximum (FWHM), the high SNR(10 mm) was obtained with no filtering or was smaller than 2 mm for algorithms with PSF and was 4-6 mm for those without PSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The balance between the contrast recovery and noise is different for algorithms with either PSF or TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A combination of PSF and TOF improved SNR(10 mm), contrast, and coefficient of variance, especially with a small-FWHM gaussian filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the clinical study, the SNR(liver) of the low-NEC(liver) group in the OSEM+PSF+TOF model was compared with that of the high-NEC(liver) group in conventional OSEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The PSF+TOF improved the SNR(liver) by about 24.9% Â± 9.81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A combination of PSF and TOF clearly improves image quality, whereas optimization of the reconstruction parameters is necessary to obtain the best performance for PSF or TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this combination has the potential to provide good image quality with either lower activity or shorter acquisition time, thus improving patient comfort and reducing the radiation burden </plain></SENT>
