<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to retrospectively determine the histological features of <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> resected by endoscopic procedures or surgery using an updated database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the clinicopathological features of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, less than 20 mm in size, which were removed by endoscopy from January 2009 to November 2011 at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Hospital (NCCH), Tokyo, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Less than 1% diminutive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (≤5 mm) were classified as mucosal high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (Category 4), and no submucosal invasion by <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (Category 5) lesions were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 3% of small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (6-9 mm) were classified as Category 5; of these, 6% were submucosal deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, depressed components were observed more frequently in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in both small and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (10-20 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In light of the 'predict, resect, and discard' strategies for small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, we should pay attention to the possible clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of small and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
