<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line (HCT-R) that, unlike its parental cell line, HCT-116, does not respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> exposure with hyperactivation of Wnt signaling and suppressed clonal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCR array analyses revealed Wnt pathway-related genes, the expression of which differs between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-sensitive HCT-116 CRC cells and their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-resistant HCT-R cell counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified overexpression of Tcf3 as being partially responsible for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-resistant phenotype, as this DNA-binding protein suppresses the hyperinduction of Wnt activity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, Tcf3 knockdown in HCT-R cells restores their sensitivity to the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> on Wnt activity and clonal cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the effects of overexpressed Tcf3 differ between HCT-116 and HCT-R cells; thus, in HCT-116 cells Tcf3 suppresses proliferation without rendering the cells resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In HCT-R cells, however, the overexpression of Tcf3 inhibits Wnt activity, and the cells are still able to proliferate due to the higher expression levels of cell cycle factors, particularly those driving the G(1) to S transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms determining the variable sensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> may assist in developing approaches that prevent or reverse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
