<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the detection rates and characteristics of large or proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in Chinese patients undergoing screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive screening colonoscopies performed between 2008 and 2011 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath>, sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and traditional serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were defined as serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> with a diameter ≥ 10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions proximal to the descending colon were considered as proximal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> included invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with any villous histology and tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> ≥ 10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1282 colonoscopies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection rates for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and large serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were 26.1%, 10.5%, 7.2% and 2.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between synchronous advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and large serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (P = 0.002) or proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age ≥ 55 years (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.8) and the presence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.1) were significantly associated with the presence of large or proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Males had more advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.9), but not more large or proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Large and proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were detected in 2.3% and 7.2% of Chinese patients undergoing screening colonoscopies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Individuals with large or proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> have a higher risk of synchronous advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
