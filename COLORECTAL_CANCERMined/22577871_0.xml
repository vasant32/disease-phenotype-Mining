<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several studies have implicated primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) as an additional risk factor for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some reports have indicated that the risk is even higher in PSC-IBD patients after liver transplantation (Ltx), but this issue is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in PSC-IBD patients before and after Ltx and to identify risk factors for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a multicenter study within the Nordic Liver Transplant Group, we assessed the risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> by using the competing risk regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 439 PSC patients included, 353 (80%) had IBD at the time of Ltx and 15 (3%) patients developed de novo IBD post-Ltx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of IBD was 15 (0-50) years at the time of Ltx and follow-up after Ltx was 5 (0-20) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one (25%) PSC-IBD patients developed colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was higher after than before Ltx (HR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.9, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis demonstrated aminosalicylates and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> as significantly associated with an increased risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> post-Ltx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Duration and activity of IBD did not significantly affect the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The even higher risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in PSC-IBD patients after when compared with that of before Ltx underscores the importance of regular surveillance colonoscopies post-Ltx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association of aminosalicylates and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> to the development of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> after Ltx should be further investigated </plain></SENT>
