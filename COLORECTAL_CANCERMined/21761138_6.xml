<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified novel susceptibility loci for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To follow up on these findings, and try to identify novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> susceptibility loci, we present results for GWAS of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (2,906 cases, 3,416 controls) that have not previously published main associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using log-additive models for each study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to improve our power to detect novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis combining the results across studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We selected the most statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for replication using ten independent studies (8,161 cases and 9,101 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We again used a meta-analysis to summarize results for the replication studies alone, and for a combined analysis of GWAS and replication studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We measured ten SNPs previously identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> susceptibility loci and found eight to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (p value range 0.02 to 1.8 × 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When we excluded studies that have previously published on these SNPs, five SNPs remained significant at p &lt; 0.05 in the combined analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No novel susceptibility loci were significant in the replication study after adjustment for multiple testing, and none reached genome-wide significance from a combined analysis of GWAS and replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed marginally significant evidence for a second independent SNP in the BMP2 region at chromosomal location 20p12 (rs4813802; replication p value 0.03; combined p value 7.3 × 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a region on 5p33.15, which includes the coding regions of the TERT-CLPTM1L genes and has been identified in GWAS to be associated with susceptibility to at least seven other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, we observed a marginally significant association with rs2853668 (replication p value 0.03; combined p value 1.9 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests a complex nature of the contribution of common genetic variants to risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
