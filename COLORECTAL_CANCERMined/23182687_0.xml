<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prescribed aspirin had improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: An observational population cohort study was undertaken using data linkage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry, dispensed prescriptions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate records in Tayside, Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> community prescribed aspirin pre- and post-diagnosis was extracted and periods of aspirin use post-diagnosis for each individual were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and colorectal mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two thousand nine hundred ninety patients were identified with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1st January 1997 and 30th December 2006 and followed up until 28th February 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 73 (interquartile range [IQR] 65-80) with 52% male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One thousand nine hundred ninety-eight (67%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were recorded with 1021 (34%) attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One thousand three hundred forty (45%) patients used aspirin at some stage of the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aspirin use post-diagnosis was associated with lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.57-0.79, p&lt;0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specific mortality after allowing for age, Dukes' stage, gender, socio-economic status and aspirin use pre-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing age and stage at diagnosis were associated with increased risk, with more affluent patients at reduced risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that aspirin use post-diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may reduce both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However further work is required to ensure this is a causal relationship and to identify whether it is best used in specific groups of patients </plain></SENT>
