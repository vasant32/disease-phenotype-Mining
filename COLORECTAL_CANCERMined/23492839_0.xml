<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: P53 is an important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor, which is mutated in later stages of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and leads to resistance to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to reveal mutations of TP53 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Kerman province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of Forty-three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> specimens as paraffin block or fresh tissues, which passed stage IIIA, were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three exons 5, 7 and 8 of P53 were amplified by PCR technique and sequenced directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed two deletions at codon 140 and 142 in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GAT→AAT mutation at codon 184, and CGG→TGG mutation at codon 248 were seen in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some mutations were also observed in middle of intron 7 in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Some of those patients with mutation in P53 gene had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, genetic test before chemotherapy is helpful for successful treatment </plain></SENT>
