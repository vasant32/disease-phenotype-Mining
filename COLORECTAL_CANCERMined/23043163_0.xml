<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Preclinical data suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the association between the use of synthetic PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, represented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs), and the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, case-control study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case subjects were defined as patients who were diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at least 365 days prior to a new diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 2000 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We randomly selected diabetic control subjects for each case subject, which were matched by sex, age, and the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 24,496 eligible case subjects and control subjects, we used conditional logistic regression to assess the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in association with the use of TZDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional analysis was conducted to assess the effects of concomitant use of TZDs and low-dose aspirin or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was observed in patients who had used TZDs compared with those who had never used TZDs (adjusted odds ratio 0.86 [95% CI 0.79-0.94]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the benefit of a decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk was also found with concomitant use of TZDs and low-dose aspirin or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of TZDs may be associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings </plain></SENT>
