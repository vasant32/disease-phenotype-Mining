<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increasing use of gastrointestinal endoscopy, particularly for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, and increasing emphasis on health care quality, highlight the need for clearly defined, evidence-based processes to support quality improvement in endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify processes and indicators of quality and safety relevant to high-quality endoscopy service delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of 35 voting participants developed recommendation statements and performance indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systematic literature searches generated 50 initial statements that were revised iteratively following a modified Delphi approach using a web-based evaluation and voting tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statement development and evidence evaluation followed the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines, REsearch and Evaluation) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the consensus conference, participants voted anonymously on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> statements using a 6-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent web-based voting evaluated recommendations for specific, individual quality indicators, safety indicators and mandatory endoscopy reporting fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consensus was defined a priori as agreement by 80% of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 23 recommendation statements addressing the following: ethics (statement 1: agreement 100%), facility standards and policies (statements 2 to 9: 90% to 100%), quality assurance (statements 10 to 13: 94% to 100%), training, education, competency and privileges (statements 14 to 19: 97% to 100%), endoscopy reporting standards (statements 20 and 21: 97% to 100%) and patient perceptions (statements 22 and 23: 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 18 quality indicators (agreement 83% to 100%), 20 safety indicators (agreement 77% to 100%) and 23 recommended endoscopy-reporting elements (agreement 91% to 100%) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The consensus process identified a clear need for high-quality clinical and outcomes research to support quality improvement in the delivery of endoscopy services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The guidelines support quality improvement in endoscopy by providing explicit recommendations on systematic monitoring, assessment and modification of endoscopy service delivery to yield benefits for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients affected by the practice of gastrointestinal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
