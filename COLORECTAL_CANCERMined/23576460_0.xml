<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: An audit of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> diagnosed over a 4-year period: 2009 to 2012 was undertaken to ascertain the reporting trends of sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (SSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> right sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> (HP) proximal to the splenic flexure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> designated SSP were retrieved from the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three pathologists blinded to the original diagnosis re-examined the slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent American College of Gastroenterology guidelines for the diagnosis of SSP was utilised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No cases of SSP were diagnosed in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2010, 32 right-sided cases were encountered, 83 confirmed in 2011 and 134 confirmed in 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of these were right-sided.With regards to right-sided HP that were re-classified as SSP the data is as follows: 20 of 66 in 2009 (30%); 58 of 91 in 2010 (64%); 42 of 106 (40%) in 2011 and 69 of 206 in 2012 (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated an almost exponential increase in the diagnosis of SSP over a 4-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 30 to 64% of right-sided HP were re-classified as SSP over the 4-year period suggesting that greater awareness of the diagnostic criteria for SSP is required.SSP is an important precursor lesion in the serrated pathway of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its recognition is important for surveillance and therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
