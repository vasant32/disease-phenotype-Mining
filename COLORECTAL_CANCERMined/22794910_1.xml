<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated in different age groups the outcome in terms of median overall and progression-free survival, response rate, disease control rate, relative dose intensity (RDI), tolerability, and global quality of life (QoL) of first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> monotherapy (CAP) versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> + irinotecan (CAPIRI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> + bevacizumab (CAPOX + BEV) in the CAIRO and CAIRO2 study, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized into three age groups: age &gt; 75, 70-75 and &lt; 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical outcomes were not significantly different among age groups, with the exception of a higher response rate from CAP treatment in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients treated with CAPOX + BEV showed a trend towards a worse median overall survival compared to younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only treatment with CAP resulted in a higher incidence of grade 3-4 toxicity and a lower RDI in elderly versus younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CAP and CAPOX + BEV in elderly patients was significantly more often discontinued due to toxicity instead of progression to disease compared to younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in global QoL was comparable for the three age groups for each treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We did not observe significant differences in survival outcomes between elderly and younger metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with three different first-line systemic treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that initial dose reduction of CAP monotherapy may be indicated in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
