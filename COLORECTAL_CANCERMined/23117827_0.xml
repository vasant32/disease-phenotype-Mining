<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, to assess the relationship between chemically induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric tumor</z:e> and canonical Wnt signaling pathway in genetically intact mice, histopathological and quantitative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> analyses were performed in C57BL/6J mice given drinking water containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50102">N-methyl- N-nitrosurea</z:chebi> (MNU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>60.5% of gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 27.9% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were observed 48 weeks after first administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, in immunohistochemical analysis, aberrant expressions of phospho-GSK-3β, β-catenin, cyclin D1, c-Myc, osteopontin and COX-2 were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In double immunofluorescent-antibody stains, β-catenin accumulation was colocalized with other proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of cyclin D1, c-myc and COX-2 were relatively higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, canonical Wnt pathway was highly involved in MNU induced gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of C57BL/6J mice, and it could be a considerably suitable system for the study to examine the linkage between gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and the canonical Wnt pathway </plain></SENT>
