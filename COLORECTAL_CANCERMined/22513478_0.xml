<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Caspase-8 (CASP8) is encoded by the CASP8 gene and is centrally involved in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between a six-nucleotide deletion polymorphism (-652 6N del) of the CASP8 gene and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is widely reported; however, study results have been inconsistent and contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the association between the CASP8 -652 6N del polymorphism and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and to overcome the limitations of any individual study, a meta-analysis based on a total of 23 700 cases and 26 412 controls from 30 case-control studies was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the overall analysis suggested that the CASP8 -652 6N del polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> for the allele contrast [del versus ins: odd ratio (OR) = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.80-0.92], the additive genetic model (del/del versus ins/ins: OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.69-0.88), the dominant genetic model (del/del+del/ins versus ins/ins: OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.78-0.89) and the recessive genetic model (del/del versus ins/ins+del/ins: OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, after stratification for ethnicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type, significantly reduced risk was found for Asians and Caucasians as well as for individuals in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> group and the 'other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>' group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, there is an association between the CASP8 -652 6N del polymorphism and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, especially among Asians, Caucasians and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, further research, such as studies focusing on additional ethnic groups and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types, is needed to provide a more exact and comprehensive synthesis conclusion </plain></SENT>
