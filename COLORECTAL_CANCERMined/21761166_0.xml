<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A variety of approaches are available for division of major vascular structures during laparoscopic colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonic coagulating shears (UCS), vascular staplers, plastic or <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> clips and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing (EBVS) are currently available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with an EBVS device, LigaSure™ (Covidien AG), used in division of the ileocolic, middle colic and inferior mesenteric arteries during laparoscopic colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the immediate outcome of 802 consecutive unselected patients who underwent elective laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection performed with use of the LigaSure™ (5 and 10 mm) at our institution over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operative procedures included right hemicolectomy (n = 180), left hemicolectomy (n = 96), sigmoid colectomy (n = 347) and anterior resection (n = 179) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from a prospectively maintained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> database and operative records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedures were performed primarily by three consultant surgeons with an interest in laparoscopic colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 802 cases in which the LigaSure™ device was employed to divide major vascular structures, immediate effective vessel sealing was achieved in 99.8% (n = 800) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced related adverse events both following division of the inferior mesenteric artery with a 5 mm LigaSure™ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both patients had immediate uncontrolled haemorrhage that required laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of the LigaSure™ device to seal and divide the major mesenteric vessels during laparoscopic colorectal resection is very effective, with a high success rate of 99.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Caution should be exercised in elderly atherosclerotic patients, particularly when using the 5-mm LigaSure™ device </plain></SENT>
