<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled a total of 39 patients with stage III or IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> OIPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> by increasing the dose from 30 mg/day to 60 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' pain intensity was rated at baseline and 12 weeks after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of neuropathic pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) score and the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients (23.1%) discontinued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> before the end of treatment because of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 30 patients, 19 patients (63.3%) had a VAS score improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them, nine (47.4%) showed a simultaneous grade improvement, and the other 10 patients (52.6%) had a stable grade according to NCI-CTCAE v3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> did not impair renal or liver function and did not interfere with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">Duloxetine</z:chebi> is feasible in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> OIPN with tolerable toxicity at a daily dose of 60 mg/day </plain></SENT>
