<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few data have been reported on its association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common known form of human genetic variation and may contribute to an increased susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to investigate whether the polymorphisms in the CTTN gene are associated with susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was performed to examine the relationship between the CTTN g.-9101C&gt;T, g.-8748C&gt;T, and g.72C&gt;T polymorphisms and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of g.-8748C&gt;T, g.-9101C&gt;T and Taqman analysis of g.72C&gt;T were performed on blood samples from 218 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 533 control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The g.-9101C&gt;T, g.-8748C&gt;T, and g.72C&gt;T SNPs in CTTN and their haplotypes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype and allele frequencies of g.-9101C&gt;T, g.-8748C&gt;T, and g.72C&gt;T did not differ between the patient group and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the haplotype of CTTN g.-9101C&gt;T, g.-8748C&gt;T, and g.72C&gt;T did not differ between patient group and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the genotype and allele frequencies of CTTN g.-9101C&gt;T were significantly increased in the lymph node positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CTTN g.-9101C&gt;T polymorphism may influence lymph node positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
