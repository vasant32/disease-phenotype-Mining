<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We used the fundamental cause hypothesis as a framework for understanding the creation of health disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality in the United States from 1968 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used negative binomial regression to analyze trends in county-level gender-, race-, and age-adjusted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality rates among individuals aged 35 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prior to 1980, there was a stable gradient in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality, with people living in counties of higher socioeconomic status (SES) being at greater risk than people living in lower SES counties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beginning in 1980, this gradient began to narrow and then reversed as people living in higher SES counties experienced greater reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality than those in lower SES counties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the fundamental cause hypothesis: once knowledge about prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> became available, social and economic resources became increasingly important in influencing mortality rates </plain></SENT>
