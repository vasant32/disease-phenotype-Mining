<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Unlike gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, the consequences of spleen damage during operative treatment of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> have barely been investigated, as splenectomy is not performed on these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patients to extend the radicality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context, the only interest is in the iatrogenic intraoperative spleen lesions, which make a splenectomy necessary or require reconstructive spleen preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: During the study period from January 2000 to the end of December 2004 the perioperative data of a prospective multicenter observational study of 46,682 Patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had been removed with a curative or palliative intent were analyzed with respect to the early postoperative consequences of an iatrogenic spleen lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of these 46,682 Patients, 640 (1.4%) suffered an iatrogenic spleen injury during the operative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spleens of 127 Patients (0.3%) were removed and the spleens of 513 Patients (1.1%) could be left in situ following repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In more than 80% of the cases with an iatrogenic spleen injury, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was localized in the left colon and in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that the decisive risk factor for this organ lesion was the mobilization of the left colonic flexure with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization in the left colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following spleen lesion a significantly higher morbidity rate was registered (47.2% following splenectomy, 48.5% following spleen repair) compared to patients without spleen injury (36.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic leaks requiring surgery were most frequently observed following splenectomy (7.9%) but this was significantly lower following spleen preservation (3.3%, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total hospital mortality was 3.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with splenectomy the hospital mortality was 11.8% and subsequent repair with organ preservation was 4.7% (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Iatrogenic spleen lesions during colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> surgery represent a significant risk factor for a poor early postoperative result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In particular, this concerns the high rate of anastomotic leaks and infectious septic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This also leads to a higher rate of total morbidity and hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By comparison significantly worse postoperative results were found in the group of splenectomised patients compared to the group with organ preservation through repair of the injured spleen </plain></SENT>
