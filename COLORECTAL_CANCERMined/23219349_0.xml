<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Standardized future liver remnant (sFLR) volume and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> after portal vein embolization (PVE) have been recognized as important predictors of surgical outcomes after major liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the regeneration rate of the FLR after PVE varies among individuals and its clinical significance is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Kinetic growth rate (KGR) is defined as the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> at initial volume assessment divided by number of weeks elapsed after PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 107 consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> with an sFLR volume &gt;20%, the ability of the KGR to predict overall and liver-specific postoperative morbidity and mortality was compared with sFLR volume and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the best cutoff values for sFLR volume, degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, and KGR for predicting postoperative hepatic insufficiency were estimated as 29.6%, 7.5%, and 2.0% per week, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these, KGR was the most accurate predictor (area under the curve 0.830 [95% CI, 0.736-0.923]; asymptotic significance, 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A KGR of &lt;2% per week vs â‰¥2% per week correlates with rates of hepatic insufficiency (21.6% vs 0%; p = 0.0001) and liver-related 90-day mortality (8.1% vs 0%; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of KGR was not influenced by sFLR volume or the timing of initial volume assessment when evaluated within 8 weeks after PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Kinetic growth rate is a better predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality after liver resection for small FLR than conventional measured volume parameters (ie, sFLR volume and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
