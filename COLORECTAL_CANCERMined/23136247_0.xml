<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We focused on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and genes relevant for its inhibition in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the CellSearch® system for CTC detection in peripheral blood samples from 49 patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (mCRC) and 32 patients with nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (nmCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed EGFR expression in 741 CTCs from 27 patients with mCRC and 6 patients with nmCRC using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-conjugated antibody with the CellSearch Epithelial Cell Kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA of a single CTC isolated by micromanipulation was propagated by whole-genome amplification and analyzed by quantitative PCR for EGFR gene amplification and sequencing for KRAS (v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene homolog), BRAF (v-raf murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene homolog B1), and PIK3CA (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28910">phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate</z:chebi> 3-kinase, catalytic subunit α) mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least 2 CTCs were detected in 24 of 49 patients with mCRC and 7 of 32 patients with nmCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 33 patients, CTCs with increased EGFR expression were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> in EGFR expression was observed between CTCs from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGFR gene amplification was found in 7 of 26 CTCs from 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The investigated BRAF gene locus was not mutated in 44 analyzed CTCs, whereas KRAS mutations were detected in 5 of 15 CTCs from 1 patient and PIK3CA mutations in 14 of 36 CTCs from 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Molecular characterization of single CTCs demonstrated considerable intra- and interpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of EGFR expression and genetic alterations in EGFR, KRAS, and PIK3CA, possibly explaining the variable response rates to EGFR inhibition in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
