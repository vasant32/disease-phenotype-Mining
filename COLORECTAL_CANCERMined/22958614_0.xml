<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to improve the prognosis by multidisciplinary evaluation and decision about surgical and oncological treatment, based on medical history, clinical examination, imaging, histology and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates the effect of the introduction of colorectal MDTs on 1 August 2004 in two Danish hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method  A retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing the outcome during the last 3 years before introduction of MDTs with the first 2 years after (the MDT cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> database, with follow-up recorded by the National Patient Registry in September 2010 was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end-points included the incidence of preoperative radiochemotherapy offered according to the national guidelines, R0/R1/R2 resection, postoperative mortality, local recurrence, distant recurrence and over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results  Eight hundred and eleven patients were diagnosed with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in Hvidovre and Bispebjerg hospitals between 1 May 2001 and 31 August 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of preoperative MRI scans increased in the MDT cohort and perioperative mortality decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More metachronous distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were found in the MDT cohort but there was no difference in overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion  There was an improved postoperative mortality but no other potential benefits for the patients were seen after the implementation of colorectal MDTs </plain></SENT>
