<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of an internet-based personalized decision support (PDS) tool designed to aid in the decision to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) using a fecal occult blood test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether the efficacy of the tool in influencing attitudes to screening was mediated by perceived usability and acceptability, and considered the role of computer self-efficacy and computer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in these relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-one participants aged 50-76 years worked through the on-line PDS tool and completed questionnaires on computer self-efficacy, computer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, attitudes to and beliefs about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening before and after exposure to the PDS, and perceived usability and acceptability of the tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA found that PDS exposure led to a significant increase in knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening, and more positive attitudes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening as measured by factors from the Preventive Health Model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perceived usability and acceptability of the PDS mediated changes in attitudes toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge), and computer self-efficacy and computer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were significant predictors of individuals' perceptions of the tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interventions designed to decrease computer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, such as computer courses and internet training, may improve the acceptability of new health information technologies including internet-based decision support tools, increasing their impact on behavior change </plain></SENT>
