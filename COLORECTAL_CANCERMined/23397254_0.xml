<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study were 454 patients, who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery between February 2007 and January 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 454 enrolled patients, 114 patients received Seprafilm(®), 180 patients received Adept(®), and 160 patients received no additive, based on the year of their surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small-bowel obstruction</z:e> were 8.8, 4.3, and 6.9 %, for the Adept(®), Seprafilm(®), and no additive (control) groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence was significantly higher in the Adept(®) group than in the Seprafilm(®) and control groups (Adept(®) vs. Seprafilm(®), P = 0.043; Adept(®) vs. control group, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between the Seprafilm group and the control group (P = 0.549) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adept(®) solution and Seprafilm(®) did not alter the liver and renal function, as assessed by blood chemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of Adept(®) significantly increased the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small-bowel obstruction</z:e> in patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
