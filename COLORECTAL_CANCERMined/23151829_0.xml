<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine if computed tomographic (CT) texture features of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are related to 5-year overall survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board waiver was obtained for this retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Texture features of the entire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> were assessed with contrast material-enhanced staging CT studies obtained in 57 patients as part of an ethically approved study and by using proprietary software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Entropy, uniformity, kurtosis, skewness, and standard deviation of the pixel distribution histogram were derived from CT images without filtration and with filter values corresponding to fine (1.0), medium (1.5, 2.0), and coarse (2.5) textures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and were censored at 5 years if they were still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the relationship, if any, between CT texture and 5-year overall survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess independence of texture parameters from stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 55 of 57 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were eight stage I, 19 stage II, 17 stage III, and 11 stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fine-texture feature Kaplan-Meier survival plots for entropy, uniformity, kurtosis, skewness, and standard deviation of the pixel distribution histogram were significantly different for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> above and below each respective threshold receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve optimal cutoff value (P = .001, P = .018, P = .032, P = .008, and P = .001, respectively), with poorer prognosis for ROC optimal values (a) less than 7.89 for entropy, (b) at least 0.01 for uniformity, (c) less than 2.48 for kurtosis, (d) at least -0.38 for skewness, and (e) less than 61.83 for standard deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that each parameter was independent from the stage predictor of overall survival rate (P = .001, P = .009, P = .006, P = .02, and P = .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fine-texture features are associated with poorer 5-year overall survival rate in patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
