<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the safety and efficacy of every 2 weeks I+C in patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with mCRC refractory to first-line fluoropyrimidine/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> regimens and not previously treated with I+C were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response rate (RR) was the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab 500 mg/m(2) and irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) were administered intravenously (I.V.) on day 1 every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient characteristics (n = 31): male (n = 17), median age 62; Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) â‰¤1 (n = 30), and PS = 2 (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median number of cycles = 3 (range, 1-22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>I+C doses were modified in 18 and 12 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 adverse events: acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (n = 6); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (n = 6); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (n = 5); there was one grade 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, possibly related to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a partial response, 11 had stable disease, and 18 had progressive disease resulting in an overall RR of 6% and disease control rate of 41.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) was 9.3 months (95% CI, 5.1-15), and time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) was 2.4 months (95% CI, 1.3-4.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>K-ras and BRAF mutations were detected in 39% and 9%, respectively, of the patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward longer <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> K-ras and BRAF (2.6 vs. 1.7 months; P = 0.16), and OS was significantly longer in those patients (14.1 vs. 5.5 months; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The RR and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> were lower than expected and may reflect the reduced dose intensity due to toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While the OS was consistent with previous publications, the efficacy of this combination was not demonstrated </plain></SENT>
