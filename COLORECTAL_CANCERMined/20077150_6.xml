<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present report we describe one such initiative aimed at enhancing the continuum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) care, including diagnosis, treatment and surveillance-the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Care Collaborative (C4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We describe the process and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> that led to two parallel quality improvement "collaboratives" that addressed (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and diagnostic follow-up and (2) the guideline concordance and timeliness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we discuss ongoing effort to spread lessons learned during the first stages of the project, which initially occurred at only a subset of VA facilities, throughout the VA health care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The description of this initiative is organized around key questions that must be answered when developing, sustaining and spreading multi-component quality improvement interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude with a discussion of lessons learned that we believe would apply to similar initiatives elsewhere, even if they address different clinical issues in health care settings with different organizational structures </plain></SENT>
