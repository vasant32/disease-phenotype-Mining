<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with delays to medical assessment and diagnosis for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Data were collected through a standardized questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical records were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When necessary, patients were contacted by a member of the study team to collect missing data and confirm information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Cross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute in Edmonton, Alta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Patients newly diagnosed with a histologically proven colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were identified and eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage at operation, symptom duration, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location were sought to identify factors associated with a delay in diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 93 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 49% of patients had symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> present for 1 month or less before seeing a physician, and 51% had symptoms for longer than 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five (86%) patients initially presented to family physicians for assessment, while 12 (14%) patients presented to the emergency department for their first physician encounters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 33 (38%) patients had digital rectal examinations during their first visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Women were more likely to present to physicians with longer than 1 month of symptoms, while men were more likely to present with less than 1 month of symptoms (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>Abdominal pain</z:hpo>, blood in the stool, and change in stool size were the most frequent symptoms encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (26%) patients delayed seeking treatment because they thought their symptoms were not serious and 12 (14%) believed that their family physicians had taken inappropriate action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (18%) patients attributed their delays to waiting too long for specialist referral and diagnostic tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study highlights the important role patients and physicians both play in delays in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Efforts to diminish future delays must focus on educating the public and practising physicians about important symptoms and signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the value of a digital rectal examination must be emphasized, along with continued promotion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
