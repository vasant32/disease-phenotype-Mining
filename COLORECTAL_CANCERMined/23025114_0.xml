<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to identify factors that may influence the development of postoperative complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following multivisceral resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 107 patients hospitalized in the Surgical Clinic III of Cluj-Napoca, who underwent multivisceral resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective study covering the period between 2006 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study compares the morbidity and mortality following multi-organ resections for locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with results in patients with uncomplicated colorectal resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study also highlights the impact that certain factors have on the development of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study shows a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and postoperative complications in the case of multiorgan resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences were found to be statistically significant as follows: postoperative complications: 26% after multiorgan resection and 14% after uncomplicated resection respectively (p = 0.001); postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>: 11% after multi-organ resection and 3% after uncomplicated resection respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The factors that have influenced in a negative way the postoperative evolution of the patients were: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, personal history of malignant disease, associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, major abdominal surgery prior enrolling, the number of resected organs and increased intraoperative blood loss (over 500 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In cases of locally advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, multiorgan resection should become the standard indication, as it offers patients their only chance of survival, comparable to that obtained in less advanced stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This indication is underlined by the high resecability rate (R0) accomplished in our service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative compensation of the associated pathologies, the surgery performed by experienced teams, as well as providing an adequate intensive care are required to reduce the postoperative risks </plain></SENT>
