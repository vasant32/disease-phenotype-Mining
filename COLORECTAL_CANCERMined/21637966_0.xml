<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that aberrations in cell cycle checkpoint controllers are a common feature in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and predict prognosis independent of stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study correlated two cell cycle regulators (p27 and p21) with clinical and pathological variables in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients to assess their role as prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 65 CRC patients were analyzed for p27 and p21 expression in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed positive nuclear p27 expression, whereas 72% of cases were completely p21 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between p27 and p21 expression and gender, age, lymph node involvement, stage, and grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, p27 (but not p21) expression revealed highly significant correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (p &lt; 0.01), depth of invasion (p &lt; 0.03), and lympho-vascular invasion (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> with high p27 expression showed a higher recurrence rate than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with no expression (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, there was a significant (p = 0.046) difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between p27-positive and p27-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in favor of the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p21 did not show any predictive value of DFS (p &lt; 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither p27 nor p21 did predict disease-specific survival (DSS) in Kaplan-Meier analysis, but DSS time was much shorter for p27-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate (Cox) model, p27 lost its value as independent predictor of DFS, and none of the covariates were independent predictors of DSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: p27 expression seems to be more powerful than p21 expression in providing useful prognostic information in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, particularly in predicting the patients at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Larger cohort and longer follow-up are needed to fully elucidate the value of p27 (and p21) as independent predictors of disease outcome </plain></SENT>
