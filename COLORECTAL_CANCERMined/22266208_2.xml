<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High affinity (K(D) = 10 pM toward PKAc) and unique optical properties of the probe enable its application for the measurement of picomolar concentrations of PKAc in the presence of high concentrations of other proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The described assay is applicable in the high-throughput format with the instrument setups designed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33319">lanthanide</z:chebi>-based time-gated (time-resolved) luminescence methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assay is used for demonstration that extracellular PKAc (ECPKA) is present in plasma samples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> healthy persons and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients but great care must be taken for procedures of treatment of blood samples to avoid disruption, damage, or activation of platelets in the course of plasma (or serum) preparation and conservation </plain></SENT>
