<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intensive medical treatment increases resection rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (MCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of liver metastasectomies was evaluated in patients with MCRC who were treated with previously reported FIr-B/FOx (triplet chemotherapy plus bevacizumab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with MCRC enrolled in the reported phase II study were classified according to involved metastatic sites (liver-only metastatic site, multiple metastatic sites) and the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (single, multiple) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical resectability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> was evaluated at baseline and every 3 cycles of FIr-B/FOx treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resection rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, activity, and efficacy were evaluated; progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared by using the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with liver MCRC were 33 of 50 consecutive unselected patients with MCRC: liver limited, 22 patients; multiple metastatic sites, 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liver metastasectomies were performed in 13 patients: 26% of 50 patients with MCRC, 39% of 33 patients with liver MCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with liver-only MCRC, a secondary liver surgery was performed in 54%: 6 of 9 single and 6 of 13 multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, 1 liver and lung metastasectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathologic complete responses were achieved in 2 patients (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The conversion rate of unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> was 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Objective response rate, PFS, OS were, respectively: 84%, 11 and 23 months in 33 liver MCRC; 86%, 17 and 44 months in 22 liver-limited patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PFS and OS were significantly increased in patients with liver-limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> compared with multiple metastatic sites and single compared with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FIr-B/FOx regimen may increase the resection rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and improve clinical outcome of patients with liver-only MCRC </plain></SENT>
