<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly standardized serum samples of patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (n = 59) and controls (n = 58) were collected at the University Hospital Leipzig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We based our investigations on amino acid screening profiles using electrospray tandem-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic profiles were evaluated using the Analyst 1.4.2 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>General, comparative and equivalence statistics were performed by R 2.12.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>11 out of 26 serum amino acid concentrations were significantly different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a model including CEA, glycine, and tyrosine as best discriminating and superior to CEA alone with an AUROC of 0.878 (95% CI 0.815-0.941) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our serum metabolic profiling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> revealed multiple significant disease-associated alterations in the amino acid profile with promising diagnostic power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further large-scale studies are necessary to elucidate the potential of our model also to discriminate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and potential differential diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, serum glycine and tyrosine in combination with CEA are superior to CEA for the discrimination between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
