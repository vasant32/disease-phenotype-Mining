<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Epidemiological studies have identified potentially modifiable risks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, including alcohol intake, diet and a sedentary lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Modelling these environmental factors alongside genetic risk is critical in obtaining accurate estimates of disease risk and improving our understanding of behavioural modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: 14 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms identified though GWAS studies and reported on by the international consortium COGENT were used to model <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> risk at a population level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six well validated environmental risks were selected for modelling together with the genetic risk factors (alcohol intake; smoking; exercise levels; BMI; fibre intake and consumption of red and processed meat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through a simulation study using risk modelling software, we assessed the potential impact of behavioural modifications on disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Modelling the genetic data alone leads to 24% of the population being classified as reduced risk; 60% average risk; 10% elevated risk and 6% high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adding alcohol consumption to the model reduced the elevated and high risk categories to 9% and 5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The simulation study suggests that a substantial proportion of individuals could reduce their disease risk profile by altering their behaviour, including reclassification of over 62% of heavy drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Modelling lifestyle factors alongside genetic risk can provide useful strategies to select individuals for screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Impact: Quantifying the impact of moderating behaviour, particularly related to alcohol intake and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> levels, is beneficial for informing health campaigns and tailoring prevention strategies </plain></SENT>
