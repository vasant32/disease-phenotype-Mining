<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the role of pre-treatment LDH serum levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients receiving first-line bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with first-line bevacizumab was eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A control group including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients treated with chemotherapy alone was also considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment LDH serum levels were collected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the control group for patients with high and low LDH levels was 4.2 and 8 months, respectively (P=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) was 19.6 and 34.9 months for patients with high and low LDH levels, respectively (P=0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the bevacizumab group, partial responses were seen in 14 (58%) high-LDH and 8 (14%) low-LDH patients (P=0.0243), respectively, median PFS was 7.3 and 8.5 months, respectively (P=0.2), and median OS was 22 and 26.6 months, respectively (P=0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High LDH levels correlated with worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab seemed capable of improving clinical outcome in this specific group of patients who usually present with an adverse natural history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improved response rate also suggests a role for LDH as a predictive marker </plain></SENT>
