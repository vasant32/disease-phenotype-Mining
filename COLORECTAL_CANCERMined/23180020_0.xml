<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High circulating IGF-1 levels are linked with an increased risk of colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, IGF-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), especially variant rs2946834, have been associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of IGF1 polymorphisms associated with IGF-1 plasma levels on event-free survival in patients with HER2-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study included 161 consecutive white patients with HER2-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was calculated as the time from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis to either relapse or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue samples; five IGF-1 polymorphisms (rs2946834, rs6220, rs1520220, rs5742694, and rs5742678), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with IGF-1 levels, were genotyped by SNaPshot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a poorer clinical outcome for carriers of the rare allele of SNP rs2946834 (log-rank test, p = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concordantly, in univariate Cox regression analyses, the rare allele of SNP rs2946834 was significantly associated with a decreased event-free survival (HR = 3.06 [1.14-8.22]; p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis adjusted for age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage confirmed this result (HR = 4.02 [1.36-11.90]; p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other investigated polymorphisms of the IGF1 gene were not significantly associated with event-free survival (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p values &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides first evidence that IGF1 rs2946834 polymorphism is associated with clinical outcome of HER2-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to validate these findings </plain></SENT>
