<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab added to chemotherapy further improves progression-free (PFS) survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> has been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies involving bevacizumab, we retrospectively analysed the correlation between the modifications of arterial blood pressure and response rate (RR) and PFS in mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically proven mCRC receiving a first-line chemotherapeutic treatment were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure was measured daily and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> graduated according to NCI-CTC V3.0 scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were considered for the present analysis; median age was 57 years (range 31-80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven patients had undergone surgery on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> and, of these, 19 patients had formerly received adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapeutic regimens for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were FOLFIRI (61 patients), FOLFOXIRI (6 patients), XELOX (5 patients) and XELIRI (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (24.3%) had basal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (17.6%) developed G2-G4 arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six complete (8.1%) and 31 partial (41.9%) responses were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among patients with induced arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 84.6% achieved a complete or partial response, as compared with 42.6% of patients who did not show this side effect (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in median PFS for patients with induced arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (15.1 vs. 8.3 months, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that bevacizumab-related arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may represent a predictive factor of response and prolonged PFS in patients with mCRC receiving first-line bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
