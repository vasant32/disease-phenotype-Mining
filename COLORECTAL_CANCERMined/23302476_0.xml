<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyze the survival outcomes of the surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRCLM), and study the mode of multi-disciplinary team (MDT) for CRCLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The retrospective analysis was conducted for 38 patients with CRCLM received MDT management and surgical treatment from January 2009 to August 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peri-operative and survival outcomes of MDT and surgery were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases met the present criteria of resetability for CRCLM, but only 4 cases (10.5%) met the previous one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coloproctectomy and hepatectomy were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with 39 colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and 155 liver lesions removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342957" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postoperative septic shock</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colorectal and hepatic specific complications were absent in the others patients except one case of biliary leak which was treated with conservative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was arranged in 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered for every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of (22 Â± 10) months according to the finding time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, recurrence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were observed in 16 cases and 6 cases died of late-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 2- and 3-overall survival rate were 94.4%, 85.3% and 75.8% respectively, and the 1-, 2- and 3-disease-free survival rate were 70.1%, 54.2% and 54.2% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MDT mode for resectable CRCLM is recommendable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection of CRCLM is feasible and safe, which seems to achieve favourable short-middle oncologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>And long-term survival is expected </plain></SENT>
