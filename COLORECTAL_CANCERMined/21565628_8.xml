<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: MicroRNAs (miRNA) can act as oncogenes or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms present in pri-, pre- and mature miRNAs can potentially modulate the expression of hundreds of genes, broadly affecting miRNA function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Notably, the rs11614913 SNP in miR-196a2 has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, but its association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a case-control study to investigate the genetic association between this functional SNP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped the rs11614913 SNP in 252 CRC patients and 543 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined miR-196a expression level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues (n = 50) obtained from the studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequency of the CC genotype was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients than controls, implying that the subjects with the CC genotype or C allele containing genotypes (CT and CC) have a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant association between this polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis revealed that rs11614913 CC or carrying at least one C allele was associated with a significantly increased level of mature miR-196a (p = 0.010 or = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides the first evidence that miR-196a2 polymorphism may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility in a Chinese population through modulating mature miR-196a expression </plain></SENT>
