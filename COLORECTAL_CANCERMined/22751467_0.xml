<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Some studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) is associated with a reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, more recent population-based studies suggest no protective association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review that focused on non-referral studies to reassess the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> for this indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases for studies of non-referral populations that assessed the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> use for at least 1 year and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> between 1966 and 2011 and conducted a quantitative meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four observational studies fulfilled inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pooled adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-1.38), but there was moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (I2 = 58.2%; P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A sensitivity analysis that included a fifth study in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> use was only for a minimum of 3 months yielded a pooled aOR of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.54-1.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A series of sensitivity analyses in which each of the four studies was excluded one at a time did not show any significant change in the overall pooled OR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conducted a separate meta-analysis of nine clinic-based studies, which, in contrast, yielded a pooled OR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.45-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis yielded inconsistent results that were dependent on the inclusion of either non-referral or clinic-based populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on non-referral studies, there does not seem to be a protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among these studies limits their interpretation </plain></SENT>
