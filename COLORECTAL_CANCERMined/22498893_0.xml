<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The perioperative blood loss during surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> relates to the risk for complications and early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> between 1997 and 2003 in the health-care region of Uppsala/Ã–rebro were prospectively registered at the regional oncological center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on patients who underwent radical surgery for stages I to III disease were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who died within 6 months after surgery were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios were calculated with uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of covariation, blood loss, blood transfusion, and complications were tested in separate multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood loss of 250 mL or more during surgery, male gender, occurrence of complications, age more than 75 years, and stage III disease were risk factors for overall mortality in the uni- and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perioperative blood transfusion was shown to be a risk factor in the univariate analysis only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that degree of blood loss during surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> is a factor that influences long-term survival </plain></SENT>
