<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have proposed that methylated DNA from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells is released into the circulation and might be widely used as a marker for non-invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Catalytic activities of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism-related enzymes and adequate synthesis of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> donors are important elements for the cellular methylation reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we sought to determine the following: i) genotype frequencies of MTHFR and MTR involved in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism in cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free controls; and ii) the methylation status of three candidate genes (p16INK4A, p73 and hMLH1) in plasma related to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From genotype frequency analysis, individuals homozygous for the MTHFR 677TT genotype had a significantly reduced risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared with those harboring the MTHFR 677CC genotype (OR, 0.206; 95% CI, 0.070-0.604; P=0.005), and had a lower plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentration than those with the MTHFR 677CC+CT genotype (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using methylation-specific PCR, p73 was shown to be more frequently methylated in the high <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> group [50% (8 of 16)] than in the medium [16.7% (3 of 18)] or low <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> subgroups [11.1% (2 of 18)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, subjects with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype appeared to have a significantly lower risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> than those with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, and the methylation status of circulating p73 genomic DNA was substantially altered by the plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
