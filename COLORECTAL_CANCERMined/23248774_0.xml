<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The assessment of serosal involvement, which may be relevant to pT4, can be challenging for pathologists, making the consistency of diagnoses questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As solutions to this problem, the following two strategies could be adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One would be to use special staining or immunohistochemical staining techniques for diagnostic assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other would be to construct recommendations for the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spreading and to obtain a world-wide consensus on the criteria used to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spreading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using elastic staining, we previously reported that peritoneal elastic laminal invasion (ELI) could be objectively determined and would likely contribute to a simplified and more objective stratification of deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion around the peritoneal surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also noted the importance of sampling, staining, and histo-anatomical knowledge in the application of elastic staining during routine pathological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we review the history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> stratification leading to the present TNM classification and report on the current status of pathological assessments made at our hospital to summarize what has been established and what is further required for the pathological diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spreading in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
