<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: CD24 expression is associated with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous data indicated that CD24 promoted the proliferation and invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells through the activation of ERK1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since Src family kinases are frequently deregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and closely related to the MAPK signaling pathway, we investigated the impact of Lyn, an important member of SFKs, on CD24-induced ERK1/2 activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The interaction of CD24 and Lyn was identified by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and ectopic expression of CD24-induced Lyn activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Lyn activation by phosphatase PP2 in SW480CD24cells abrogated CD24-induced invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the Co-IP and immunofluorescence assay revealed that overexpression of CD24 enhanced the interaction of Lyn and ERK1/2 and induced the nuclear translocation of Lyn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, inhibition of Lyn activity attenuated CD24-induced ERK1/2 activation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD24 disrupted Lyn-ERK1/2 interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry analysis for 202 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> showed that the expression of both CD24 and Lyn was positively correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade, stage, lymph node and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower expression of CD24 or Lyn had a higher survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Cox multivariate analysis showed that CD24 expression, but not Lyn expression, was an independent prognostic factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Lyn is involved in CD24-induced ERK1/2 activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD24 is associated with activation of Lyn and ERK1/2, which might be a novel mechanism related to CD24-mediated regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
