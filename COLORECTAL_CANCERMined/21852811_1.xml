<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Osteopontin (OPN) is a small integrin-binding N-linked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, which plays a crucial role in the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to suppress Opn expression by an antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO(Opn)) to decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of ASO(Opn) was investigated in vitro in CC531(lacZ) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells in comparison to sense (SO) or nonsense (NSO) oligomers, by determining <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels, as well as cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For in vivo treatment, CC531(lacZ) cells were intraportally inoculated into rats to compare the effects of ASO, SO and NSO oligomers, following prolonged subcutaneous administration by osmotic mini-pumps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting CC531(lacZ) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell load in the liver was measured by a Î²-galactosidase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of CC531(lacZ) cells in vitro was significantly decreased after ASO(Opn) and SO treatment (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Liver metastasis</z:e> development was reduced as long as ASO(Opn) was administered, but this effect was rapidly blunted following the end of the ASO(Opn) administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, administration of the SO resulted in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load reduction, which surprisingly surpassed the ASO(Opn) effect in vivo in terms of a long-lasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> suppression, which was accompanied with increased survival of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of the ASO(Opn) in rats was effective in decreasing their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The short-lived effect might be extended by modifications suited to increase the ASOs' half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a superior anti-metastatic effect caused by the SO, which has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
