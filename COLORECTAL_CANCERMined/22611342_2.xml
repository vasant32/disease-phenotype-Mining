<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Failure to remove the mesorectal fat envelope entirely may explain part of observed local and distant recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies suggest quality of the mesorectum after TME surgery as determined by pathological evaluation may influence prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the prognostic value of the plane of surgery as well as factors influencing the likelihood of a high-quality specimen by reviewing the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A pooled meta-analysis of relevant outcome data was performed where appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A muscularis propria resection plane was found to increase the risk of local recurrence (RR 2.72 [95 % CI 1.36 to 5.44]) and overall recurrence (RR 2.00 [95 % CI 1.17 to 3.42]) compared to an (intra)mesorectal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plane of surgery is an important factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> treatment and the documentation by pathologists is essential for the improvement of TME quality and patient outcome </plain></SENT>
