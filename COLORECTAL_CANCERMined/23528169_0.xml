<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic agents are monoclonal antibodies targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene aberrations in the EGFR-induced pathways are negative predictors of therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Determination of -non-mutated KRAS is a requirement for the indication of targeted anti-EGFR therapy in the present time, BRAF mutation analysis is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of our results with published data and verification of routine laboratory methods in relation to diagnostic kits were the purposes of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients and Methods: In addition to routine methods based on PCR, direct sequencing as well as two diagnostic kits for KRAS (codon 12 and 13) and BRAF (codon 600) mutation analysis were used for 132 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: KRAS mutations were detected in 45 patients (34%), V600E mutation of the BRAF gene in 9 patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both mutations simultaneously were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissues from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were available from 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation was detected in 13 cases of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were of the same type in 9 patients; types of mutation in both tissues were different in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation only in one tissue was detected in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation in both tissues was detected in the 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A low percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in 17 patients specimen did not allow performance of routine analysis and diagnostic kit was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The frequency of KRAS and BRAF mutations in our cohort of patients corresponds to published data </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>KRAS analysis requires a comprehensive methodological approach with regard to reduced DNA quality and different percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For this reason, commercial diagnostic kits constitute a suitable supplement to standard methods </plain></SENT>
