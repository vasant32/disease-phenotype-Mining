<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Predictors of survival usually include disease-free interval, histology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and complete resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to report the outcomes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> submitted to surgical resection, and to identify prognostic factors that significantly affect overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 120 patients with previously treated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> that had developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e>, admitted between 1990 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The log-rank and Breslow tests were used to compare survival differences for each variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses to determine the independent prognostic factors for overall survival were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model as identified by the univariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up was 20.3 months (range: 3.27-134.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients included in this study underwent a total of 165 thoracotomies (mean of 1.37 thoracotomies/patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 34.73 months, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 24.39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses identified unilateral lesions, neoadjuvant chemotherapy at lung resection and complete resection as independent prognostic factors for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that prognostic factors identified in studies on pulmonary metastasectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> should be interpreted carefully for patients with possibility of pulmonary metastasectomy from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
