<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, previous ginseng anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> observations were largely focused on ginseng parent compounds but not metabolites, and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> studies on C-K were limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the anti-proliferative effects of C-K when compared to those of Rb1, and the related mechanisms of action, in HCT-116 and SW-480 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of Rb1 and C-K on the proliferation of HCT-116 and SW-480 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells were compared using an MTS assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle and cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were assayed using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic activities of caspases were determined by colorimetric assay, and interactions of C-K and caspases were explored by docking analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C-K showed significant anti-proliferative effects in HCT-116 and SW-480 cells at concentrations of 30-50 ÂµM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the same concentrations, Rb1 did not show any effects, while C-K arrested the cells in the G1 phase, and significantly induced cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to HCT-116 (p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>), the p53 mutant cell line SW-480 was more sensitive to C-K as assessed by cell cycle regulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C-K activated expression of caspases 8 and 9, consistent with docking analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The docking data suggested that C-K forms hydrogen bonds with Lys253, Thr904 and Gly362 in caspase 8, and with Thr62, Ser63 and Arg207 in caspase 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>C-K, but not its parent ginsenoside Rb1, showed significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that C-K could be a potentially effective anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> agent </plain></SENT>
