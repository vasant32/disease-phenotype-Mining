<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, the molecular characterization of CTC from mCRC patients was approached, with the aim of understanding their biology and improving their clinical utility in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this, EpCAM-based immunoisolation of CTC was combined with whole transcriptome amplification and hybridization onto cDNA microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression data from mCRC patients, once the background of unspecific immunoisolation from a group of controls had been subtracted, resulted in 410 genes that characterized the CTC population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics were used for the biological interpretation of the data, revealing that CTC are characterized by genes related to cell movement and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and proliferation, and cell signalling and interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RTqPCR on an independent series of mCRC patients and controls was used for the validation of a number of genes related to the main cellular functions characterizing the CTC population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison between primary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> further involved the CTC-genes in the promotion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the correlation of CTC-gene expression with clinical parameters demonstrated detection and prognosis significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the molecular characterization of CTC from mCRC patients and the identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers represent an innovative and promising approach in the clinical management of this type of patients </plain></SENT>
