<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a 61-year-old woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was on surveillance when incidentally she was discovered to have multiple bilateral lung nodules on imaging; the largest was surgically removed for histological examination </plain></SENT>
