<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several OCT4 isoforms are differentially expressed in human pluripotent and non-pluripotent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reactivation of OCT4 expression is postulated to occur in differentiated cells that have undergone <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine OCT4 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) tissues, and to assess the efficacy of OCT4 as a potential biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, in this study, we investigated its expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues, evaluated its relationship to various clinicopathological parameters and defined the isoform of OCT4 that was found to be expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Primary tumor</z:e> tissues and matching adjacent non-cancerous tissues were obtained from 84 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OCT4 expression and isoform determination were documented by reverse transcription-PCR and real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OCT4, Sox-2, and NANOG localization were performed using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The isoforms expressed in the studied cases were confirmed by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty biopsy specimens representing healthy tissues, retrieved from colonoscopy were studied in parallel as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OCT4 expression levels were higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues compared to matching, adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the levels of OCT4 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OCT4 and Sox-2 were localized in the nuclei and the cytoplasm of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases, we found that the OCT4B1 isoform is expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of OCT4B1 was found in poorly and moderately differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the data imply that OCT4B1 isoform may represent a potential biomarker for the initiation, progression, and differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
