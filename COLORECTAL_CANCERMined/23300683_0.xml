<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> substantially impairs drug effectiveness and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subtype of mismatch repair deficient (MMR-D) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, accounting for about 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, shows particular differential responses up to resistance towards currently approved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-clinical in vitro models representing molecular features of MMR-D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are thus mandatory for identifying biomarkers that finally help to predict responses towards new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the successful establishment and characterization of three patient-derived MMR-D cell lines (HROC24, HROC87, and HROC113) along with their corresponding xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: MMR-D cell lines (HROC24, HROC87, and HROC113) were established from a total of ten clinicopathological well-defined MMR-D cases (120 CRC cases in total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells were comprehensively characterized by phenotype, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, growth kinetics, invasiveness, and molecular profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, response to clinically relevant chemotherapeutics was examined in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two MMR-D lines showing CIMP-H derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (HROC24: K-ras(wt), B-raf(mut), HROC87: K-ras(wt), B-raf(mut)), whereas the HROC113 cell line (K-ras(mut), B-raf(wt)) was HNPCC-associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A diploid DNA-status could be verified by flow cytometry and SNP Array analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines were characterized as epithelial (EpCAM(+)) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, showing surface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker expression (CEACAM(+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MHC-class II was inducible by Interferon-Î³ stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Growth kinetics as well as invasive potential was quite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> between individual lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Besides, MMR-D cell lines exhibited distinct responsiveness towards chemotherapeutics, even when comparing in vitro and in vivo sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These newly established and well-characterized, low-passage MMR-D cell lines provide a useful tool for future investigations on the biological characteristics of MMR-D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, both of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and hereditary origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, matched patient-derived immune cells allow for comparative genetic studies </plain></SENT>
