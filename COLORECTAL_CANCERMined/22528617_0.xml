<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have witnessed delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) care in this population and sought to identify demographic and systemic differences in these patients compared to those in an insured health-care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND APPROACH/MEASUREMENTS: We collected demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data from 2005-2007 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> seen at Parkland Health and Hospital System (PHHS), a safety-net health system and at Presbyterian Hospital Dallas System (Presbyterian), a community health system, and compared characteristics among the two health-care systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with advanced stage were identified with multivariate logistic regression analysis and odds ratios were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred and eighteen patients at PHHS and 397 patients at Presbyterian with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An overwhelming majority (75 %) of patients seen at the safety-net were diagnosed after being seen in the emergency department or at an outside facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients had a higher percentage of stage 4 disease compared to the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients within the safety-net with Medicare/private insurance had lower rates of advanced disease than uninsured patients (25 % vs. 68 %, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insurance status and physician encounter resulting in diagnosis were independent predictors of disease stage at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients seen in the safety-net health system were transferred from outside systems after diagnosis, thus leading to delayed care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This delay in care drove advanced stage at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data point to a pervasive and systematic issue in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and have fundamental health policy implications for population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
