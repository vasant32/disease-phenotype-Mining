<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite-stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) samples (n = 269) had 66 minimal common CNA regions, with frequent gains on 20 q (72.5%), 7 (41.8%), 8 q (33.1%) and 13 q (51.0%) and losses on 18 (58.6%), 4 q (26%) and 21 q (21.6%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal aberrations identified by the GISTIC method confirmed amplifications of oncogenes including EGFR, ERBB2, CCND1, MET, and MYC, and deletions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors including TP53, APC, and SMAD4, and gene expression was highly concordant with copy number aberration for these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Novel amplicons included putative oncogenes such as WNK1 and HNF4A, which also showed high concordance between copy number and expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis associated a specific patient segment featured by chromosome 20 q gains to an improved overall survival, which might be due to higher expression of genes such as EEF1B2 and PTK6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CNA clustering also grouped <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> characterized by a poor prognosis BRAF-mutant-like signature derived from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> data from this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further revealed non-random correlation between CNAs among unlinked loci, including positive correlation between 20 q gain and 8 q gain, and 20 q gain and chromosome 18 loss, consistent with co-selection of these CNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results reinforce the non-random nature of somatic CNAs in stage-II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and highlight loci and genes that may play an important role in driving the development and outcome of this disease </plain></SENT>
