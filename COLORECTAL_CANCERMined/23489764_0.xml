<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This was a prospective study of consecutive patients with left sided obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> treated between January 2005 and June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SEMS placement was attempted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery was reserved for patients in whom a stent placement failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After successful decompression, surgery was offered to patients with potentially curable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were included, with successful SEMS placement in 60/77 (78%) patients, 25 as a bridge to surgery and 35 for palliation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immediate complications occurred in two (3%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 35 patients in whom SEMS was for palliation, 32(91%) avoided surgery altogether </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A stoma was fashioned in 5 (8.3%) of the 60 patients who were successfully stented, and in 12 (71%) of the 17 patients in whom stenting failed (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
