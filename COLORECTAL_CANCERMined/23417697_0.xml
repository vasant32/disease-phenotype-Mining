<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of various clinical factor and survival was examined in this retrospective cohort analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical data from 220 previously untreated patients with mCRC, not progressive at the end of standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into two subgroups: those given with maintenance bevacizumab: "maintenance bevacizumab cohort (n = 118; MB)", and those discontinuing bevacizumab as a result of physician's or patient's decision: "no maintenance bevacizumab cohort (n = 102; noMB)" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The baseline factors were well balanced between the study subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median PFS and OS for the general population was 10 months (range 7-15) and 22.5 months (range 18-26), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 13 and 8 months in the BM and noBM cohorts, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, maintenance therapy resulted independently associated with improved PFS (HR 1.73; p &lt; 0.001), but only objective response (OR) after first-line chemotherapy was associated with improved OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maintenance chemotherapy cannot be considered a standard of care after induction chemotherapy for mCRC, because the optimal balance between efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy remains a significant challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of our retrospective study suggest that maintenance therapy with bevacizumab is a safe and valuable option, particularly in those patients achieving an objective response after first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
