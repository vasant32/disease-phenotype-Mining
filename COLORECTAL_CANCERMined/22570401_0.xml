<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is generally considered a safe procedure, complications during colonoscopy may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most serious complication is iatrogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although rare, it can be potentially lethal, especially when it is not recognized and treated immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The traditional management of iatrogenic colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> is surgical repair, either by laparotomy or laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, with the recent improvement of endoscopic devices and techniques, endoscopic repair of iatrogenic colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> using endoclips is considered to be both feasible and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We successfully used endoscopic clipping to treat a patient with a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the colon during diagnostic colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe that the endoscopic repair avoids unnecessary surgery and reduces medical costs </plain></SENT>
