<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent years have witnessed enormous progress in our understanding of the genetic predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Estimates suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or most genetic susceptibility mechanisms proposed so far, ranging from high-penetrance genes to low-risk alleles, account for about 60% of the population-attributable fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this context, there is increasing interest in the gene encoding the transforming growth factor Î² receptor 1 (TGFBR1); first when over a decade ago a common polymorphism in exon 1 (rs11466445, TGFBR1*6A/9A) was suggested to be a risk allele for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, then when linkage studies identified the chromosomal region where the gene is located as susceptibility locus for familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and more recently when the allele-specific expression (ASE) of the gene was proposed as a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Published data on the association of TGFBR1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, regarding polymorphisms and ASE and including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and familial forms of the disease, are often contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review gives a general overview of the most relevant studies in order to clarify the role of TGFBR1 in the field of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> genetic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
