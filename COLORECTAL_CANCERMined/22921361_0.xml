<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since endogenous nitrosation has been hypothesised as a plausible origin for the association between red and processed meat intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, a highly sensitive, fast and specific quantitative assay is needed to correlate the dose of individual DNA adducts with the effects of food consumption and individual digestive and metabolic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) assay for quantitation of O⁶-MeG and O⁶-CMG, using the deuterated analogues as internal standards (ISTD), was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples of calf thymus DNA containing O⁶-MeG and O⁶-CMG were purified by acid hydrolysis and solid phase extraction prior to quantification by UHPLC-MS/MS in the selected reaction monitoring mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method was successfully validated in terms of repeatability (RSD&lt;10%), reproducibility (RSD&lt;15%) and linearity (99.9%) by incubating 0.1mg calf thymus DNA with the known N-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35800">nitroso compound</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> diazoacetate (KDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The limit of quantitation was 30 fmol mg⁻¹ DNA for O⁶-MeG or 1 adduct per 10⁸ <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> and 50 fmol mg⁻¹ DNA for O⁶-CMG or 1.7 adducts per 10⁸ <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the method was applied to human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29, treated with KDA to illustrate its capability to quantify O⁶-MeG and O⁶-CMG DNA adducts using biological relevant models in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This method will support further research to unravel the mechanistic basis of endogenous nitrosation processes upon consumption of red and processed meat products </plain></SENT>
