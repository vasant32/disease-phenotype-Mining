<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors studied blood coagulation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and evaluated some prothrombotic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed by latex-aglutination method, ProC Global test, Asserachrom PAI-1 test and Enzygnost F 1+2 test the group of 137 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor of colon</z:e> and rectum, drew attention to the relationship between level of D-dimer, PAI-1, F 1+2, Protein C and the progress of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e>, its localization, clinical stage, histopathology type, method of surgery considering the stapling use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Very aggressive and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have significantly higher level of D-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prothrombotic fragments 1+2 were significantly higher by anastomosis dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein C level was lower in the age from sixty to seventy and in advanced clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative surveys of D-dimer, PAI-1, prothrombotic fragments and Protein C give informations about risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of malignant diseases, their clinical stage and histological type </plain></SENT>
