<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three miRNA variants and four variants in the miRNA binding sites were selected based on allelic frequencies, while their potential impact has been described in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tissues of 344 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent curative surgery and genotyping analyses were performed using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among seven target variants, rs1044129 at the miR-367 binding site of calcium channel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor gene 3 (RYR3) was associated with relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients as a recessive model in a univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a multivariate analysis revealed that patients carrying the GG genotype had poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>, compared to those with the AA or AG genotype (hazard ratio, HR=2.864; p=0.005), yet there was only a marginal trend for disease-specific survival (HR=2.226; p=0.087) regardless of patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that the functional variant (rs1044129) in the miR-367 binding site of RYR3 may be a potential marker for prognosis in patients following curative surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
