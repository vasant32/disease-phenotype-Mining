<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patient-provider language barriers may play a role in health-care disparities, including obtaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Professional interpreters and language-concordant providers may mitigate these disparities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND MAIN MEASURES: We performed a retrospective cohort study of individuals age 50 years and older who were categorized as English-Concordant (spoke English at home, n = 21,594); Other Language-Concordant (did not speak English at home but someone at their provider's office spoke their language, n = 1,463); or Other Language-Discordant (did not speak English at home and no one at their provider's spoke their language, n = 240) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression assessed the association of language concordance with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Compared to English speakers, non-English speakers had lower use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (30.7% vs 50.8%; OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.51-0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the English-Concordant group, the Language-Discordant group had similar screening (adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.58-1.21), while the Language-Concordant group had lower screening (adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening are lower in individuals who do not speak English at home compared to those who do </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the Language-Discordant cohort had similar rates to those with English concordance, while the Language-Concordant cohort had lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may be due to unmeasured differences among the cohorts in patient, provider, and health care system characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that providers should especially promote the importance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening to non-English speaking patients, but that language barriers do not fully account for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rate disparities in these populations </plain></SENT>
