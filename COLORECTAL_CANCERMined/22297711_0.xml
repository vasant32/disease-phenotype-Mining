<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty participants 50 years or older, not up-to-date with current recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines, were recruited from a primary care clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A semi-structured interview focused on aspects of preparing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening was administered; after transcription, researchers used triangulation and consensus to identify relevant themes and concepts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four main themes were identified that dealt with issues important for both FOBT and colonoscopy planning: personal concerns, reminders, communication with healthcare providers and obtaining test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FOBT specific themes included: sample collection and return </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For colonoscopy screening, themes included: scheduling, intervention questions, colonoscopy preparation, and transportation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These can be classified as barrier, process and accessory themes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The developed computer-administered implementation intentions algorithm addressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the identified concerns in a planned and sequential manner, in order to facilitate planning for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that appropriate reminders, explanations of procedures, and patient understanding of temporary life disruptions, help patients develop and accept a detailed screening plan </plain></SENT>
