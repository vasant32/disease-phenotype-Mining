<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: To determine the frequency of HER-2 overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients, and to explore the relationship between clinicopathological prognostic factors and their effects on survival, based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: The study included 80 patients with a histologically proven diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> that received adjuvant FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy at our department between March 2006 and September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient data were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: The median follow-up period and age of the patients were 24 months and 59 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In immunohistochemical staining, 3+ staining was found in 2 patients (2.5%) while 2+ was in 13 (16%)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH for HER-2 was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these 15 patients; samples which were 3+ showed positivity but the ones with 2+ were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between HER-2 expression and age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization, histological subtype, grade, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, or pTN stage (P&gt;0.05), even when the patients with HER-2 overexpression were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant relationship between progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and HER-2 expression, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization, obstruction-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, histological type, grade, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, or pT staging (P&gt;0.05); however, there was a significant relationship between lymph node involvement, and PFS and OS (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Evaluation of HER-2 overexpression in a more comprehensive, multi-center, prospective trial with standardized methods will be an appropriate approach </plain></SENT>
