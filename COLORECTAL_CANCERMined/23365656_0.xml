<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, phage display has become widely used for many applications, including ligand generation for targeted imaging, drug delivery and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we developed a panning procedure using a phage display <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> library to select a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that specifically binds to the VPAC1 receptor to develop a novel targeted probe for molecular imaging and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1 cells stably expressing VPAC1 receptors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1/VPAC1 cells) were used to select a VPAC1-binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> from a 12-mer phage <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing and homologous analysis of the randomly selected phage clones were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cellular ELISA was used to determine the most selectively binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> for further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding specificity to the VPAC1 receptor was analyzed by competitive inhibition ELISA and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The binding ability of the selected <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1/VPAC1 cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant enrichment of phages that specifically bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1/VPAC1 cells was obtained after four rounds of panning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the selected phage clones, 16 out of 60 shared the same <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence, GFRFGALHEYNS, which we termed the VP2 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VP2 and vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (VIP) competitively bound to the VPAC1 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More importantly, we confirmed that VP2 specifically bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1/VPAC1 cells and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the VP2 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> could specifically bind to VPAC1 receptor and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>And VP2 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> may be a potential candidate to be developed as a useful diagnostic molecular imaging probe for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
