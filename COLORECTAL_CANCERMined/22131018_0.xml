<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether PRL-3-induced enhancement of migration and invasion is dependent on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), PRL-3 was expressed in DLD-1 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The motility, migration and invasion characteristics of the cells were examined, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastasis to the lung</z:e> was confirmed in a <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse using PRL-3-overexpressing DLD-1 cells [DLD-1 (PRL-3)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Migration and invasion of the cells were inhibited by phosphatase and farnesyltransferase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of MMPs was enhanced 3- to 10-fold in comparison to control cells, and migration and invasion were partially inhibited by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) knockdown of MMP-2, -13 or -14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, siRNA knockdown of MMP-7 completely inhibited the migration and invasion of DLD-1 (PRL-3) cells, whereas overexpression of MMP-7 increased migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of MMP-7 was also downregulated by phosphatase and farnesyltransferase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found that PRL-3 induced MMP-7 through oncogenic pathways including PI3K/AKT and ERK and that there is a relationship between the expression of PRL-3 and MMP-7 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of MMP-13 and -14 was very sensitive to the inhibition of farnesyltransferase; however, the migration and invasion of DLD-1 (PRL-3) cells did not strongly depend on the expression of MMP-13 or -14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the migration and invasion of PRL-3-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells depends primarily on the expression of MMP-7 </plain></SENT>
