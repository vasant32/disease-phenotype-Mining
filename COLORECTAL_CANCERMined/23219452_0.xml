<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess whether chemotherapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is consistently observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and to identify the areas of cognition affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The meta-analysis included 13 studies and examined the effects of chemotherapy on seven different cognitive domains, across five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was the intention of this meta-analysis to stringently exclude many studies, allowing for examination of cognition in carefully selected studies of chemotherapy recipients who do not have current mood or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> diagnoses (or psychiatric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740858" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">substance abuse</z:e> histories), without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain cancer</z:e> and who have not had radiotherapy or hormone treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A moderator analysis examined whether patient age, treatment duration and time since treatment end significantly contributed to chemotherapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evidence for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment was established for executive function and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and time since treatment cessation but a significant negative relationship was found for treatment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age had no impact on treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Future research must be conducted on chemotherapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, which have received a moderate amount of attention and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, which has received little attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This would enable us to determine the extent to which chemotherapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is a universal phenomenon associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> experience and its treatment regardless of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
