<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, nearly a third of stage III patients still recur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The positive results of cetuximab and bevacizumab added to chemotherapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> formed the basis to explore the role of these agents in the adjuvant setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, two adjuvant trials with bevacizumab and one adjuvant trial with cetuximab have failed to show any benefit of adding these agents to standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although reasons for the negative results remain unknown, the divergent effects of bevacizumab and cetuximab in early- versus advanced stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon-cancer</z:hpo> reinforce the notion that adjuvant and metastatic settings represent distinct diseases that require different treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article summarizes the results of the adjuvant bevacizumab and cetuximab trials and discusses the possible explanations why molecularly targeted agents had no impact on improving the outcomes of adjuvant treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
