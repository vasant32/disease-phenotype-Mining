<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The ability of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (FDG-PET) to impact on management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, direct impact of FDG-PET on surgical management of patients with potentially resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FDG-PET scans of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at Austin Hospital in a 2-year period were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on patient demographics, scan indication and sites of disease pre- and post-PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of standard imaging tests and FDG-PET scans were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potential impact of FDG-PET on proposed surgical management plans was assessed by an experienced surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 585 FDG-PET scans performed on 470 patients (309M : 161F, mean age 61.9 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Hepatic metastases</z:e> were identified on standard imaging in 232 (39.7%) patients, and FDG-PET confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> in 203 cases, including 22 cases with new lesions, and clarified presence of disease in 34/37 (92%) cases with equivocal standard imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 54 patients, FDG-PET was performed for disease assessment before hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET had substantial management plan impact in 36/54 (66.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET can profoundly impact on the management plan of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who may be suitable for hepatic metastectomy </plain></SENT>
