<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 23 healthy donors and 13 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with cetuximab were tested for FcγR polymorphisms and cetuximab-mediated ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ADCC was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">chromium-51</z:chebi> release on a epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 86 mCRC patients were genotyped for study purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBMCs harbouring the FcγRIIIa 158 V/V genotype had a significantly higher cetuximab-mediated ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between FcγR polymorphisms and response rate or time to progression after cetuximab-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the in vitro analysis showing that the FcγRIIIa 158 V/V genotype is associated with higher ADCC, clinical data do not support a predictive role of FcγRIIIa polymorphisms in mCRC treated with cetuximab.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 8 January 2013; doi:10.1038/tpj.2012.54 </plain></SENT>
