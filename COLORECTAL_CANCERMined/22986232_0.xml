<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, several studies have recently addressed the therapeutic potential of molecularly-targeted drugs capable of inhibiting the activity of protein kinases involved in relevant signaling cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that simultaneous inhibition of the DFG-in and DFG-out conformations of p38Î± by means of type-I and type-II inhibitors is beneficial to impair more efficiently its kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that SB202190 (type-I) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> (type-II) synergize at the molecular and biological level, as co-treatment with these compounds enhances <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibition and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines and animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results support the need to reconsider <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> as a therapeutic agent against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and provide new insights that underline the importance to elucidate the activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> for the treatment of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
