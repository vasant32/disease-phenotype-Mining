<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A search of the Carcinogenic Potency Database, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) technical report database, and the published literature identified 38 and 39 chemicals reported to cause pancreatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, respectively, in mice or rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each of these chemicals, searches were conducted of the International Agency for Research on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> monographs, the NTP Report on Carcinogens, and the published literature for evidence of induction of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on this evaluation, no conclusive evidence was identified to suggest that chemicals reported to cause pancreatic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> in rodents also cause these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0009153'>pancreatic tumor</z:mp> data from mouse and rat bioassays are of limited utility with regard to predicting similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> induction in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, a lack of correlation was noted for the vast majority of chemicals </plain></SENT>
