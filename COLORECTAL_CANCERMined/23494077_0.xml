<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Over expression of tissue factor (TF) occurs in more than 50Â % of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, TF represents an attractive target antigen for immunotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here, we assessed the safety and efficacy of a recombinant adenovirus vector encoding the light chain of human coagulation factor VII (hfVII-LC) and human IgG1 Fc fragment (hIgG1-Fc), termed "benc vector," by targeting TF in the mouse model with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Benc vector was administered intravenously or intratumorally in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice with TF over-expressing HT-29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of benc vector were observed during animal experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> (5/5) was observed not only in the intravenously injection of benc vector group but also in the intratumorally of benc vector group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also observed a precautionary effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> of HT-29 cells by intratumoral injection of benc vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group of animals given empty control vector, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals (5/5) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> and exhibited a higher number of nodules after injection with HT-29 cells via the tail vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only three animals (3/5) in the treatment group receiving benc vector had any observable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> and a lower number of nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No animals died and no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was observed both in treatment groups and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, only moderate liver damage was detected in mice receiving benc vector by intravenous injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Benc vector encoding hfVII-LC and hIgG1-Fc can effectively inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice with TF over-expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and shows promise as an agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
