<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mouse model for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was induced by a combined treatment with azoxymethane (AOM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS) in BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects of aspirin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> number and size and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Key molecules of IL-6-STAT3 pathway, such as IL-6, sIL-6R, phosphorylated STAT3, and their downstream anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, were assessed by ELISA and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with aspirin significantly promoted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in AOM/DSS-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mice in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression level of IL-6, which is an upstream molecule of STAT3 and capable of activating STAT3, was reduced in aspirin-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the phosphorylated form of STAT3 and the levels of STAT3's target gene products such as Bcl-xl and Bcl-2, which are essential for cell growth and survival, were also decreased in aspirin-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that the protective mechanisms of aspirin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may be associated with its effects on induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and suppression of IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway, which implied that aspirin has a potential therapeutic activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
