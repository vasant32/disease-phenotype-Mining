<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess various surveillance protocols utilized in a tertiary referral hospital in Northern Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data concerning 373 consecutive patients who underwent radical surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between 1990 and 2006 and whose data had been entered into a prospective database were considered eligible for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall costs and the percentages of recurrence following the various surveillance protocols were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred two (27.35%) of the patients suffered a recurrence after a mean of 17.6 (95% CI 13.9-21.1) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of physical examination, colonoscopy, thorax-abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) dosage was found to be the most cost/effective one to monitor stages I and II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>; while physical examination, rigid sigmoidoscopy, thorax-abdominal CT scan, and serum CEA dosage were found to be the most cost/effective surveillance to monitor stages III and IV of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to follow-up guidelines and early detection are vital factors affecting the curability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">relapsed cancer</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who undergo surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first five years after surgery was found to be the most risky period for recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cost/effectiveness analysis indicate that follow-up protocols should be tailored to the risk of recurrence with the aim of identifying relapse when the disease is at an asymptomatic, presumably more curable stage </plain></SENT>
