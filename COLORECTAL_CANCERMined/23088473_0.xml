<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A random sample of men and women aged 50-74 years living in South Australia completed a questionnaire measuring TTM stage and attitudes toward screening using a faecal occult blood test (FOBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were categorised according to four stages of readiness to rescreen: action, maintenance, relapse and inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate techniques were used to determine predictors of lower readiness stages compared with maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 849 study participants, 29.9% were either non-adherent or had no intentions to maintain adherence (inconsistent and relapse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with maintenance rescreeners, relapse participants reported less: social influences to screen (RR=0.86, p&lt;0.001); satisfaction with prior screening (RR=0.87, p=0.03), self-efficacy (RR=0.96, p=0.01); and screening benefits (RR=0.84, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse participants were also more likely to not have private health insurance (RR=1.33, p=0.04) and be unaware of the need to repeat screening (RR=1.41, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inconsistent screeners were less likely to have planned when they will next rescreen (RR= 0.84, p=0.04) and reported greater barriers to rescreening (RR=1.05, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Action participants were younger (RR= 0.98, p=&lt;0.001), reported less social influences to screen (RR=0.94, p&lt;0.001) and were less likely to have known someone who has had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (RR=0.82, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Social cognitive, demographic and background variables significantly differentiated screening maintenance from lower readiness stages </plain></SENT>
