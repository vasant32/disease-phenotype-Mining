<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies assessing the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) patients have found an increased risk globally estimated to be 2 to 5 times higher than for the general population of the same age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The real magnitude of this risk, however, is still open to debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Research is currently being carried out on several risk and protective factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> that have recently been identified in IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A deeper understanding of these factors could help stratify patient risk and aid specialists in choosing which surveillance program is most efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are several guidelines for choosing the correct surveillance program for IBD patients; many present common characteristics with various distinctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current recommendations are far from perfect and have important limitations such as the fact that their efficiency has not been demonstrated through randomized controlled trials, the limited number of biopsies performed in daily endoscopic practice, and the difficulty in establishing the correct time to begin a given surveillance program and maintain a schedule of surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That being said, new endoscopic technologies should help by replacing random biopsy protocols with targeted biopsies in IBD patients, thereby improving the efficiency of surveillance programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing these techniques into daily endoscopic practice </plain></SENT>
