<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it has good sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> it has a poor specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wished to investigate whether distension of the colon with carbon dioxide alone would reduce the number of false-positives, but without making the test arduous or excessively uncomfortable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 134 patients were recruited and underwent MPCT colon with gas insufflation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53784">antispasmodics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with a cohort of 134 patients undergoing standard protocol MPCT colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of false-positives were compared, as was reader confidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> trial patients were given a questionnaire documenting their experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of false-positives was 15% in the control group and 5% in the trial group; this difference was statistically significant, (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reader confidence was increased in the trial group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient tolerance was good, with 95% saying they would have the test again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of gas insufflation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53784">antispasmodics</z:chebi> reduces the false-positives from 15% to 5% without adversely affecting patient tolerance </plain></SENT>
