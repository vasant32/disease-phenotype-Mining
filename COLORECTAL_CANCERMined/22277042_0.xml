<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Goal of the study was to assess their awareness of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors and their compliance with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 62 patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection and their 67 first-degree relatives (42% out of 160 addressed) answered structured questionnaire and counselling focused on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors, and screening participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> only 18% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (11/62) were aware of its risk factors, after diagnosis their awareness increased to 65% (40/62, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before questionnaire 46% of first-degree relatives (31/67) were aware of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors, after counselling awareness increased to 66% (44/67, p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>79% (53/67) offirst-degree relatives were aware of their increased familial risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>28% (19/67) of first-degree relatives enrolled for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most frequent screening method was fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in 21% (14/67) of first-degree relatives, colonoscopy was performed only in 7% (8/67) of first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average age of screening participation was 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>22% (15/67) of first-degree relatives refused any screening in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have found low awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and their relatives before their diagnosis of disease respectively before their counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>First-degree relatives are aware of their increased risk, however their screening participation is unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screening is performed only in minority of first-degree relatives, often late and with inappropriate modality (FOBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>22% of first-degree relatives refused any screening in spite of their increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
