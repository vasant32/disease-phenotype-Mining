<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The faecal occult blood test (FOBT) is the screening test validated for use in the National Health Service (NHS) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme (BCSP) after trials demonstrated a 16% reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FOBT is not validated for use outside the BCSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate the number of FOBTs performed outside of the NHS BCSP at a single centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FOBTs performed over 1 year were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basic patient demographics, requesting physician and FOBT results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Referrals and outcomes of the investigation following the FOBT were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 758 FOBTs were requested in 701 patients (352 female; median age 69; range 16-99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority (91%) were requested by general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 515 out of 758 tests (68%) were performed in patients outside the NHS BCSP age range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven out of 86 positive FOBTs were investigated, diagnosing four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> and two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine out of 87 patients with a positive FOBT were not investigated further by the requesting physician or the test repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 672 FOBTs, 615 were negative and 57 were either incomplete or unsuitable for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of 111 patients (18%) were referred to hospital and 105 of these had FOBT performed as part of the referral process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates significant misuse of the FOBT outside the NHS BCSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate use leads to false positives and exposes patients to unnecessary risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>False negatives provide reassurance to patients who may have symptoms that should be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The FOBT should not be available to physicians in either primary or secondary care and be restricted to NHS BCSP </plain></SENT>
