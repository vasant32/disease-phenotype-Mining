<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> 5 gene, DFNA5, has frequently been detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of the DFNA5 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was examined and was compared to the clinocopathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues were obtained from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent surgery at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of the DFNA5 gene in these samples was examined by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the clinicopathological findings were correlated with the methylation status of the DFNA5 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DFNA5 gene methylation was found in 29 (34%) out of the 85 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, suggesting that it was frequently observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation with methylation was observed for lymphatic vessel invasion and TNM stage (p=0.0268 and p=0.0189, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DFNA5 might act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene and DFNA5 gene methylation might play an important role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data implicate DFNA5 gene methylation as a novel molecular biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
