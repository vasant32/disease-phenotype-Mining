<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our department, we had the impression that laparoscopic surgery in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> was feasible and safe, leading to this study in which we evaluate laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and measure the impact on short-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the period from November 2004 to May 2010, 425 patients were laparoscopically operated for a colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients had a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic data and short-term outcome in patients with a BMI ≥ 30 were compared to the same data in patients with a BMI &lt; 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median operative time was significantly longer (240 vs. 225 min, p = 0.021) and the mean blood loss was significantly higher (348 vs. 285 ml, p = 0.034) in the group of patients with BMI ≥ 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No other significant differences, including conversion to open surgery and postoperative morbidity, were found between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery is feasible and safe in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with a BMI above 30, without the patients experiencing an increased risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
