<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heterocyclic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCAs</z:e>) have been hypothesized to underlie this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this prospective analysis conducted within the Multiethnic Cohort Study, we examined whether greater consumption of total, red or processed meat was associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among 165,717 participants who completed a detailed food frequency questionnaire at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined whether greater estimated intake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCAs</z:e> was associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among 131,763 participants who completed a follow-up questionnaire that included a meat-cooking module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,404 and 1,757 invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were identified from baseline to the end of follow-up and from the date of administration of the meat-cooking module to the end of follow-up, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazard models were used to estimate basic and multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with dietary exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable models, no association with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was detected for density-adjusted total meat (RR(Q5 vs. Q1) = 0.93 [0.83-1.05]), red meat (RR = 1.02 [0.91-1.16]) or processed meat intake (RR = 1.06 [0.94-1.19]) or for total (RR = 0.90 [0.76-1.05]) or specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> intake whether comparing quintiles of dietary exposure or using continuous variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although our results do not support a role for meat or for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCAs</z:e> from meat in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we cannot rule out the possibility of a modest effect </plain></SENT>
