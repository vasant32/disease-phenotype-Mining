<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: With the implementation of multimodal <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> regimens in fast-track surgery programmes, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) are being prescribed routinely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, doubts have been raised concerning the safety of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> in terms of anastomotic healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on patients who had undergone primary colorectal anastomosis at two teaching hospitals between January 2008 and December 2010 were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exact use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates of anastomotic leakage were compared between groups and corrected for known risk factors in both univariable and multivariable analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 795 patients were divided into four groups according to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use: no <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> (471 patients), use of non-selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> (201), use of selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) 2 inhibitors (79), and use of both selective and non-selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> (44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall leak rate was 9.9 per cent (10.0 per cent for right colonic, 8.7 per cent for left colonic and 12.4 per cent for rectal anastomoses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Known risk factors such as smoking and use of steroids were not significantly associated with anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stapled anastomosis was identified as an independent predictor of leakage in multivariable analysis (odds ratio (OR) 2.22, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.30 to 3.80; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> had higher anastomotic leakage rates than those not on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> (13.2 versus 7.6 per cent; OR 1.84, 1.13 to 2.98; P = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect was mainly due to non-selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> (14.5 per cent; OR 2.13, 1.24 to 3.65; P = 0.006), not selective COX-2 inhibitors (9 per cent; OR 1.16, 0.49 to 2.75; P = 0.741) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate was 4.2 per cent, with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.438) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> may be associated with anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
