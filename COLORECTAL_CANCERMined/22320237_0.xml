<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients completed questionnaires at baseline (post-surgery/pretreatment), 3 months and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires assessed <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, quality-of-life (QoL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> self-efficacy, job self-efficacy (JSE) and work ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors related to perceived work ability were occupation (β= 0.31, P= 0.0005) and QoL (β= 0.42, P= 0.01) at baseline, treatment type (β=-0.19, P= 0.05) at 3 months, and JSE at 3 months (β= 0.57, P= 0.0005) and 6 months (β= 0.50, P= 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors related to being on sick leave were lower levels of JSE (OR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.17-4.13) at baseline and being employed in a manual occupation (OR = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.00-0.86), and perceived work ability (OR = 3.05, 95% CI: 1.00-12.80) at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Along with self-assessed work ability at baseline (β= 0.67, P= 0.0005), receiving chemotherapy or a combination of treatments (β=-0.24, P= 0.05) were the strongest predictors of poorer perceptions of follow-up work ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Self-efficacy beliefs may add to understanding and should be considered in future research </plain></SENT>
