<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We sought to distinguish roles of demographic variables and bowel segments as predictors of delayed versus early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographic and anatomic variables for 66,806 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were extracted from the California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry for 2004-2008 and analyzed using logistic regression as delayed versus early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Odds ratios (OR) for binary stage categories comparing age &lt;40 (OR=2.58; 95% CI=2.26-2.94), 40-49 (1.71; 95%=1.60-1.83) and 75+ (1.05; 1.02-1.09) relative to 50-74 years were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-Hispanic whites, ORs for stage categories were: 1.05; 0.99-1.13 (non-Hispanic blacks), 1.08; 1.02-1.13 (Hispanics), and 1.05; 1.00-1.10 (Asian/others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Females had higher odds of delayed diagnosis (1.09; 1.06-1.13) than males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descending ORs were measured for successively lower to highest socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles (OR 4:5=1.08; 1.03-1.14, OR 3:5=1.13; 1.08-1.19, OR 2:5=1.18; 1.12- 1.24, and OR 1:5=1.21; 1.14-1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Younger and older than age 50-74; females; Hispanic ethnicity; bowel segment contrasts (right/left, proximal/distal, cecum plus appendix/distal), and lower SES were independent predictors of delayed diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low SES was the most robust predictor of delayed diagnosis, independent of other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Approximately 77% of delayed diagnoses were in non-Hispanic whites and Asian/others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings illustrate the value of a community SES index for targeting egalitarian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
