<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical excision of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> can reduce immune function during the postoperative period, which may affect long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that regional <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> may attenuate the immunosuppressive effect of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Opioid <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> also suppresses cell-mediated immunity, notably natural killer cell activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, using either epidural or spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> rather than systemic opioids during the postoperative period could affect long-term survival and disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospective database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> between October 2003 and December 2010 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received either an epidural, spinal block, or a <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> patient-controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) for their primary postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and disease-free survival were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 457 laparoscopic colorectal resections were performed during the period analysed; 424 cases were suitable for analysis (epidural=107, spinal=144, and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>=173) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups for age, gender, conversion rate, operation performed, TNM stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> differentiation, extramural venous, or lymphovascular invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The epidural group had significantly more <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> category III patients (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median length of stay was significantly longer in the epidural group at 5 days compared with 3 days for spinal and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in overall survival (P=0.622) or disease-free survival (P=0.490) at 5 yr between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there appears to be no significant advantage to be gained in overall or disease-free survival with the use of regional <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> compared with opioid <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> after laparoscopic colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
