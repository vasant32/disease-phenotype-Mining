<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The immunohistochemical features of fetal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> cells and their distribution patterns in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0008021'>blastomas</z:mp>, suggest that fetal haemopoiesis may take place in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These locally highly concentrated fetal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbF) cells may promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> by providing a more efficient oxygen supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Biomarkers of HbF were checked in transitional cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi>) of the urinary bladder, assessing this as a new parameter for disease management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fetal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> was immunohistochemically examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> from 60 patients with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> of the bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fetal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> erythrocytes and erythroblasts were mainly clonally distributed in proliferating blood vessels and not mixed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of such HbF blood vessels could reach more than half of the total number of vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were often many HbF erythroblasts distributed in one-cell or two-cell capillaries and present as 5-15% of cells in multi-cell vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests a local proliferation of HbF-cell progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fetal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> cells were prominently marking lower grades of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, as 76% (n=21) of the patients with G1pTa were HbF+, whereas only 6.7% (n=30) of the patients with G3pT1-pT2a were HbF+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HbF, besides being a potential new marker for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> detection, might be an essential factor of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development, as in fetal life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting HbF upregulation may provide a therapeutic target for the inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
