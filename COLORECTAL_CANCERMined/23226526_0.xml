<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> preventive properties that are largely mediated through selenoproteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous observations demonstrated that targeted down-regulation of the 15 kDa selenoprotein (Sep15) in murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells resulted in the reversal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effect of Sep15 knockout in mice using a chemically-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homozygous Sep15 knockout mice, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> littermate controls were given four weekly subcutaneous injections of azoxymethane (10 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sep15 knockout mice developed significantly (p&lt;0.001) fewer <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> than controls demonstrating that loss of Sep15 protects against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dietary <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> above adequate levels did not significantly affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> formation in Sep15 knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate molecular targets affected by loss of Sep15, gene expression patterns in colonic mucosal cells of knockout and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice were examined using microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analyses verified that guanylate binding protein-1 (GBP-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were strongly upregulated in Sep15 knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GBP-1, which is expressed in response to interferon-γ, is considered to be an activation marker during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, and up-regulation of GBP-1 in humans has been associated with a highly significant, increased five-year survival rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these studies, we observed a higher level of interferon-γ in plasma of Sep15 knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results demonstrate for the first time, that Sep15 knockout mice are protected against chemically-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> formation and that Sep15 appears to have oncogenic properties in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
