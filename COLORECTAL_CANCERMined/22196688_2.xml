<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As investigating a proteolytic target <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> originating from the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) known to be aberrantly glycosylated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), we first confirmed that TIMP1 is to be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biomarker candidate in human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this, we utilized matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry (MS) showing ultrahigh-resolution and high mass accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This investigation used phytohemagglutinin-L(4) (L-PHA) lectin, which shows binding affinity to the β-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine moiety of N-linked glycan on a protein, to compare fractionated aberrant protein glycoforms from both noncancerous control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each lectin-captured fraction containing aberrant glycoforms of TIMP1 was digested by trypsin, resulting in the tryptic target <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, representative of the serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> TIMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting target <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was enriched using a stable isotope standard and capture by the antipeptide antibody (SISCAPA) technique and analyzed by a 15 T MALDI FTICR mass spectrometer with high mass accuracy (Δ &lt; 0.5 ppm to the theoretical mass value of the target <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since exact measurement of multiplex isotopic peaks of the target <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> could be accomplished by virtue of high mass resolution (Rs &gt; 400,000), robust identification of the target <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is only achievable with 15 T FTICR MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, MALDI data obtained in this study showed that the L-PHA-captured glycoforms of TIMP1 were measured in the pooled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> serum with about 5 times higher abundance than that in the noncancerous serum, and were further proved by MRM mass analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that TIMP1 in human serum is a potent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biomarker candidate, demonstrating that ultrahigh-resolution MS can be a powerful tool toward identifying and verifying potential protein biomarker candidates </plain></SENT>
