<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isolated peritoneal recurrence may be treated by iterative procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate immediate postoperative and long-term results after iterative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>-HIPEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1990 to 2010, 30 patients with isolated peritoneal recurrence underwent iterative procedures combining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>-HIPEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Origins of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> were ovarian, colorectal, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_303'>pseudomyxoma peritonei</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100003'>peritoneal mesothelioma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo>, and primary peritoneal serous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) was 16.2 months from the first procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the second procedure, one (3.3%) postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe morbidity following the second procedure was 40% versus 30% after the first procedure (P = 0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At most recent follow up, 11 patients were disease-free, 10 were alive with recurrence, and 9 were dead with recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival after initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> with HIPEC was 65%, and overall median survival from diagnosis was 140 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Iterative procedures combining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>-HIPEC are feasible and allow long-term survival but may result in significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients must be carefully selected, based on the following criteria: Origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinomatosis</z:e>, magnitude of first procedure, length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>, physiological age, co-morbidity, and possibility of complete cytoreduction </plain></SENT>
