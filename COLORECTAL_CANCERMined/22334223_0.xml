<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Measure attractiveness of capsule colonoscopy in patients who have declined conventional colonoscopy, using patients who have undergone colonoscopy as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Internet-based survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: A total of 308 geographically diverse, high school or higher educated, middle to upper income, insured internet users who had been offered colonoscopy previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Preferences for colonoscopy, capsule colonoscopy, fecal occult blood test, or no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a description of capsule technology features relative to colonoscopy, including "no need for a ride," "no time off work," "approximately 5% less accurate," "booster preparation needed," and "follow-up colonoscopy needed in 20% of patients," preference for capsule colonoscopy was shown by 24% of those who had undergone colonoscopy and 49% of those who had not. "No need for a ride" and "no time off work" were considered positive features of capsule colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potential to undergo capsule colonoscopy during the weekend was also considered attractive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Restricted population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The availability of capsule colonoscopy could potentially increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening adherence rates among patients who decline screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
