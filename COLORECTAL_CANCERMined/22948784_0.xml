<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on a previous finding that endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) is a potential serum marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), the aim of this study was to clarify the clinicopathological significance of ESM-1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and to explore the correlation between ESM-1 and HIF-1α in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> related to hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ESM-1 mRNA expression was examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal tissues by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This experiment confirmed that ESM-1 levels were high in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened the tissue samples of 143 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, we determined that the ESM-1 immunoreactivity was significantly correlated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, depth of invasion, nodal status, distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and Dukes' stage, and was an independent prognostic factor for disease recurrence and worse survival outcome (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modulation of ESM-1 under <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was investigated, and it was confirmed that ESM-1 expression was induced by HIF1-α and significantly attenuated by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) targeting HIF-1α in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results showed that ESM-1 is significantly overexpressed, which is regulated by HIF-1α in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and can be used as a potential biomarker and a therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
