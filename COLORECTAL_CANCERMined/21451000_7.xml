<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus ( Streptococcus bovis biotype I) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> is in general low but very often linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the virulence characteristics that distinguish this opportunistic pathogen from a panel of (closely related) intestinal bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The route of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was reconstructed in vitro with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, invasion, and translocation assays on differentiated Caco-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cellular immune responses upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> biofilm formation were analyzed in a comparative manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: S. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus strains were demonstrated to have a relative low adhesiveness and could not internalize epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these bacteria were uniquely able to paracellularly cross a differentiated epithelium without inducing epithelial interleukin 8 or 1Î² responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, they had an outstanding ability to form biofilms on collagen-rich surfaces, which in vivo are found at damaged heart valves and (pre)cancerous sites with a displaced epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data show that S. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus has a unique repertoire of virulence factors that facilitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> through (pre)malignant colonic lesions and subsequently can provide this bacterium with a competitive advantage in (1) evading the innate immune system and (2) forming resistant vegetations at collagen-rich sites in susceptible patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
