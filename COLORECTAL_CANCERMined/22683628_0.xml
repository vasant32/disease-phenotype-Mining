<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While it is known that cytoplasmic retention of p53 occurs in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, the mechanisms responsible for this retention have not been positively identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since heatshock proteins like mortalin have been associated with p53 inactivation in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the current study sought to characterize this potential interaction in never before examined colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six cell lines, one with 3 different fractions, were examined to determine expression of p53 and mortalin and characterize their cellular localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of these cell lines displayed punctate p53 and mortalin localization in the cell cytoplasm with the exception of HCT-8 and HCT116 379.2 cells, where p53 was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear p53 was only observed in HCT-116 40-16, LS123, and HT-29 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortalin was only localized in the cytoplasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Co-immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry revealed that p53 and mortalin were bound and co-localized in the cytoplasmic fraction of four cell lines, HCT-116 (40-16 and 386; parental and heterozygous fractions respectively of the same cell line), HT-29, LS123 and LoVo, implying that p53 nuclear function is limited in those cell lines by being restricted to the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortalin gene expression levels were higher than gene expression levels of p53 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell lines with cytoplasmic sequestration of p53, however, also displayed elevated p53 gene expression levels compared to cell lines without p53 sequestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data reveal the characteristic cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 by the heat shock protein mortalin in human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines, as is the case for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
