<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in BER genes which modulate the DNA repair capacity may affect the susceptibility and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study and followed up the cases to explore the associations between BER genes polymorphisms and the risk and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study included 451 CRC patients and 631 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-1 (APE1), <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT, also known as PARP1), and X-ray repair cross-complementing groups 1 (XRCC1) were tested by PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), and their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARP1 762 recessive model (OR = 1.57, 95 % CI 1.12-2.20) and XRCC1 194 dominant model (OR = 1.45, 95 % CI 1.12-1.88) were associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant increasing trend for the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was detected with the increasing number of putative risk genotypes (P (trend) = 0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no association was found between these four SNPs and the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, APE1 (Asp148Glu), PARP1 (Ala762Val), and XRCC1 (Arg399Gln, Arg194Trp) were associated with the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but were not associated with the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
