<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) have identified common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to 10 independent loci that confer modest increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies have been conducted in European populations and it is unclear whether these observations generalise to populations with different ethnicities and rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An association study was performed on 892 CRC cases and 890 controls recruited from the Hong Kong Chinese population, genotyping 32 SNPs, which were either associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in previous studies or are in close proximity to previously reported risk SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve of the SNPs showed evidence of an association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest associations were provided by rs10795668 on 10p14, rs4779584 on 15q14 and rs12953717 on 18q21.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was significant linear association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk and the number of independent risk variants possessed by an individual (P=2.29 Ã— 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that some previously reported SNP associations also impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possible reasons for failure of replication for some loci include inadequate study power, differences in allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium structure or effect size between populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that many associations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are likely to generalise across populations </plain></SENT>
