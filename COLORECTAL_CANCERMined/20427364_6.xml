<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Some years ago, Spain registered a much lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) incidence and mortality rate than did other European countries but the rates have since converged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to compare time trends for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality, identify change-points in these trends and thereby update available information in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incidence data were drawn from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries in Spain which participated in the European Network of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registries and had been collecting data for at least 10 consecutive years during the period 1975-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> corresponded to codes 153, 154 and 159.0 of the International Classification of Diseases ninth revision (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9) and codes C18-C21 and C26.0 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, the 13 registries included in this study cover approximately 26% of the total Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the time trends in incidence and mortality using transition change-point and age-period-cohort models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results revealed an important increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence in Spain, which held constant across the entire study period but became slightly attenuated in both sexes around 1995, when a change-point was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual increase in incidence, which had been 4.3% per annum in men up to this point, declined to 2.5% thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, the increase in incidence, albeit also of considerable magnitude, was more moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence trend contrasted sharply with that for mortality, inasmuch as the latter changed in 1997-98, after which point mortality rates in both sexes began to decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The divergence between incidence (upward trend) and mortality rates (downward trend from the mid-1990s onwards) would suggest that possible explanations may lie in improved accessibility to endoscopy increased early detection with a corresponding shift to an earlier disease stage and improvements in therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This trend is having important consequences insofar as disease prevalence and burden of care are concerned </plain></SENT>
