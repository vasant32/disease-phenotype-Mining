<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whilst useful, these categories may not fully represent the underlying molecular subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We screened 906 stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> from the VICTOR clinical trial for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses (logistic regression, clustering, Bayesian networks) identified the primary molecular associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive associations occurred between: CIN and TP53 mutation; MSI and BRAF mutation; and KRAS and PIK3CA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Negative associations occurred between: MSI and CIN; MSI and NRAS mutation; and KRAS mutation, and each of NRAS, TP53 and BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some complex relationships were elucidated: KRAS and TP53 mutations had both a direct negative association and a weaker, confounding, positive association via TP53-CIN-MSI-BRAF-KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested a new molecular classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>: (1) MSI(+) and/or BRAF-mutant; (2) CIN(+) and/or TP53(-) mutant, with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS and PIK3CA; (3) KRAS- and/or PIK3CA-mutant, CIN(+) , TP53-<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>; (4) KRAS(-) and/or PIK3CA-mutant, CIN(-) , TP53-<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>; (5) NRAS-mutant; (6) no mutations; (7) others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As expected, group 1 cancers were mostly proximal and poorly differentiated, usually occurring in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, two different types of CIN(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were found: group 2 cancers were usually distal and occurred in men, whereas group 3 showed neither of these associations but were of higher stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CIN(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> have conventionally been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of these variables, because they have been tested en masse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our classification also showed potentially improved prognostic capabilities, with group 3, and possibly group 1, independently predicting disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
