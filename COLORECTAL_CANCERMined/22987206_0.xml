<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The typical FAP is characterized by hundreds to thousands of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and by extracolonic manifestations, later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and lower number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in colon is characteristic of an attenuated form (AFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the APC gene for germline mutations in 90 FAP/AFAP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening was performed using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA fragments showing an aberrant electrophoretic banding pattern were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APC-mutation-negative probands were screened for large deletions of the APC gene using multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> variants followed in probands with possible splicing mutation by PCR amplification of target site flanking exons and sequencing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and aberrant products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified 30 germline variants among 36 unrelated probands including large deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven APC variants detected last two years have not been reported yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, fifteen of them are expected to cause errors in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in ten of these patients revealed exon skipping in seven cases, exonisation of intron in one of these as well, change of the amount of alternatively spliced product in one case, and no effect was found in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In two of the patients, the biopsy of colon mucosa and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> enabled us to examine the effect of the mutation on splicing pattern in colon cells directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The comparison of alternative and standard transcript amount showed similar transcription pattern of exon 14 in control colon mucosa tissue (9 samples) as in 51 blood control samples </plain></SENT>
