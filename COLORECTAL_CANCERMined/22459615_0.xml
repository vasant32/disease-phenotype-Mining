<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the evidence for such a relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two investigators independently searched the Medline and Embase Databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CYP1B1 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were calculated in a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pooled ORs were performed for co-dominant model (GG vs AA, GA vs AA), dominant model (GG+GA vs AA), and recessive model (GG vs GA+AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis included 7 case-control studies, which included 6375 CRC cases and 7003 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the variant genotypes (GG and GA) of the 453 A/G were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk when compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> AA homozygote (GG vs AA, OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.77-1.14; GA vs AA, OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.87-1.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no associations were found in the dominant and recessive models (dominant model, OR=0.98, 95% CI=0.87-1.09; recessive model, OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.77-1.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When stratifying for country, study sample size, matched control and source of controls, no evidence of significant association was observed in any subgroup, except among those studies from "Canada" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No publication bias was found in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No association was found between the CYP1B1 Asn453Ser polymorphism and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
