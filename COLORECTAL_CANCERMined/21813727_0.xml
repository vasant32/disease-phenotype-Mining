<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Physician recommendation is one of the most important determinants of obtaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening; however, little is known about the degree to which <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussions include information that patients report as important to guide screening decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines and compares both patient rated importance and physician communication of key information elements about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening during annual physical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Design: Cross-sectional cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Setting: 26 ambulatory clinics of an integrated delivery system in the Midwest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants: 64 primary care physicians and 415 patients aged 50 to 80 due for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients completed a previsit survey to assess importance of specific information when making a preventive screening decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visits were audio recorded to assess the content of screening discussions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most patients rated test accuracy (85%), testing alternatives (83%), the pros and cons of testing (86%), and the testing process (78%) very important when making preventive screening decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one percent of visits included a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussion; however, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening talk rarely included information that patients rated as important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physicians infrequently asked whether patients had questions pertaining to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (5%); however, 49% of patients asked a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening question, with the vast majority pertaining to screening logistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Audio recordings confirm that discussions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening are often lacking information that patients indicate is very important when making preventive health decisions and patient questions during the visit are not eliciting information to fill the gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: These findings provide actionable information to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussions </plain></SENT>
