<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the effects of radiation on malignant processes have yet to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the biological effects of radiation on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells with special reference to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key developmental program often activated during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of radiation on two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines, CaR1 and DLD1, assessing cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, motility, migration and invasive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of molecules associated with EMT was determined using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining in control and irradiated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also used real-time RT-PCR to examine the expression of molecules associated with EMT before and after chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we studied 26 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined the relationship between disease recurrence and the expression of a number of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Irradiation caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells to undergo phenotypic changes characteristic of EMT: spindle-cell shape, loss of polarity, intercellular separation and pseudopodia formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Irradiation enhanced cell migration and invasiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In irradiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, molecular changes consistent with EMT were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In clinical samples, we observed molecular changes consistent with EMT, and those changes were significantly enhanced in patients with recurring disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that irradiation induces an alteration to a malignant phenotype consistent with EMT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
