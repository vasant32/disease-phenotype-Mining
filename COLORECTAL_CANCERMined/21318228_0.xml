<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 80 patients with stage III/Dukes' C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were divided into 16 patients who developed recurrence/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (recurrence group) and 64 patients without recurrence (non-recurrence group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="43" ids="29811">ONCs</z:chebi> were compared between the two groups with respect to i) single cells (â‰¥ 3 floating <z:chebi fb="43" ids="29811">ONCs</z:chebi>), ii) clusters of cells (1 or more floating aggregates of 2-20 ONCs) and iii) single cells + clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When single cells were detected, the sensitivity for recurrence was 87.5% (14/16, p = 0.002), the positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) was 32.6% (14/43), the specificity was 54.7% (35/64) and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 94.6% (35/37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For clusters, the sensitivity was 87.5% (14/16, p&lt;0.001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> was 41.2% (14/34), specificity was 68.8% (44/64) and NPV 95.7% (44/46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With single cells + clusters, the values were 87.5% (14/16, p&lt;0.001), 48.3% (14/29), 76.6% (49/64) and 96.1% (49/51), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the detection of single cells + clusters is a sensitive indicator of a high risk of recurrence/ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, while <z:chebi fb="43" ids="29811">ONCs</z:chebi> are useful for identifying the low-risk group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
