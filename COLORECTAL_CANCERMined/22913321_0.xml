<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between patient-reported experience with service quality and survival in 702 returning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated at our institution between July 2007 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall patient experience "considering everything, how satisfied are you with your overall experience?" was measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from completely dissatisfied to completely satisfied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was dichotomized into two categories: top box response (7) versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others (1-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between patient experience and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 702 patients, 506 were "completely satisfied" while 196 were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, "completely satisfied" patients had a significantly lower risk of mortality compared to those "not completely satisfied" (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61-0.98; p = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, on multivariate analysis controlling for stage at diagnosis, treatment history, age, and gender, "completely satisfied" patients demonstrated significantly lower mortality (HR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.95; p = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient experience with service quality was an independent predictor of survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, a novel finding in the literature </plain></SENT>
