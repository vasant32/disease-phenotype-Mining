<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 200 patients who underwent curative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NLR and PLR were positively correlated (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the NLR and PLR were shown to be good prognostic biomarkers of overall survival (OS) (p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PLR was an independent prognostic factor of OS based on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.971; 95% confidence interval, 1.102-3.335; p=0.021) </plain></SENT>
