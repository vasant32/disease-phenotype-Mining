<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To facilitate evaluation of such programs, we defined a set of universally applicable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening measures and indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the feasibility of data collection, we requested data on these variables and basic program characteristics from 26 organized full programs and 9 pilot programs in 24 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size of the target population for each program varied considerably from a few thousand to 36 million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of programs used fecal occult blood tests for primary screening, with more using guaiac than immunochemical tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was wide variation in the ability of screening programs to report the requested measures and in the values reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, pilot programs were more likely to provide screening measure values than were full programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, detection rates for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were substantially higher in programs screening with endoscopy than in those using fecal occult blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that the screening measures and indicators, once revised in the light of this survey, will be adopted and used by existing programs and those in the early planning stages, allowing international comparison with the goal of improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening quality </plain></SENT>
