<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease carries a cumulative risk of need of colectomy of 20-30% and an estimated cumulative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> of 18% after 30 years of disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the introduction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha inhibitors for the treatment of UC, it has become increasingly evident that the disease course is influenced by whether or not the patient achieves mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with mucosal healing have fewer flare-ups, a decreased risk of colectomy, and a lower probability of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Understanding the mechanisms of mucosal wound formation and wound healing in UC, and how they are affected therapeutically is therefore of importance for obtaining efficient treatment strategies holding the potential of changing the disease course of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review is focused on the pathophysiological mechanism of mucosal wound formation in UC as well as the known mechanisms of intestinal wound healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the latter topic, pathways of both wound healing intrinsic to epithelial cells and the wound-healing mechanisms involving interaction between epithelial cells and other cells of the mucosa are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biochemistry of wound healing in UC provides the basis for the subsequent description of how these pathways are affected by the current medications, and what can be learnt on how to design future treatment regimens for UC based on targeting mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
