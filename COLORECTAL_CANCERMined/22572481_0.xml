<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Under the French organised screening programme, 85,149 average-risk individuals aged 50-74 participating in the third screening round, performed both the G-FOBT (Hemoccult-II test) and one of the I-FOBTs: FOB-Gold, Magstream and OC-Sensor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Given the chosen threshold, the positivity ratio between the different I-FOBTs and the G-FOBT was 2.4 for FOB-Gold, 2.0 for Magstream and 2.2 for OC-Sensor (P=0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three I-FOBTs were superior to the G-FOBT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratios for detection rates were 1.6 (FOB-Gold), 1.7 (Magstream) and 2.1 (OC-Sensor) (P=0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For non-invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> they were, respectively, 2.5, 3.0 and 4.0 (P=0.83) and for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> 3.6, 3.1 and 4.0 (P=0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that I-FOBT is superior to G-FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the three I-FOBTs studied appeared to be significantly better than the others </plain></SENT>
