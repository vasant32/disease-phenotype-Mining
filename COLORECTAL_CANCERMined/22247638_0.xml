<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study series included 34 patients with malignant colorectal obstruction who underwent implantation of a 20-mm dual-design expandable colorectal stent in our department between March 2009 and June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 20-mm dual-design expandable colorectal stent was placed by using a 3.8-mm delivery system that had 28-mm diameter proximal and distal ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 34 patients, stent placement for palliation was performed in 20 patients, while stent placement for bridge to surgery was performed in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 97% (33 of 34) success rate was achieved for the stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate in the bridge to surgery group was 7% (1 of 14), compared to 0% (0 of 19) in palliative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Migration occurred in one of 33 patients (3%) at 30 days after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The placement of a 20-mm diameter dual-design stent appears to be clinically safe and effective for the management of colorectal obstruction, with low <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and migration rates </plain></SENT>
