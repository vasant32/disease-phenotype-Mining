<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survival of patients with IBD-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was reviewed to analyse differences between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We analysed (24 men and 10 women) patients with CD (n = 14) or UC (n = 20) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, who presented between 1990 and 2007, and were followed to October, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 56 ± 12 years for patients with UC and 49 ± 17 years for patients with CD, and the mean duration of symptoms was 22 ± 11 and 16 ± 8 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration of follow up after the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 49 (1-157) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrence occurred in five patients with UC and in nine with CD (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall and disease free five year survivals were significantly higher in patients with UC than CD [70%vs 43% (P = 0.01) and 63%vs 31% (P = 0.01), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results showed a poorer prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with CD than with UC </plain></SENT>
