<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> than whites and have shorter survival once they are diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, the authors examined racial differences in clinical outcomes among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) who received bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 1589 white patients (81.4%) and 227 African American patients (11.6%) with mCRC who received front-line bevacizumab therapy and who were enrolled in a large, predominantly community-based, prospective, observational cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in time-to-event endpoints and response rates were examined by race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in the incidence of baseline and treatment-related toxicities associated with bevacizumab also were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, differences in patterns of care by race were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median overall survival was 22.6 months for African Americans and 22.9 months for whites, and the median progression-free survival was 9.5 months for African Americans and 9.8 months for whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rates (complete responses plus partial responses) were 37.5% for African Americans and 46.3% for whites (adjusted odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>African Americans had higher rates of baseline <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (18.9% vs 11%; P = .002), higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (52.9% vs 41.4%; P = .001), and worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> while on therapy (13.7% vs 8.9%; P = .02), but no differences in on-treatment arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This large observational cohort study of patients with mCRC demonstrated that, when treated in a similar fashion with modern chemotherapy, African Americans and whites had equivalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in bevacizumab-related toxicity or patterns of care were observed between African Americans and whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lower response rate among African Americans deserves further study </plain></SENT>
