<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Team-based reflection may be an important element for understanding QI implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extensive research has focused on individual benefits of reflection including links between reflection, learning, and change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are currently no published studies that explore how team-based reflection impact QI interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected 4 primary care practices participating in a QI trial that used a facilitated, team-based approach to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trained facilitators met with a team of practice members for up to eleven 1-hour meetings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data include audio-recorded team meetings and associated fieldnotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We used a template approach to code transcribed data and an immersion/crystallization technique to identify patterns and themes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three types of team-based reflection and how each mattered for QI implementation were identified: organizational reflection promoted buy-in, motivation, and feelings of inspiration; process reflection enhanced team problem solving and change management; and relational reflection enhanced discussions of relational dynamics necessary to implement desired QI changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If QI interventions seek to make changes where collaboration and coordination of care is required, then deliberately integrating team-based reflection into interventions can provide opportunities to facilitate change processes </plain></SENT>
