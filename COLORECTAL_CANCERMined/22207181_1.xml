<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation has been proposed as an alternative mechanism to inactivate genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the methylation silencing of the WNT pathway during colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, we examined the aberrant methylation profile of four genes, APC, Axin1, Axin2, and GSK3β in an unselected series of 112 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> by methylation specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the Axin2 C148T SNP is associated with the risk of developing certain types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the contribution of Axin2 SNP to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility, we examined the Axin2 C148T genotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and 170 healthy controls by PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> with at least one gene methylated was 18.75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation of Axin2 and APC genes was detected in 7.1 and 11.9% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No aberrant methylation was found in Gsk3β and Axin1 gene in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of APC had no significant association with clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But, promoter methylation of Axin2 was sex-related, occurring more frequently in females (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of Axin2 C148T genotypes were similar in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed no association between the Axin2 SNP and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients stratified by age, sex, and smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the heterozygote CT genotype was associated with a reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in distal patients compared with proximal patients (OR = 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.9, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that Axin1 and GSK3β methylation play a minor role in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
