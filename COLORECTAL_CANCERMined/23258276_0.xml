<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Skepticism exists with respect to their effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review presents the potential clinical applications of pro-/pre-/synbiotics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search of electronic databases was conducted and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies published on 'probiotics', 'prebiotics' and 'synbiotics' were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, the ones referring to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and which had any clinical relevance offering information on perioperative parameters were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incorporation of pre-/<z:chebi fb="180" ids="32871">pro-</z:chebi>/synbiotic formulations in the preoperative mechanical bowel preparation cannot be supported by the current evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limited clinical studies may be promising in supporting their potentially protective role against postoperative infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Encouraging are the results on their protective role against adjuvant (chemo)radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such supplementation may also hold promise to improve postcolectomy gastrointestinal related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the positive results and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of agents, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> combinations and concentrations, the inconsistency in administration, the inhomogeneity of comparison groups and lack of stringent clinical endpoints remain obstacles in the effort to establish a definitive clinical strategy at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further work is warranted to gain a keen understanding of their clinical value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
