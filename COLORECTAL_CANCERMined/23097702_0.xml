<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mainstay of therapy for advanced disease remains the cytotoxic chemotherapy including 5-FU, irinotecan, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The USFDA approval and introduction of targeted therapies, including cetuximab and panitumumab (monoclonal antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) and bevacizumab (monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF)), has improved the median survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> to around 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clearly, better and more efficacious drugs are needed, and target-specific agents remain the future of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On this front, rapid advances are being made, which are likely to change the future of the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, absence of specific biomarkers for the use of targeted agents, in the subset of population who will benefit from the treatment, remains a major drawback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review agents that are in phases 1 and 2 clinical development, specifically targeting the EGFR and its subsequent downstream pathways </plain></SENT>
