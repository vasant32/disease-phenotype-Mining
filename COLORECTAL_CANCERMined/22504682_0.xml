<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 23 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> experiencing grade 1-3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> during treatment with chemotherapy (2- or 3-week per cycle) entered the current study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their average age was 67 years, ranging from 44 to 84 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 22 patients received the same chemotherapy regimen, but also received more than 80 g of Elental (ED) (including 1, 932 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18050,30011">L-glutamine</z:chebi>), per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FOLFOX, FOLFIRI or XELOX-based chemotherapy was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A dose reduction of 5-FU, capacitabine or S-1 was performed in 5 patients who experienced grade 2 or 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> decreased in 18 of the 22 patients after the first treatment course, and decreased in 20 of 22 patients after the second course with ED.The preventive efficacy of ED on <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> was noted in a dose-dependent manner.Similarly, the maximum grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> decreased in 10 of 11 patients after their first or second treatment course with ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that ED can significantly decrease the severity of chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in association with the control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
