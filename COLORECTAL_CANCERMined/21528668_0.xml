<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Adequate lymph node evaluation is an important determinant of prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current guidelines recommend evaluation of at least 12 lymph nodes; however, a significant number of patients fail to meet these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the factors that influence adequate recovery and evaluation of lymph nodes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 454 consecutive cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgically treated from September 2000 to September 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression analysis was used to study the effect of various factors in lymph node recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of lymph nodes retrieved ranged from 0 to 62 with a median of 13 nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 189 (41.6%) patients had fewer than 12 nodes removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, location and size were associated with lymph node retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression revealed that the aforementioned variables, including gender and hospital type, explained 17% of the observed variance of the lymph node number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics, although important, are only partly responsible for the variation of lymph node yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quality of surgical resection and/or the thoroughness of examination of the tissue by the pathologist might explain the wider proportion of this variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Training in colorectal node evaluation could help to improve the quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
