<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Pfannenstiel incision, widely used in gynecological surgery, has been reported to be associated with lower rates of wound complications than midline incisions in open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its effect on wound complications in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that use of a Pfannenstiel incision in MIS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections would be associated with fewer short-term wound complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed on 171 patients who had undergone MIS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery requiring a specimen extraction/hand-access site, divided into a Pfannenstiel and a midline group depending on the type of incision used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wound complications compared included disruption, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, dehiscence, evisceration, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests were used to analyze differences in risk factors between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with prevention of wound complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the Pfannenstiel group had significantly lower rates of wound disruption (0 vs. 13%, p = 0.02), superficial surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (7 vs. 22%, p = 0.03), and overall wound complications (13 vs. 30%, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate logistic regression, Pfannenstiel incisions and colon rather than rectal resections were significant predictors of prevention of wound complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of a Pfannenstiel incision in MIS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections is associated with a decreased risk of short-term wound complications </plain></SENT>
