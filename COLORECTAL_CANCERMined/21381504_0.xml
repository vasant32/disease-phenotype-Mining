<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TF-antigen (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1406916" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thomsen</z:e>-Friedenreich) can be identified by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> oxidase-Schiff's (GOS) reaction either on tissues or on rectal mucus samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TF antigen is expressed in the neoplastic mucosa and not expressed in colonic mucosa of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apomucins play important role in cell signalling and their specific pattern of expression during the different steps of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> toward <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> suggests that they play significant roles in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The family of secreted mucins including MUC2 is contributing in mucus formation to protect underlying epithelia against diverse injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current study was investigated the expression of MUC2 and TF antigens in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: MUC2 and TF antigen expressions were detected immunohistochemically in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biopsies using specific monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the TF antigen was invesigated using GOS reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic specimens, MUC2 expression was detected in 20%, while TF antigen was completely negative in 100% of samples as detected by GOS and immunohistochemistry using anti-TF monoclone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expressions of MUC2, and TF antigen as detected by GOS and anti-TF monoclone were positive in 96%, 80%, and 60% respectively in cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the expression of MUC2 was seen in 92% of cases, while TF antigen was observed in 84% and 60% of cases as detected by GOS and immunohistochemically respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus, it is concluded that the expression of MUC2 and TF antigens are altered during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MUC2 and TF antigens may have a diagnostic and or prognostic potential in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
