<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the surgical distal resection margin from a histopathological viewpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 629 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type of distal spread was evaluated, and the maximum length of distal spread was measured using a micrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of discontinuous spread type were 1.0%, 8.4%, 52.9%, and 81.5%, and the average lengths of distal spread were .5 ± 1.3 mm, 7 ± 1.8 mm, 2.7 ± 2.4 mm, and 10.0 ± 9.5 mm for well-differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, moderately differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, solid (por1)-type poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and nonsolid (por2)-type poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, (moderately vs solid [por1] type: P = .004), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The surgical distal resection margin based on pathological diagnosis is longer somewhat than that based on macroscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to select surgical procedures with great care to ensure an adequate surgical distal resection margin </plain></SENT>
