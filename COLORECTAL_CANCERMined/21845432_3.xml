<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test our hypothesis that dysregulation of innate immune responses acts to trigger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, we studied the expression of TLR2 and 4 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In specimens of cancerous and noncancerous colorectal tissue obtained at surgery, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of TLR2 and 4 were quantified by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction and compared between the two types of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To confirm TLR2 and TLR4 protein expression levels, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using the same samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TLR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly higher in cancerous tissue than in noncancerous tissue, while TLR4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed stronger staining for TLR2 in cancerous mucosal epithelial cells than in noncancerous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staining for TLR4 in the lamina propria of the mucosa was equally weakly positive in noncancerous tissue and cancerous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This TLR-specific difference in expression suggested that such expression does not only reflect a local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> infiltration, i.e., if this was the case, both TLR2 and 4 expression would probably be up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that TLR2 expression might be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, whereas TLR4 is not </plain></SENT>
