<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, clinical trial data are currently limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized, phase II chemoprevention trial involving subjects 40 years or older, with previously resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> or multiple/advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnification chromoendoscopy (MCE) was performed to identify and characterize rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF); eligibility criteria required five or more rectal ACFs at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention assignments were as follows: (a) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg qd; (b) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> 150 mg bid; (c) oligofructose-enriched <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15443">inulin</z:chebi> (as ORAFTI®Synergy1) 6 gm bid; or (d) control (maltodextrin) 6 gm bid, for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percent change in rectal ACF number (%ΔACF) within arm was the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included changes in proliferation (Ki67) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (caspase-3), as measured from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 85 eligible randomized subjects, 76 (86%) completed the trial per protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median (range) of rectal ACF was 9 (5-34) and 8 (0-37) at baseline and postintervention, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median (SD) for %ΔACF was 5.6 (-69% to 143%), -18.6 (-83% to 160%), -3.6 (-88% to 83%), and -10.0 (-100% to 117%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi>, ORAFTI®Synergy1 and control arms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither within-arm (P = 0.12-0.59) nor between-arm (P = 0.30-0.92) comparisons of %ΔACF were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The active and control interventions also seemed to have similar effects on mucosal proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (P &gt; 0.05 for each comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Data from this multicenter, phase II trial do not provide convincing evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk reduction from 6-month interventions with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi>, or ORAFTI®Synergy1, although statistical power was limited by the relatively small sample size </plain></SENT>
