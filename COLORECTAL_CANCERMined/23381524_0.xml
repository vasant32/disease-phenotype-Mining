<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the proven efficacy of decision <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> as interventions for increasing patient engagement and facilitating shared decision making, they are not used routinely in clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings from a project designed to achieve such integration, conducted at five primary care practices in 2010-12, document low rates of distribution of decision <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> to eligible patients due for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (9.3 percent) and experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> (10.7 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were also no lasting increases in distribution rates in response to training sessions and other promotional activities for physicians and clinic staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of focus groups, ethnographic field notes, and surveys suggest that major structural and cultural changes in health care practice and policy are necessary to achieve the levels of use of decision <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> and shared decision making in routine practice envisioned in current policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these changes are ongoing incentives for use, physician training, and a team-based practice model in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> care team members bear formal responsibility for the use of decision <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> in routine primary care </plain></SENT>
