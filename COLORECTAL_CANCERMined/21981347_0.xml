<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The question of continuing screening in this group has not been addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data on participants aged 50-69 years with a positive gFOBT result and a negative colonoscopy were followed through the biennial screening pilot conducted between 2000 and 2007 in Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first screening round, 1527 colonoscopies were negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1300 were re-invited in the second round, 905 accepted, and 157 had a positive gFOBT result, giving a positivity rate of 17.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy revealed 20 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and six with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the third screening round 1031 were invited for a third time and 730 accepted: 55 had a positive gFOBT test, giving a positivity rate of 7.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this group, six colonoscopies revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> but there were no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the third screening round, 108 individuals had had two positive gFOBT results and two subsequent negative colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four were invited for a third gFOBT, 66 accepted and 19 (25.6%) had a positive result none of whom had an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that a negative colonoscopy following a positive gFOBT is not a contraindication for further screening, although this is likely to have a low yield of neoplastic pathology after two negative colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
