<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: New hemostatic technologies are often employed in open and laparoscopic surgery to reduce duration of surgery and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monopolar diathermy, Harmonic scalpel and LigaSure are routinely used in open and laparoscopic surgery for tissue cutting and hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared lateral thermal damage following in vivo application of 3 commonly used instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used monopolar diathermy, Harmonic scalpel and LigaSure to coagulate and divide the peritoneum of patients who underwent median laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After anesthesia, median supraumbilical laparotomy was performed, and the peritoneum of each patient was coagulated using different devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using light microscopy and morphometric imaging analysis, the width of tissue lateral thermal damage was measured from the point of the peritoneal incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 100 patients in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a peritoneal incision, the mean lateral thermal damage of monopolar diathermy, Harmonic scalpel (output power 3), Harmonic scalpel (output power 5) and LigaSure were 215.79 μm, 90.42 μm, 127.48 μm and 144.18 μm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The degree of lateral thermal spread varied by instrument type, power setting and application time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LigaSure and Harmonic scalpel were the safest and most efficient methods of tissue coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Monopolar diathermy resulted in the greatest degree of thermal damage in tissues </plain></SENT>
