<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As CanCORS results will inform national policy, it is important to know how they generalize to the United States population with these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN: This study assessed the representativeness of the CanCORS cohort of 10,547 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (LC) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) enrolled between 2003 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared characteristics (sex, race, age, and disease stage) with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population of 234,464 patients with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> during the CanCORS recruitment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CanCORS sample is well matched to the SEER Program for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CanCORS, 41% LC/47% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were female versus 47% LC/49% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in SEER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>African American, Hispanic, and Asian cases differed by no more than 5 percentage points between CanCORS and SEER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SEER population is slightly older, with the percentage of patients older than 75 years 33.1% LC/37.3% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in SEER versus 26.9% LC/29.4% in CanCORS, and also has a slightly higher proportion of early stage patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found that the CanCORS cohort was representative within specific SEER regions that map closely to CanCORS sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the CanCORS Consortium was successful in enrolling a demographically representative sample within the CanCORS regions </plain></SENT>
