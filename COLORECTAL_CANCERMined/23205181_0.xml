<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) represents a naturally occurring competitive inhibitor of RAGE-mediated events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a colonoscopy-based case-control study, we examined the associations of plasma levels of sRAGE, sTNF-αRI, sTNF-αRII, sIL-6R, EGF, IFNα2, G-CSF, MCP1, TNFβ, and VEGF with risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively identified 158 cases with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 203 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-free controls who were frequency-matched according to age, sex, race, and time of blood draw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure information was collected using a questionnaire and fasting plasma samples were obtained before the colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used Luminex bead-based multiplex assays to determine level of biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases had insignificant lower levels of sRAGE, and higher levels of EGF and VEGF than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the highest compared with the lowest category, the OR (95% CI) of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was 0.55 (0.31-0.96) (P trend = 0.03) for sRAGE and 1.75 (1.05-2.93) (P trend =0.04) for VEGF, adjusting for age, smoking status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inverse association between sRAGE and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was seen only among those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P interaction = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An inverse association between sRAGE and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was in line with an inverse association between sRAGE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> previously reported </plain></SENT>
