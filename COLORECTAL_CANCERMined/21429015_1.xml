<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several previous studies have identified narrow-band imaging (NBI) with magnification as being useful in evaluating early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> invasion depth, but comparative diagnostic accuracy of invasion depth between pit pattern analysis using magnifying chromoendoscopy and NBI remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to compare NBI and pit pattern analysis using magnifying chromoendoscopy in estimating early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> invasion depth and to assess interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a total of 72 early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> in 72 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each lesion image was subsequently reviewed by two experienced colonoscopists (A, B) and then classified clinically based on invasive/non-invasive pattern and Sano's capillary pattern classification with a five-point scale of confidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In terms of diagnostic accuracy with confidence for A and B, the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve were 0.84 and 0.81 for pit pattern analysis and 0.82 and 0.79 for NBI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of submucosal deep (&gt;1000 µm) invasion was evaluated for both modalities and indicated substantial agreement with pit pattern analysis (κ = 0.63) and moderate agreement with NBI (κ = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  Estimating invasion depth of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using NBI appeared to have been comparable to pit pattern analysis, but there was greater interobserver variability using NBI </plain></SENT>
