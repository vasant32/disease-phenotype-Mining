<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In this paper we investigate the reasons for non-participation in a trial programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening in Flanders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides, the feasibility and possibilities of a full-blown screening programme in Flanders are examined, given the context of a low participation rate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A trial programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was set up for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> average-risk persons aged 50 to 74 years in three Flemish regions to obtain information about potential participation rates, and to compare two invitation strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Faecal samples were analysed for precursors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was administered to participants and non-participants of the trial programme to find out whether and to what extent the taking of a sample of one's own stool is a taboo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This could be of great importance concerning the participation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 19,542 persons were invited to participate in the trial programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, of whom 18,541 were found to be eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall participation rate was 44.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three regions varied in participation rates: with 60.9% in the most rural region to 34.3% in the most urban region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 2,000 questionnaires sent to participants, 1,385 were returned (69.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The response in the non-participants was 43.2%i (691 questionnaires of 1,600 returned) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A population-based screening programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by means of an iFOBT proves to be feasible, since adequate participation rates were obtained and because of the absence of a 'stool taboo' in Flanders </plain></SENT>
