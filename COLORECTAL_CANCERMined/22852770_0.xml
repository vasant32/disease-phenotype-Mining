<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Records kept as a result of the implementation of Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) constitute a public inventory of industries, created by the European Commission, which is a valuable resource for monitoring industrial pollution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to ascertain whether there might be excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality among populations residing in the vicinity of Spanish industrial installations that are governed by the IPPC Directive and E-PRTR Regulation and report their emissions to air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An ecological study was designed to examine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality at a municipal level (8098 Spanish towns), over the period 1997-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted an exploratory "near vs. far" analysis to estimate the relative risks (RR) of towns situated at a distance of less than 2 km from industrial installations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis was repeated for each of the 24 industrial groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RR and their 95% credible/confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated on the basis of Poisson regression models, using two types of modelling: a) the conditional autoregressive Bayesian model proposed by Besag, York and Molli√©, with explanatory variables; and b) a mixed regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Integrated nested Laplace approximations were used as a Bayesian inference tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant RRs were detected in the vicinity of mining industry (RR 1.258; 95%CI 1.082 - 1.463), paper and wood production (RR 1.071; 95%CI 1.007 - 1.140), food and beverage sector (RR 1.069; 95%CI 1.029 - 1.111), metal production and processing installations (RR 1.065; 95% CI 1.011 - 1.123) and ceramics (RR 1.050 ; 95%CI 1.004 - 1.099) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given the exploratory nature of this study, it would seem advisable to check in other countries or with other designs, if the proximity of industries that emit pollutants into the air could be an added risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, some of the differences between men and women observed in the analyses of the industrial groups suggest that there may be a component of occupational exposure, little-studied in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751075" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the digestive system</z:e> </plain></SENT>
