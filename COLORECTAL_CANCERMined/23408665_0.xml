<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four hormones synthesized in the heart, namely vessel dilator, atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP), kaliuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (KP) and long-acting natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (LANP), have anticancer effects both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These heart hormones were evaluated for their ability to inhibit sFRP-3, which is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasiveness, in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and renal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vessel dilator, KP, ANP and LANP maximally reduced the concentration of sFRP-3 by 83%, 83%, 84% and 83%, respectively (each at P&lt;0.0001), in the human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the human pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells, the concentration of sFRP-3 was maximally reduced by 77%, 77%, 77% and 78% (each at P&lt;0.0001) secondary to treatment with vessel dilator, KP, ANP and LANP, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the human renal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells, the sFRP-3 was maximally reduced by vessel dilator, KP, ANP and LANP by 68%, 66%, 68% and 66% (each at P&lt;0.0001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that these four cardiac hormones are significant inhibitors (up to 84%) of sFRP-3 in a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these data suggest that the metabolic targeting of sFRP-3 by the cardiac hormones contributes to their anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mechanism(s) of action </plain></SENT>
