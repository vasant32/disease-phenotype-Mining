<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that timing and type of IPV as well as childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282350" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual abuse</z:e> (CSA) may negatively affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, perceived stress, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of women diagnosed with either breast, cervical, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the prior 12 months included in the Kentucky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consenting women were interviewed by phone (n=553) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to determine the association between IPV (37% lifetime prevalence) and type, timing, and the range of correlated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related well-being indicators, adjusting for confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IPV (p=0.002) and CSA (p=0.03) were associated with the six correlated well-being indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, lifetime and current IPV were associated with lower Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast Cancer</z:hpo> (FACT-B) (p=0.006) and Functional Assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-being Scale (FACIT-SP) (p=0.03) scores, higher perceived stress at diagnosis (p=0.006), and depressive symptom scores at diagnosis (p&lt;0.0001), whereas CSA was associated with lower FACT-B (p=0.02), increased number of comorbid conditions (p=0.03), and higher current stress levels (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current and past IPV, as well as psychologic abuse, were associated with poorer well-being among women with a recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that both IPV and CSA negatively influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related well-being indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that identification of lifetime IPV and other stressors may provide information that healthcare providers can use to best support and potentially improve the well-being of female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
