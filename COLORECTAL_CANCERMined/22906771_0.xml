<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential mediating effect of MD on the association between the aforementioned factor (smoking) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: It is a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (63 Â± 12 years, 59% males) and 250 age-sex group-matched controls, both from the area of Attica, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle (including detailed smoking habits) and dietary characteristics were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adherence to the MD was evaluated using the MedDietScore (theoretical range 0-55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each unit increase in the MedDietScore was associated with 13% lower likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smoking habits were associated with 2.9-fold the likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among participants who were away from the MD (i.e. MedDietScore &lt; 29) and with 2.1-fold the likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among those who were close to the MD (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the MD was associated with a less detrimental association of smoking habits with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, suggesting indirect benefits of adherence to this dietary pattern with regards to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
