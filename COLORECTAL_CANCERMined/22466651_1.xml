<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> colonic epithelia express a truncated TCF-1 form, called dnTCF-1, that lacks the critical β-catenin-binding domain and behaves as a transcriptional suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>How the cell maintains a balance between the two forms of TCF-1 is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) modulates the interaction between β-catenin and TCF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed EBP50 localization to the nucleus of human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines at low cell culture densities and human primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> that manifested a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EBP50 was primarily membranous in confluent cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aberrantly located EBP50 stabilized conventional β-catenin/TCF-1 complexes and connected β-catenin to dnTCF-1 to form a ternary molecular complex that enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling events, including the transcription of downstream oncogenes such as c-Myc and cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide analysis of the EBP50 occupancy pattern revealed consensus binding motifs bearing similarity to Wnt-responsive element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that EBP50 bound to genomic regions highly enriched with TCF/LEF binding motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of EBP50 in human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines compromised cell cycle progression, anchorage-independent growth, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We therefore suggest that nuclear EBP50 facilitates colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> by modulating the interaction between β-catenin and TCF-1 </plain></SENT>
