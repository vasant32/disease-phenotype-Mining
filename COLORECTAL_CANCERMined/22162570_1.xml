<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a paucity of prospective survival data for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (pcCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We characterized outcomes of patients with pcCRC enrolled onto two prospective randomized trials of chemotherapy and contrasted that with other manifestations of mCRC (non-pcCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2,095 patients enrolled onto two prospective randomized trials were evaluated for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the adjusted associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The characteristics of the pcCRC group (n = 364) were similar to those of the non-pcCRC patients in median age (63 v 61 years, P = .23), sex (57% males v 61%, P = .23), and performance status (Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status 0 or 1 94% v 96%, P = .06), but differed in frequency of liver (63% v 82%, P &lt; .001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> (27% v 34%, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median OS (12.7 v 17.6 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.5; P &lt; .001) and PFS (5.8 v 7.2 months, HR = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3; P = .001) were shorter for pcCRC versus non-pcCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The unfavorable prognostic influence of pcCRC remained after adjusting for age, PS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, and other factors (OS: HR = 1.3, P &lt; .001; PFS: HR = 1.1, P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was superior to irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil as a first-line treatment among pcCRC (HR for OS = 0.62, P = .005) and non-pcCRC patients (HR = 0.66, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: pcCRC is associated with a significantly shorter OS and PFS as compared with other manifestations of mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future trials for mCRC should consider stratifying on the basis of pcCRC status </plain></SENT>
