<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and short-term outcome of adjuvant chemotherapy with the FOLFOX regimen following liver resection for patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CRLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From May 2005 to September 2010, 86 patients with CRLM underwent hepatic resection in the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 24 received FOLFOX4 or modified FOLFOX6 as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen male and 5 female patients received adjuvant chemotherapy following liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (87.5 %) of these patients completed 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients required a dose reduction due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and the dose intensities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and 5-FU were 93.6 and 94.1 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no severe adverse events from the treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 48.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrences developed in 12 patients, and 3 patients died during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3- and 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 51.6 and 45.1 % and 95.5 and 76.0 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant FOLFOX is feasible and might provide a good prognosis for CRLM patients who undergo liver resection </plain></SENT>
