<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 4172 colonoscopies were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sex, age, number of positive squares, and colonoscopic and histopathologic findings were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the results obtained, 76.6% of positive tests were positive with one or two squares </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of positive squares was not related to sex, age and rank of participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> increased significantly with age, sex (male) and number of positive squares from 6.6% (one to two squares) to 27.6% (five to six squares) and from 15.2% to 22.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> was diagnosed 211 times (54.1%) and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was diagnosed 696 times (65.3%) following positive tests with one to two squares </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TNM stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> increased significantly with the number of positive squares: 85.8% of stages 0-1-2 for one to two positive squares and 66.3% for five to six positive squares (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> for male patients and aged persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of positive squares significantly increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (odds ratio=4.6 for five to six positive squares) and the risk of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (odds ratio=2.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age, sex and number of positive squares were independent predictive factors of positive guaiac faecal occult blood test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proportion of TNM stages 3-4 was significantly higher in those with five to six positive squares </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Performing a complete colonoscopy in every individual having a positive test, especially aged men with a high number of positive squares, should be a priority in any screening programme </plain></SENT>
