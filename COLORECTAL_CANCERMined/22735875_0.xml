<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after colonoscopic polypectomy is a rare, but serious complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify risk factors of delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after colonoscopic polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted in a single university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty cases and 120 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data collected included comorbidity, use of antiplatelet agents, size and number of resected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, histology and gross <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of resected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, endoscopist's experience, resection method, use of sedation, and use of prophylactic hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In univariate analysis, size, histology and number of resected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, endoscopist's experience, resection method and use of prophylactic hemostasis were significant risk factors for delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after colonoscopic polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, risk of delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> increased by 11.6% for every 1 mm increase in resected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> diameter (OR, 1.116; 95% CI 1.041-1.198; p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Number of resected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (OR, 1.364; 95% CI, 1.113-1.671; p=0.003) and endoscopist's experience (OR, 6.301; 95% CI, 2.022-19.637; p=0.002) were significant risk factors for delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after colonoscopic polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Size and numbers of resected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and endoscopist's experience were independent risk factors for delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after colonoscopic polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More caution would be necessary when removing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> with these factors </plain></SENT>
