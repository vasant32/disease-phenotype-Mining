<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MTSS1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> (precancerous lesion) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between MTSS1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and clinicopathologic factors was analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MTSS1 protein expression was observed by Western blot in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and adjacent nontumor colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two factors between MTSS1 expression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (TNM) stage were analyzed by Spearman rank correlation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were employed to compare the overall survival between MTSS1 negative/weak positive expression group and MTSS1 strong positive expression group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MTSS1 expression rates were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues (99 out of 135, 73.30%) than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues (one out of seven, 14.29%), nontumor colorectal tissues (six out of 32, 18.75%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> tissues (four out of 15, 26.67%; P = 0.003, P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The upregulated MTSS1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues was significantly correlated to poor differentiation (P = 0.005), tissue invasion (P = 0.018), high preoperative CEA level (P = 0.022), present lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P = 0.003), and high TNM stage (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MTSS1 expression was positively correlated with clinical TNM stage, that suggested the more advanced clinical TNM stage corresponding to the higher expression level of MTSS1 (r(s) = 0.327, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Western blotting demonstrated that MTSS1 expression was upregulated in 25 of 32 CRC tissues (75.0%) compared to corresponding adjacent nontumor colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival of MTSS1 strong positive expression <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was significantly shorter than that of MTSS1 negative and weakly positive expression group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, MTSS1 expression maintained independent prognostic influence on overall survival (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MTSS1 may be a good biomarker to be applied in the clinical setting to predict the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with completely resected </plain></SENT>
