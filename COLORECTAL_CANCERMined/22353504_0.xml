<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The expression of galectin-1 in peritumor, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues using immunohistochemistry, western-blotting and RT-PCR was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum galectin-1 concentrations were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Galectin-1 intensities in peritumor, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues increased serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Galectin- 1 expressed in the extracellular matrix of peritumor and pathological colorectal tissues mainly, while almost none was detected in colorectal epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different colorectal tissues expressed galectin-1 with different intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-parametric tests showed increased galectin-1 intensities were in peritumor, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The over-expressing rates of galectin-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> from Dukes A to D stage were increased significantly (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differently expressing intensities of galectin-1 were in different invasive locations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR showed that no statistically significant differences of galectin-1 mRNA were observed among peritumor colorectal tissue, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of galectin-1 decreased from healthy individuals to Dukes D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The differences between any of the groups were significant (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stronger intensities of galectin-1 protein in the extracellular matrix of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues than those of peritumor and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> tissues, with no significant differences in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of galectin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, serum galectin- 1 concentrations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, we presume that overexpression of galectin-1 protein in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> is derived possibly from secreted galectin-1 from other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues that cumulate in the stroma </plain></SENT>
