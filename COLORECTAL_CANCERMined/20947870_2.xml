<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On this premise, the authors aimed to verify whether progression risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677947" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage I colorectal cancer</z:e> may be related to LVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors also evaluated and correlated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression with LVD revealed in the same cases in order to investigate its potential lymphangiogenic role in the early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LVD and VEGF immunoexpression were analysed and compared in series of 29 stage I surgically resected colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> obtained from patients showing disease progression and in a cohort of 23 stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> from patients with no evidence of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of LVD and of VEGF expression on the progression-free survival to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high density of peritumoural lymphatics (P-LVD) was significantly associated with high VEGF expression and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, high P-LVD and high VEGF expression were significant negative prognostic parameters associated with a shorter disease-free interval in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677947" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage I colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: If our findings are further confirmed in other studies, the assessment of P-LVD on surgical specimens might be used as a tool to identify patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677947" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage I colorectal cancer</z:e> at higher risk of progression in order to submit them to adjuvant therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since P-LVD seems to show a VEGF-A mediated regulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677947" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage I colorectal cancer</z:e>, therapies targeting this factor might be exploited to reduce lymphangiogenesis and the progression risk of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
