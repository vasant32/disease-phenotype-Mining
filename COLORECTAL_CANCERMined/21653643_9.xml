<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines recent national trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test use, including among vulnerable populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2008 National Health Interview Survey to examine national trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening use overall and for fecal occult blood test (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also assessed trends by race/ethnicity, educational attainment, income, time in the United States, and access to health care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 2000 to 2008, significant declines in FOBT and sigmoidoscopy use and significant increases in colonoscopy use and in the percentages of adults up-to-date with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening occurred overall and for most population subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroups with consistently lower rates of colonoscopy use and being up-to-date included Hispanics; people with minimal education, low income, or no health insurance; recent immigrants; and those with no usual source of care or physician visits in the past year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among up-to-date adults, there were few subgroup differences in the type of test by which they were up-to-date (i.e., FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and colonoscopy increased among U.S. adults, including those from vulnerable populations, 45% of adults aged 50 to 75-or nearly 35 million people-were not up-to-date with screening in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Continued monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates among population subgroups with consistently low utilization is imperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> population groups in the United States is still needed </plain></SENT>
