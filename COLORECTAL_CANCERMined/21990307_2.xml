<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ginger has shown downregulation of COX in vitro and decreased incidence/multiplicity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine if 2.0 g/d of ginger could decrease the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2), 13-hydroxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25627">octadecadienoic acids</z:chebi>, and 5-, 12-, and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-, 12-, and 15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi>), in the colon mucosa of healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate this aim, we randomized 30 subjects to 2.0 g/d ginger or placebo for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flexible sigmoidoscopy at baseline and day 28 was used to obtain colon biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was used to determine eicosanoid levels in the biopsies, and levels were expressed per protein or per free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in mean percent change between baseline and day 28 for any of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi>, when normalized to protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in mean percent change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) (P = 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28209">5-HETE</z:chebi> (P = 0.04), and a trend toward significant decreases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> (P = 0.09) and 15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi> (P = 0.06) normalized to free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, it seems that ginger has the potential to decrease eicosanoid levels, perhaps by inhibiting their synthesis from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ginger also seemed to be tolerable and safe </plain></SENT>
