<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify predictors of response to neoadjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues as source of genetic materials and microarray analysis as investigation tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After optimization of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extraction methods from FFPE, microarray analysis was carried out on total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from 12 pre-treatment FFPE rectal tissues using Megaplex pool A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microarray data were analysed using an artificial neural network algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis and correlation with clinicopathological data was performed using SPSS software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A distinct miRNA expression signature predictive of response to neoadjuvant CRT in 12 FFPE pre-treatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> tissue samples was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These signatures consisted of three miRNA transcripts (miR-16, miR-590-5p and miR-153) to predict complete vs. incomplete response and two miRNA transcript (miR-519c-3p and miR-561) to predict good vs. poor response with a median accuracy of 100 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using microarray analysis of pretreatment FFPE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> tissues, we identified for the first time a group of miRNA predictors of response to neoadjuvant CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This, indeed, can lead to a significant improvement in patient selection criteria and personalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> management </plain></SENT>
