<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> aged over 80 years were identified from a computer database, and their clinical variables were analysed by both univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 104 patients underwent resective surgery, 87% radical and 13% palliative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality was 5%, being associated with a number of coexisting diseases and the presence of postoperative complications, especially anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 5-year survival was 33%, the median survival was 31 months and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific 5-year survival was 36% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate after radical surgery was 30%, being 13%, 25%, 44% and 100% in the Union for International <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Control stages I, II, III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates indicated that age, number of underlying diseases, radicality of operation, Dukes' staging, size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, number of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, metastasised disease, venous invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> were significant predictors of survival, but in the Cox regression model, only venous invasion was an independent prognostic factor of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low mortality and acceptable survival can be achieved even in very elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Venous invasion is an independent predictor of survival </plain></SENT>
