<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review with meta-analyses of observational studies of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and colorectal, breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The literature of December 2009 was searched without language restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The meta-regression analysis was done to compute dose-response effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because in case-control studies, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is measured after the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, separate analyses for case-control and prospective studies were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 35 independent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The seven studies on colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in terms of endpoint and control for major confounding factors, and we did not perform a meta-analysis of these data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The summary relative risk (SRR) and (95% confidence interval) for a 10 ng/ml increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 0.85 (0.79; 0.91) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (2,630 cases in 9 studies); 0.89 (0.81;0.98) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (6,175 cases in 10 studies); and 0.99 (0.95;1.03) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> (3,956 cases in 11 studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, case-control studies (3,030 cases) had major limitations and obtained SRR of 0.83 (0.79; 0.87) whereas SRR of prospective studies (3,145 cases) was 0.97 (0.92; 1.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, differences between cases and controls in the season of blood draw or in overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or physical inactivity could not explain the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a consistent inverse relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association was found for breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
