<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To identify and describe changes in spleen volume occurring in patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> to the liver after partial hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients (20 men, 21 women) with histopathology-proven colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> who underwent partial hepatectomy between August 2007 and April 2011 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liver and spleen volumes were measured by computed tomography (CT) volumetry on the most recent CT prior to surgery and on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CTs obtained within a year after partial hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were carefully evaluated for and excluded if they had co-morbid conditions known to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> or risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> such as underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> and portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two (78%) patients demonstrated an increase in spleen volume on the first post-operative CT, with more than a double increase in volume amongst five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spleen volume increased by an average of 43% within 3 months of partial hepatectomy (p &lt; 0.0001) and remained increased through 6 months after surgery, returning to near baseline thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining nine (22%) patients, the spleen was observed to decrease an average of 11% in volume on first postoperative CT (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Splenic enlargement after partial hepatectomy of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> is a common finding on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased familiarity amongst radiologists of this phenomenon as likely reflecting physiological changes is important in order to avoid unnecessary evaluation for underlying conditions causing interval enlargement of the spleen </plain></SENT>
