<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,040 patients were prospectively included between 2005 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LS screening modalities included the Bethesda criteria, immunochemistry (IHC) for MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6, and microsatellite instability (MSI) by using pentaplex markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation was assessed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a loss of MLH1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene sequencing was offered to patients with abnormal IHC or MSI status without promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 105 patients had an abnormal result: 102 (9.8%) exhibited a loss of protein on IHC and 98 (9.4%) had MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A discordant result was observed in 10 patients with eventual proven LS in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of MLH1 (n = 64) was due to promoter methylation in 43 patients (67.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, of 62 patients with an abnormal result, 38 had genetic sequencing leading to 25 (65.8%) identified with a germ-line mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss of MSH2 on IHC was associated with a mutation in 78.3% (18 of 23) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 62 patients with abnormal results, 23 (37.1%) did not meet the Bethesda criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Strict application of the Bethesda criteria does not lead to identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IHC and MSI testing are complementary methods and should be used in association to identify potential LS patients </plain></SENT>
