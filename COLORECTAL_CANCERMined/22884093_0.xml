<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern and identify the potential clinical significance of PABPC4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 26.7% (27/101 patients) of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> and 60.5% (23/38 patients) of corresponding adjacent, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues showed high cytoplasmic expression of PABPC4, whereas expression was absent in 98% (43/44 patients) of distant, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we observed that the expression of PABPC4 was significantly correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with stage II and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> (P=0.022 and P=0.020, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PABPC4 expression was positively associated with survival outcome, and may have predictive value in the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings indicate that PABPC4 may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
