<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with BV for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From July 2007 to October 2008, 59 patients were treated by chemotherapy with BV in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 47 patients who received BV in first-line therapy, 3 cases (6%) with complete response (CR), 25 cases(53%) with partial response (PR), and 17 cases (36%) with stable disease (SD) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control rate were 60% and 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 12 patients treated first with BV in second-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients, 1 case (8%) with CR, 3 cases (25%) with PR, and 4 (33%) with SD were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control rate were 33% and 67%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median PFS was 6.0 months and median OS was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With regard to the grade 3 to 4 adverse events by NCI-CTCAE ver3.0, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was observed in more than half of the patients (56%), but a few of patients had gastrointestinal toxicities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in non-hematologic toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BV-associated adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, wound healing complication, gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, each of which were few and not serious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six of the patients experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> after first-line therapy treated with BV continuously in second-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four of six were surviving without disease progression at the last follow-up, which suggests the effectiveness of continuation of BV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our study showed the efficacy and safety of BV for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
