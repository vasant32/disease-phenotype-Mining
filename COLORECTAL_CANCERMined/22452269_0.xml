<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients participated in a prospective explorative pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were nonresectable liver-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> determined by CT/MRI-, PET/CT- scans and colonoscopy, and ECOG 0-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was QoL assessed by the EORTC-C30 questionnaires at baseline, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after Ltx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients' age ranged from 50 to 63 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of 10 patients were observed for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient did not return the form at 6 months and died shortly after because of recurrence of the malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to baseline, Ltx resulted in sustained excellent global health status scale (score of 100) in one patient, improved scores in 4 and unchanged scores in 3 patients at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients also reported good functional scores at follow-ups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although two patients had marked symptoms both before and after Ltx, the patients in general reported low levels of pain and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with liver-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> who receive Ltx have good QoL and have mostly minor symptoms the first year after Ltx </plain></SENT>
