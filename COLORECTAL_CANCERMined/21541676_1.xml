<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various genetic factors have been reported to be involved in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> including Axin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Axin, a major scaffold protein, plays an important role in various bio signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aim to study mutational pattern of Axin gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients of Kashmiri population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue specimens of 50 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were used in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DNA preparations were evaluated for the occurrence of Axin 1 and Axin 2 gene mutations by direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed exon 1a, 1b, 1c, 2, 4, 6, and 10 of Axin 1 and exon 7 of Axin 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found a novel mutation of G&gt;T (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>&gt;TCT) transversion in exon 7 of Axin 2 gene at codon G695T (p.alanine &gt;Â serine) at a frequency of 6% (3/50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the same exon of Axin 2 gene a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected in codon L688L (CCT&gt;CTT) at a frequency of 36% (18/50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In exon 1c of Axin 1 a SNP was detected at codon D726D (GAT&gt;GAC) at a frequency of 62.5% (31/50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both the SNPs were synonymous hence do not lead to change of amino acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although Axin 1 and Axin 2 gene mutations have been found to be involved in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, it seems to be a relatively rare event in Kashmiri population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, an interesting finding of this study is the novelty of Axin 2 gene mutations which may be a predisposing factor in ethnic Kashmiri population to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
