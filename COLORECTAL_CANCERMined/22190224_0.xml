<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the evidence for such a relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedicine Databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CYP1B1 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were calculated in a fixed-effects model and a random-effects model when appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pooled ORs were performed for co-dominant model (GG vs. CC, GC vs. CC), dominant model (GG + GC vs. CC), and recessive model (GG vs. GC + CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis included ten case-control studies, which included 8,466 CRC cases and 9,301 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the variant genotypes (GG and GC) of the 432 C/G were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk when compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CC homozygote (GG vs. CC, OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.93-1.10; GC vs. CC, OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.90-1.04), without any between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no associations were found in the dominant and recessive models (dominant model, OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.92-1.05; recessive model, OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.96-1.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Limiting the analysis to the studies within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the results were persistent and robust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When stratifying for country, matched control and source of controls, no evidence of significant association was observed in any subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No publication bias was found in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association is found between the CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
