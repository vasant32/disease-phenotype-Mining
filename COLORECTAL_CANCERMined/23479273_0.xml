<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of octogenarians increased from 2009 to 2011, which was associated with an increased patient risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 70  % of patients ≥ 80 years old the operative risk was preoperatively classified as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> stages III and IV </plain></SENT>
