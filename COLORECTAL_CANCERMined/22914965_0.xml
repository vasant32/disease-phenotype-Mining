<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A fluorescent orthotopic transplantation model of HCT-116 cells was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment groups were administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> 50 mg/kg (G2), 100 mg/kg (G3), and 200 mg/kg (G4), and the negative control group (G1) was administered 5 % NaHCO(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The volume and vascular density of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, body weights, survival conditions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates of the mice were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the 14th, 21st, and 28th days, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume in the treatment groups was significantly smaller than that in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiment, the survival rate of the experimental animals in the G3 was significantly higher than that in the G1 and G4 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in both the weights and surface vascular densities of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e> among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">Baicalin</z:chebi> had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse orthotopic xenografts consisting of human HCT-116 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells that are deficient in the mismatch repair gene hMLH1 </plain></SENT>
