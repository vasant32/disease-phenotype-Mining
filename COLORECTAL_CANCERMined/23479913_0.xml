<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After introducing "BOKUTOH enhanced recvery after surgery (ERAS)" protocol for colorectal surgery in our hospital, the hospital stay after surgery was reduced from 10 days to 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the patients' quality of life (QOL) throughout the perioperative period was not quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the QOL of these patients by using QoR-40J and SF-36v2J (Japanese versions of QoR-40 and SF-36v2) questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients undergoing surgery and "BOKUTOH ERAS" protocol management were asked to answer both QoR-40 J and SF-36v2J questionnaires pre- and post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scores were evaluated by using Mann-Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From preoperative score (183.5), the scores of QoR-40 J differed significantly on post-operating day (POD) 1 and POD3 (150.9 [15.7] and 168.1 [17.5] points, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before leaving the hospital (POD6) and after one month from surgery, both QoR40 J and SF-36v2J scores were similar to preoperative ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Under "BOKUTOH ERAS" protocol management, patients who had had colorectal surgery were able to recover their QOL within 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, leaving hospital by 7 days after surgery was appropriate to our patients </plain></SENT>
