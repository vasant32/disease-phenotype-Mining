<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The study was designed as a retrospective observational study conducted over a three-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A paired case-control design was used to analyze the effect of postoperative iron on patients' blood transfusion needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups were established (the case group, which received postoperative iron and the control group, which did not) and matched for age (± 3 years), gender, type of operation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, and surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 342 patients who underwent operation, 104 paired patients were obtained for inclusion in this study (52 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second analysis was made to assess the effect of intravenous iron on the evolution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> between the first postoperative day and hospital discharge in the subgroup of patients with reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, in subjects without preoperative or postoperative transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, a total of 71 patients were paired in two groups: 37 and 31 patients in case and control, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration at discharge for the case group was 10 ± 1.1 g/dl, vs. 10.6 ± 1.2 in the controls (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of transfusions in the case group was 3 ± 1.6, vs. 3.3 ± 3 in the control group (P = 0.682) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, 28.8 % of the patients in the case group received transfusions, versus 30.8 % of those in the control group (P = 0.830) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the second analysis, the decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was 0.88 g/dl and 0.82 g/dl in case and control, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous iron does not appear to reduce the blood transfusion requirements in the postoperative period of colorectal surgery patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We consider that further studies are needed to more clearly define the usefulness of intravenous iron in reducing the transfusion needs in such patients </plain></SENT>
