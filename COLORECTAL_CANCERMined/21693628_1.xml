<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamins B2 and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> have inconsistently been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, and there have been no previous studies relating plasma concentrations of methionine, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>, and betaine to this outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study comprised 10,601 individuals, 50 to 64 years of age, participating in the Norwegian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Prevention (NORCCAP) screening study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression analyses, we crosssectionally investigated associations between distal colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> occurrence-potential precursor lesions of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>-and plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> donors and B-vitamins, and polymorphisms of genes related to one-carbon metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Screening revealed 1,809 subjects (17.1%) with at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (observed in 421 subjects) was inversely associated with plasma concentrations of methionine (highest versus lowest quartile: odds ratio (OR) = 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.83), betaine: OR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.54-1.02, the vitamin B2 form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24041">flavin-mononucleotide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17621">FMN</z:chebi>): OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.49-0.88, and the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi> form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18405">pyridoxal 5'-phosphate</z:chebi> (PLP): OR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.51-0.95, but not with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> concentrations, or with the studied polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High methionine concentration in combination with high vitamin B2 or B6 concentrations was associated with lower occurrence of high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> compared with these factors individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High plasma concentrations of methionine and betaine, and vitamins B2 and B6 may reduce risk of developing colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: In addition to B-vitamins, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> donors such as methionine and betaine may play a role in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
