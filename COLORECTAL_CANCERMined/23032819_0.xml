<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aims: In this study we aimed to detect the expression of exon 3 mutations of β-catenin in colorectal TSA, TA/VTA, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry staining for β-catenin was performed for 30 TSA, 20 tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (TA)/villous tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (VTA), and 21 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing of the exon 3 of β-catenin gene was performed for 8 TSA cases, 6 TA cases, 5 VTA cases, and 10 CRC cases with positive staining in the nuclei and cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A Fisher exact test and chi-square test were used to analyze the differentiations of the expression of β-catenin in TSA, TA/VTA, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results : The percentages of β-catenin expression in TSA, TA/VTA, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 76.6% (23/30), 70.0% (14/20), and 95.2% (20/21), respectively, and were significantly different among these three types of tissue specimens (χ2 = 22.805, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although β-catenin expression levels in TSA were not related to it in TA/VTA, they were significantly different between TSA/TA/VTA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was well correlated with β-catenin expression (TSA: P &lt; 0.01; TA/VTA: P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But β-catenin exon 3 mutations were not detected in any of these tissue specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant β-catenin expression is associated with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in TSA. β-catenin likely plays an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal TSA and conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
