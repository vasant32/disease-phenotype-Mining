<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biological function of classical ARM family members such as Î²-catenin is well understood, but that of the ALEX/ARMCX family members is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we evaluate the effects of ALEX1 overexpression on in vitro colony formation ability and expression of ALEX1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of ALEX1 suppressed the anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation of human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines by the study of stable clones of HCT116 cells expressing ALEX1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi> genomic sequencing revealed that the promoter region of ALEX1 gene was highly methylated in both HCT116 and SW480 cells in comparison with PANC-1 and MCF-7 cells, which express endogenous ALEX1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, indicating the capability of promoter methylation to silence ALEX1 gene in HCT116 and SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our current findings suggest that overexpression of ALEX1 play a negative role in human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
