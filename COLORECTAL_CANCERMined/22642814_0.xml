<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, we focused on the family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Young Japanese subjects aged 30-49 years old who underwent colonoscopy for the first time from August 2007 to August 2008 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 300 unselected consecutive patients (mean age 40.5 years) were eligible for analysis, and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, sex, age, body mass index, positivity of faecal occult blood test and the presence of symptoms were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for developing colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> were detected in 83 (27.7%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two were found to have invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.12-3.92, P = 0.02) was an independent risk factor for the development of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, as well as male sex (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.10-3.27, P = 0.02), older age (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.18-3.55, P = 0.01) and positive faecal occult blood test (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.14-3.48, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the young population under 50 years of age, a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> is an independent risk factor for the development of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
