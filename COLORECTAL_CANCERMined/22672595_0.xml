<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the lifetime risk of benign and malignant gastrointestinal lesions in patients with a proven PTEN mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data on gender, mutation, dates of birth, last contact, and diagnosis, location and type of gastrointestinal lesions were collected from nine countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lifetime risk of gastrointestinal lesions was calculated by Kaplan-Meier methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 156 patients (67 men, 43%) from 101 families with a PTEN mutation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were born between 1928 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Benign gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were reported in 49 (31%) patients at a mean age of 38 years (range 18-62 years) and were most often <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (44%) patients had upper as well as lower gastrointestinal lesions, 14 (29%) had only colonic lesions and 13 (27%) had gastrointestinal lesions at unknown sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of developing benign gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was 70% at age 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients (two men) developed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at 53, 57, 59 and 62 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of developing colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was 18% at age 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Except for one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid</z:hpo> in the small intestine, no upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Benign gastrointestinal lesions are common in PTEN mutation carriers, and a three- to four-fold increased lifetime risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared with the general population may exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Colorectal screening of patients with germline PTEN mutations is recommended, starting at age 40 years </plain></SENT>
