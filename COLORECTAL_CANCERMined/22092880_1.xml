<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With recommendations for earlier discharge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors, attention to the discharge process is likely to become increasingly important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explored <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors' experiences of discharge from hospital follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survivors of breast, colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> (n= 1275), 5-16 years post diagnosis were approached to take part in a questionnaire survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire included questions about discharge status, provision of time/information prior to discharge, feelings at discharge and satisfaction with how discharge was managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Completed questionnaires were returned by 659 survivors (51.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of respondents were not discharged from follow-up 5-16 years post diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those discharged, a substantial minority reported insufficient time (27.9%), information (24.5-45.0%) or adverse emotions (30.9%) at the time of discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 90.6% of respondents reported satisfaction with how discharge from hospital follow-up was managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite high levels of satisfaction, discharge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors from hospital follow-up could be improved with the provision of additional time, information and support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Better structuring of the final hospital appointment or a review appointment in primary care at this time could help to ensure that discharge from hospital follow-up is managed optimally for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
