<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Totally, 53 fresh tumoral tissue specimens were investigated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens were obtained during routine surgery of patients who were histopathologically diagnosed and genotyped for common KRAS and BRAF point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After DNA extraction, the target mutations were analyzed using the AutoGenomics INFINITI(Â®) assay, and some samples were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction fluorescence melting curve analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutations were found in 26 (49.05%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven samples (50.95%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> profiles for KRAS codon 12, 13, and 61 in the current cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 17 (65.38%) samples, codon 12; in 7 (26.93%) samples, codon 13; and in 2 (7.69%) samples, codon 61 were found to be mutated, particularly in grade 2 of tumoral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No point mutation was detected in BRAF codon Val600Glu for the studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study, based on a representative collection of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, indicates that KRAS gene mutations were detected in 49.05% of the samples, and the most frequent mutation was in the G12D codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results also showed that codons 12 and 13 of KRAS are relatively frequently without BRAF mutation in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cohort from the Turkish population </plain></SENT>
