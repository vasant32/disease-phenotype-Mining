<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the low abundance differentially expressed proteins in colorectal cancerous tissues as compared to colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Protein separation was carried out by using the coupling methods of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatite</z:chebi> chromatography and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of the membrane associated low abundance proteins, namely uncharacterized protein C5orf4, coiled-coil domain containing protein 152, DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 22, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor candidate 3 and leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal protein 4 that previously only reported at the genome level were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proteins were isolated from the cancerous tissues as either up-regulated or down-regulated proteins as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and therefore may play important roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
