<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the identification and validation of the ninth component of complement (C9) as a novel plasma biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by cutting-edge proteomic technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma proteins were enzymatically digested into a large array of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and the relative quantity of a total of 94,803 peptide peaks was compared between 31 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 59 age/sex-matched healthy controls using 2D image-converted analysis of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The selected biomarker candidates were validated in 345 subjects (115 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 230 age/sex-matched healthy controls) using high-density reverse-phase protein microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of Apo AI and C9 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients significantly differed from healthy controls with P values of 7.94×10(-4) and 1.43×10(-12) (Student's t-test), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, C9 was elevated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, including those with stage-I and -II diseases (P=3.01×10(-3) and P=1.13×10(-5) , respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the significance of the present study must be validated in an independent clinical study, the increment of plasma C9 may be applicable to the early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
