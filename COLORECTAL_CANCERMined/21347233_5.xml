<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, ZIC1 has also been found to participate in the progression of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastomas</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancers</z:e>, and mesenchymal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the function of ZIC1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> progression has not been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate ZIC1 to be silenced or significantly downregulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects were reversed by demethylation treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (Aza) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ZIC1 expression is also significantly downregulated in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues relative to adjacent non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, methylation of ZIC1 gene promoter is frequently detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> tissues (85%, 34/40), but not in adjacent non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of ZIC1 suppresses cell proliferation and induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which is associated with MAPK and PI(3)K/Akt pathways, as well as the Bcl-xl/Bad/Caspase3 cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To identify target candidates of ZIC1, we employed cDNA microarray and found that 337 genes are downregulated and 95 genes upregulated by ectopic expression of ZIC1, which were verified by 10 selected gene expressions by qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that ZIC1 may potentially function as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, which is downregulated through promoter hypermethylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
