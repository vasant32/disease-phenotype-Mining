<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this trial was to compare the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program with conventional perioperative management in patients who underwent radical resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A combination of evidence-based and consensus methodology was used to develop the ERAS protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five hundred ninety-seven consecutive patients who underwent elective colorectal resection were randomized to either the ERAS (n = 299) or the control group (n = 298) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes relating to nutrition and metabolism index, stress index, and recovery index were measured and recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Demographic and operative data were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the ERAS group showed improved nutritional status when compared with those of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day (POD) 1, the HOMA-IR (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index) of the ERAS group was lower than that of the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> level of the control group was elevated on both POD 1 (p = 0.007) and POD 5 (p = 0.002) compared to the preoperative level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> level of the ERAS group was not increased until POD 5 (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ in the ERAS group indicated less postoperative stress responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, ERAS was associated with accelerated recovery of gastrointestinal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postoperative length of stay (p &lt; 0.001) and expense (p &lt; 0.001) for the ERAS group were reduced in comparison to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight cases in the control group and twenty-nine in the ERAS group suffered complications, which was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ERAS protocol attenuates the surgical stress response and accelerates postoperative recovery without compromising patient safety </plain></SENT>
