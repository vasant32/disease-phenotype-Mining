<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction: The effectiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening programs depends on repeated participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known on later rounds in programs that use the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), in particular whether previous participants are likely to participate again, and if non-participants persist in declining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared overall participation in a second round to that in a first round, and evaluated differences in participation rates based on previous response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: Asymptomatic persons aged 50-74 years were invited to a second round of a FIT-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening pilot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the participation rate overall and within second round subgroups of previous participants, previous non-participants, and first time invitees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also assessed whether participation rates were similar for males and females and for age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: In the first screening round, 2871 of 5309 invitees returned the FIT (participation rate of 57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was higher than in the second in which 3187 of 5925 participated (54%; p=0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Second round participation rate was 85% (2034/2385) among previous participants, 18% (325/1826) among previous non-participants and 48% (828/1714) among first time invitees (p&lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, males and persons aged under 55 were less likely to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Participation in a second round of FIT-screening was significantly lower than in the first round, largely due to a drop in participation in first round participants, and a relatively low response among first time invitees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This loss of uptake was partially compensated by a willingness to be screened in previous non-participants </plain></SENT>
