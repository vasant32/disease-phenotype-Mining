<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain are frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, to date, only very few, mainly non-European, studies have reported rare EGFR mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 236 clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from European patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by direct DNA sequencing to detect potential, as yet unknown mutations, in the EGFR gene exons 18 to 21, mainly covering the EGFR TK catalytic domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EGFR sequences showed somatic missense mutations in exons 18 and 20 at a frequency of 2.1% and 0.4% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Somatic SNPs were also found in exons 20 and 21 at a frequency of about 3.1% and 0.4% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these mutations, four have not yet been described elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These mutation frequencies are higher than in a similarly sized population characterized by Barber and colleagues, but still too low to account for a major role played by the EGFR gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
