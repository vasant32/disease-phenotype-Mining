<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations can be detected in more than 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most recently, regimens that include anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several recent studies have shown that patients with KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> do not benefit from anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the aim to determine KRAS status as predictive biomarker, 7 known mutations ofKRAS gene in codons 12 or 13 on 44 CRC samples were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After DNA extraction from paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue blocks, KRAS mutations were analysed using quantitative real-time PCR with internationally certified method, for the first time in Croatia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected in 12 tumor samples: five patients with Gly12Val (GGT&gt;<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>), three with Gly12Asp (GGT&gt;GAT), two patients with Gly13Asp (GGC&gt;GAC), one patient with Gly12Ser (GGT&gt;<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) and one with Gly12Cys (GGT&gt;TGT) mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data about KRAS mutational status in the sample of Croatian population diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have shown that incidence of KRAS mutation is 27%, which is consistent with results already reported worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The final result must be a proper selection of the correct therapy with EGFR inhibitors for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> which is critical for improving clinical outcomes, unnecessary toxicities, side effects and financial cost </plain></SENT>
