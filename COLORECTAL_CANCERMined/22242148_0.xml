<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed this protein biochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SRPX2 protein was secreted with a highly posttranslational modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chondroitinase ABC treatment completely decreased the molecular mass of purified SRPX2 protein to its predicted size, whereas heparitinase, keratanase and hyaluroinidase did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secreted SRPX2 protein was also detected using an anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that SRPX2 is a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> (CSPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a binding assay revealed that hepatocyte growth factor dose-dependently binds to SRPX2 protein, and a ligand-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> interaction was speculated to be likely in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding its molecular architecture, SRPX2 has sushi repeat modules similar to four other CSPGs/lecticans; however, the molecular architecture of SRPX2 seems to be quite different from that of the lecticans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we found that SRPX2 is a novel CSPG that is overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide key glycobiological insight into SRPX2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and demonstrate that SRPX2 is a new member of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> family </plain></SENT>
