<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We picked up the incidence data of 111 281 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in total from National Central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry Database between 1998 and 2007, covering 446 734 668 person-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> both by area and gender were calculated; while the age standardized rate (ASR) was standardized by world's population age structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence trend was analyzed and the annual percentage change (APC) was calculated by JoinPoint software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-Period-Cohort Bayesian Model was applied to fit the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence trend in China between 1998 and 2007; and further to predict its incidence between 2008 and 2015 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1998 to 2007, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> registered incidence was 24.91/100 000 (111 281/446 734 668), with the ASR at 17.67/100 000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence in male population was 26.50/100 000 (60 015/226 508 545), with ASR at 19.90/100 000; and the incidence in female was 23.28/100 000 (51 266/220 226 123), with ASR at 15.73/100 000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In urban area, the male incidence rose from 23.29/100 000 (2617/11 237 967) in 1998 to 37.84/100 000 (8534/22 551 353) in 2007; while the female incidence increased from 21.75/100 000 (2357/10 838 355) to 31.34/100 000 (6913/22 057 787) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>And in rural areas, the male and female incidences rose from 10.36/100 000 (448/4 323 628) and 8.86/100 000 (372/4 197 806) in 1998 to 16.80/100 000 (1290/7 677 484) and 13.00/100 000 (978/7 522 690) in 2007 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this decade, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence has increased both in urban and rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In urban area, the male APC value was 5.5% and the female APC value was 4.0%; while in rural area, the male and female APC values were 6.0% and 4.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjusted by age structure, the uptrend became gently; with the urban male and urban female APC values separately increased by 3.7%, 2.5% and 2.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rural male APC value rocketed up by 8.4% after its inflection point in 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Bayesian model predicted that the male and female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidences would separately reach 33.92/100 000 (125 thousand cases) and 27.13/100 000 (93 thousand cases) in urban areas; and 13.61/100 000 (48 thousand cases) and 13.68/100 000 (45 thousand cases) in rural areas by year 2015 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence in China has been increasing annually; and it will continue to rise in the next years </plain></SENT>
