<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety profile and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of rmhTNF-α were suited for clinical use according to biological Investigational New Drug application, a standard guideline for new drug investigation in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluate the activity and safety of rmhTNF-α combined with chemotherapies in head/neck, lung, colorectal, stomach, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740457" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">renal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five eligible patients received i.m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rmhTNF-α treatment combined with standard chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another 95 patients were treated with standard chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After two treatment cycles, one patient achieved a complete response and 24 patients had partial response, yielding an overall response rate (complete response + partial response) of 27.47% in the rmhTNF-α plus chemotherapy cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The chemotherapy alone group acquired only a 11.39% response rate (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared between different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, a 48.89% response rate was detected in the 45 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients of the combination cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 1-2 adverse events of rmhTNF-α were drug-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e>, flu-like symptoms, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in grade 3-4 toxicities between the two cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of this research, rmhTNF-α can significantly enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An extended phase III trial of rmhTNF-α combined with standard chemotherapy is warranted for evaluating its antitumor activity and toxicity in a larger cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The studies in this paper were registered with the State Food and Drug Administration of China (No. 2003S00692) </plain></SENT>
