<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the levels of different <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers were comparatively assessed in patients who underwent laparoscopic or conventional resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (LS) or open surgery (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi>, protein, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, and nitrogen damage was investigated by measuring serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostanes</z:chebi> (8-epiPGF(2α)), protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyls</z:chebi> (PC), 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of the study was to analyze and compare serum levels of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative serum levels of 8-epiPGF(2α), 3-NT, and 8-OHG were significantly lower in the LS group at 24 h after surgery (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 6 h postoperatively, the levels of 8-epiPGF(2α) and 3-NT were significantly lower in the LS group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference in the levels of PC was found between the two groups at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the OS group, postoperative levels of 8-epiPGF(2α) were significantly lower than the preoperative values (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the LS group, the postoperative values of 8-epiPGF(2α), 3-NT, and 8-OHG were significantly lower than the preoperative values (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is associated with lower <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> compared to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>8-epiPGF(2α) was the most suitable marker for readily defining the oxidative status in patients who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
