<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> with DLD-1 cancer cells was produced in the right hind limbs of five mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were irradiated with 3 fractions of 3 Gy each for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline and follow up DCE-MRI were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative parameters (K(trans), K(ep) and V(e)) were calculated based on the Tofts model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early changes in K(trans), standard deviation (SD) of K(trans), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume were also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> responses were evaluated based on histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a cut-off value of 0.4 for necrotic factor, a comparison between good and poor responses was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The good response group (mice #1 and 2) exhibited higher pretreatment K(trans) than the poor response group (mice #3, 4, and 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The good response group tended to show lower pretreatment K(ep), higher pretreatment V(e), and larger baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume than the poor response group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the mice in the good response group demonstrated marked reductions in K(trans) and SD value after the first radiation </plain></SENT>
