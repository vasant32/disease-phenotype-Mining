<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we conducted a decision analysis to compare different strategies for managing such individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a previously developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> microsimulation model, SimCRC, to calculate life-years and the lifetime number of colonoscopies (as a measure of required resources) for a cohort of 50-year-olds to whom FOBT-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is offered annually from 50 to 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared three management strategies for individuals with a prior fpFOBT: (i) resume screening in 10 years with 10-yearly colonoscopy (SwitchCol_long); (ii) resume screening in 1 year with annual FOBT (ContinueFOBT_Short) and (iii) resume screening in 10 years (i.e., the recommended interval following a negative colonoscopy) with annual FOBT (ContinueFOBT_long) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed sensitivity analyses on various parameters and assumptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When using different management strategies for individuals with a prior fpFOBT, the variation in the number of life-years gained relative to no screening was &lt;2%, whereas the variation in the lifetime number of colonoscopies was 23% (percentages are calculated as the maximum difference across strategies divided by the lowest number across strategies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ContinueFOBT_long strategy showed the lowest lifetime number of colonoscopies per life-year gained even when key assumptions were varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the ContinueFOBT_long strategy was advantageous regarding both clinical benefit and required resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifying an appropriate management strategy for individuals with a prior fpFOBT may substantially reduce required resources within a FOBT-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program without limiting its effectiveness </plain></SENT>
