<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between preoperative nutritional conditions, including prealbumin and albumin concentrations, and the risk of recurrence in cases with operable colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-eight patients who underwent elective colorectal resection were analyzed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the eligible cases, 56 (35.4%) had decreased serum prealbumin and 15 (9.5%) had decreased serum albumin preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 158 cases in this study, 18 (11.4%) had disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, lymphovascular invasion, serum albumin, prealbumin, and carcinoembryonic antigen were the factors significantly associated with disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only serum albumin was a predictor of the recurrence; however, serum prealbumin lost its significance on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence by Kaplan-Meier curves significantly differed among patients with low serum albumin and prealbumin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that prealbumin and albumin may be sensitive indicators of the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>; however, low serum albumin levels are more useful than prealbumin in predicting short-term disease recurrence in operable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
