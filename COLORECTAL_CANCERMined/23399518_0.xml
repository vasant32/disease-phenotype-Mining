<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some data suggest that telephone reminders may lead to greater participant enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients aged 50 to 70 years from family practice rosters were initially mailed invitations to participate in an RCT of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who did not respond were randomly allocated to follow-up invitations by either telephone or mail four weeks after the initial invitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was attendance for eligibility screening with the study nurse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After mailing invitations to 1,348 patients, 104 patients were initially enrolled in the RCT of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 952 patients who did not respond to the initial mailed invitation, we randomly allocated 480 to follow-up invitation by telephone and 472 to follow-up invitation by mail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Attendance for eligibility screening with the study nurse was more frequent when non-responders were followed-up by telephone (84/480, 17.5%) than by mail (43/472, 9.1%) (relative risk (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enrollment into the RCT was also greater among patients followed-up by telephone (59/480, 12.3%) compared to those followed-up by mail (35/472, 7.4%) (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.47, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Telephone-based follow-up results in greater enrollment compared to a mail-based method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings should be of interest to investigators conducting RCTs, particularly trials of screening interventions involving asymptomatic participants for which volunteer participation may be challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00865527 </plain></SENT>
