<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the correlation between the level of (18)F-fluoro-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> ((18)F-FDG) uptake and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (CRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty four patients with resected CRA and preoperative (18)F-FDG <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography - computed tomography data were investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the lesion was made with GLUT1 expression by immunohistochemistry and various clinicopathologic factors including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume, invasion depth, gross finding, and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SUVmax was 14.45 ± 7.0 in negative GLUT1 expression cases, 15.51 ± 5.7 in weak GLUT1 expression cases, and 16.52 ± 6.8 in strong GLUT1 expression cases, and there was no correlation between between GLUT1 expression and SUVmax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUVmax was significantly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant differences in SUVmax and GLUT1 expression among other clinicopathologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GLUT1 expression does not correlates significantly with (18)F-FDG uptake in CRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FDG uptake was increased with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume, which is statistically significant </plain></SENT>
