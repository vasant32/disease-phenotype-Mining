<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive colonoscopy reports of patients at average/high risk screening, or with a prior colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (CRN) by endoscopists who perform 11 000 procedures yearly, using a commercial computerized endoscopic report generator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A separate institutional database providing pathological results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Required documentation included patient demographics, history, procedure indications, technical descriptions, colonoscopy findings, interventions, unplanned events, follow-up plans, and pathology results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reports abstraction employed a standardized glossary with 10% independent data validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sample size calculations determined the number of reports needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundreds and fifty patients (63.2 ± 10.5 years, female: 42.8%, average risk: 38.5%, personal/family history of CRN: 43.3%/20.2%) were scoped in June 2009 by 8 gastroenterologists and 3 surgeons (mean practice: 17.1 ± 8.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedural indication and informed consent were always documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>14% provided a previous colonoscopy date (past <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removal information in 25%, but insufficient in most to determine surveillance intervals appropriateness) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most procedural indicators were recorded (exam date: 98.4%, medications: 99.2%, difficulty level: 98.8%, prep quality: 99.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> reports noted extent of visualization (cecum: 94.4%, with landmarks noted in 78.8% - photodocumentation: 67.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No procedural times were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eleven had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (44.4%) with anatomic location noted in 99.1%, size in 65.8%, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in 62.2%; removal was by cold biopsy in 25.2% (cold snare: 18%, snare cautery: 31.5%, unrecorded: 20.7%), 84.7% were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenomas</z:mpath> were noted in 24.8% (advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>: 7.6%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>: 0.4%) in this population with varying previous colonic investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This audit reveals lacking reported items, justifying additional research to optimize quality of reporting </plain></SENT>
