<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> drug trials are complicated further by multiple survival and response endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors of this report determined the frequency of reporting of time-to-event endpoints and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response outcomes in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and examined the relation between the year of publication and the reported effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> or equivalent agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search identified 144 RCTs that involved 35,853 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient characteristics, trial designs, and methods for endpoint reporting were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> or equivalent agents was analyzed in 3 time periods (pre-1990, 1990s, and 2000s) in 28,636 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine trials (90%) reported overall survival (OS) and response rates; whereas time to progression (44%), duration of response (43%), progression-free survival (22%), and time to treatment failure (12%) were reported less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for stable and progressive disease, the frequency of reporting of endpoints did not improve over the period studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median OS for patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> or equivalent agents increased significantly (from 9.4 months before 1990 to 13.5 months after 2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the same period, the rate of stable disease increased (38.2%, 40.5%, and 45.1% for pre-1990, 1990s, and 2000s, respectively; P = .004); whereas the rate of progressive disease decreased significantly (39.2%, 33.3%, and 27.8%, respectively; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Its likely that the increasing availability of alternative treatments and better supportive care improved OS, whereas the rates of stable and progressive disease altered because of changes in follow-up schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other intermediate endpoints (duration of response and time to progression) remained largely constant over the time course of the current study, making them superior benchmarks for comparison with future studies </plain></SENT>
