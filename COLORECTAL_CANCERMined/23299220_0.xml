<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Bevacizumab has been shown to increase progression free and overall survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant bevacizumab is commonly used in patients undergoing liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate whether bevacizumab is associated with increased rate of perioperative complications in patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing hepatic resection for CRLM who received chemotherapy and bevacizumab (group 1, n = 134), or chemotherapy alone (group 2, n��= 57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared demographics, surgical characteristics, and perioperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perioperative complications developed in 35 % of patients in group 1, and 47 % in group 2 (p = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those complications, 15 (11.2 %) in group 1, and 5 (8.8 %) in group 2 were considered major (p = 0.617) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom received preoperative bevacizumab, developed enteric leaks following combined liver and bowel resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of anastomotic leak in group 1 was 10 %, compared with 0 in group 2, p = 0.56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy along with bevacizumab was not associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications after hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Possible association of increased morbidity with simultaneous bowel and liver resections following bevacizumab administration was found and we recommend avoiding such treatment combination </plain></SENT>
