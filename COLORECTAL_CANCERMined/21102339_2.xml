<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, an increasing life span and an incidence of right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have been noted, which could require changes in age guidelines and screening methodology, especially for the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined this in our Jewish populations using Israel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry data, 1980-2008, computed by age groups, sex, ethnic groups, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients who were below 50 years of age, there was no significant increase in incidence except for men born in Israel (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients aged between 50 and 74 or more than 75 years there was an increased incidence (P&lt;0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the percentage for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients aged between 50 and 74 years decreased but those who were aged more than 75 years increased (P&lt;0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 45.3% of patients (39.1% aged â‰¥ 75 years) would not be electively screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was an increased trend (P&lt;0.001) for right-sided (from cecum to and including the splenic flexure) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients both 50-74 and more than 75 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During 1999-2008, as compared with patients aged between 50 and 74 years, those below 50 years were less likely to be diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 CRC and more likely have stage 3 or 4 CRC (P&lt;0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), whereas those aged more than 75 years were less likely to have stage 3 CRC (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results should influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening age guidelines, especially for 'healthy' individuals aged 75 years or more, and their need for noninvasive, but sensitive and specific pre-colonoscopy screening methodologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> stage in the patients aged below 50 years needs to make the treating physicians more aware of the fact that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> can occur even at this age </plain></SENT>
