<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past decade, the relationship between CYP2C9 common polymorphisms (R144C and I359L) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has been reported in various ethnic groups; however, these studies have yielded contradictory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate this inconsistency, we performed this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Databases including Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched to find relevant studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 13 articles involving 9,463 cases and 11,416 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the summary odds ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.89-1.06) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87-1.14) for CYP2C9 144C and 359L alleles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant results were observed using dominant or recessive genetic model for these polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the stratified analyses according to ethnicity and sex, no evidence of any gene-disease association was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the CYP2C9 may not be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
