<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Advanced cancer</z:e> and chemotherapy are both associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1373218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune system suppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We initiated a clinical trial in patients receiving chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> to determine if administration of GM-CSF in this setting was immunostimulatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June, 2003 and January, 2007, 20 patients were enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT00257322) in which they received 500 ug GM-CSF daily for 4 days starting 24 hours after each chemotherapy cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no toxicities or adverse events reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was obtained before chemotherapy/GM-CSF administration and 24 hours following the final dose of GM-CSF and evaluated for circulating dendritic cells and adaptive immune cellular subsets by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) expression of γ-interferon and T-bet transcription factor (Tbx21) by quantitative real-time PCR was performed as a measure of Th1 adaptive cellular immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-treatment (i.e., chemotherapy and GM-CSF) samples were evaluable for 16 patients, ranging from 1 to 5 cycles (median 3 cycles, 6 biologic sample time points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells were defined as lineage (-) and MHC class II high (+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 73% of patients had significant increases in circulating dendritic cells of ~3x for the overall group (5.8% to 13.6%, p = 0.02) and ~5x excluding non-responders (3.2% to 14.5%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect was sustained over multiple cycles for approximately half of the responders, but tachyphylaxis over subsequent chemotherapy cycles was noted for the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment also led to a significant reduction in the proportion of circulating regulatory T-cells (Treg; p = 0.0042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PBMC Tbx21 levels declined by 75% following each chemotherapy cycle despite administration of GM-CSF (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PBMC γ-interferon expression, however was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial confirms the suppressive effects of chemotherapy on Th1 cellular immunity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> but demonstrates that mid-cycle administration of GM-CSF can significantly increase the proportion of circulating dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As the role of dendritic cells in anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor immunity</z:e> becomes better defined, GM-CSF administration may provide a non-toxic intervention to augment this arm of the immune system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients receiving cytotoxic therapy </plain></SENT>
