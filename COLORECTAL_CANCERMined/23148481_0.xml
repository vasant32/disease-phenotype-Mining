<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lymphoid infiltration is a prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, such as colorectal, breast and <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, lymphoid infiltration is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and the reproducibility of quantification based on single counts within a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to develop a reproducible method for evaluating lymphoid infiltration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Virtual slides were obtained from tissue sections from the localized colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of 117 patients, stained for CD3 and CD45R0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the variation of lymphoid cell density by automatic counts in 1 mm-wide, 5 Î¼m-long segments of the invasive front, along an axis 4 mm in length running perpendicular to the invasive front of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We plotted curves of the variation of lymphocyte density across the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> front </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three distinct patterns emerged from this linear quantification of lymphocyte (LQLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In pattern 1, there was a high density of lymphocytes within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In pattern 2, lymphocyte density peaked close to the invasive margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In pattern 3, lymphocytes were diffusely distributed, at low density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was possible to classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> studied, and interobserver reproducibility was excellent (kappa =0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By contrast, single counts of CD3+ cells on tissue microarrays were highly variable for a given LQLI pattern, confirming the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of lymphoid infiltration within individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathologic features (stage, metastatic lymph node ratio (LNR), vascular embolism, perineural invasion), CD3+ cell density, LQLI patterns for CD3+ and CD45R0+ cells) were found to have a significant effect on disease-free survival (DFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only the LQLI pattern for CD3+ cells (HR: 6.02; 95% CI: 2.74-13.18) and metastatic lymph node ratio (HR: 6.14; 95% CI: 2.32-16.2) were associated with DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LQLI is an automated, reproducible method for the assessment of lymphoid infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, validation of its prognostic value in larger series is required before its introduction into routine practice for prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
