<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mining installations are releasing toxic substances into the environment which could pose a health problem to populations in their vicinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate whether there might be excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related mortality in populations residing in towns lying in the vicinity of Spanish mining industries governed by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register Regulation, according to the type of extraction method used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An ecologic study was designed to examine municipal mortality due to 32 types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, across the period 1997 through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Population exposure to pollution was estimated on the basis of distance from town of residence to pollution source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poisson regression models, using the Bayesian conditional autoregressive model proposed by Besag, York and Molli√® and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations for Bayesian inference, were used: to analyze risk of dying from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in a 5-kilometer zone around mining installations; effect of type of industrial activity; and to conduct individual analyses within a 50-kilometer radius of each installation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excess mortality (relative risk, 95% credible interval) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (1.097, 1.041-1.157), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (1.066, 1.009-1.126) specifically related with proximity to opencast coal mining, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> (1.106, 1.016-1.203) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (1.093, 1.003-1.191) related with other opencast mining installations, was detected among the overall population in the vicinity of mining installations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> also associated in the stratified analysis by type of mine, were: thyroid, gallbladder and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancers</z:hpo> (underground coal installations); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain cancer</z:e> (opencast coal mining); <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancer</z:hpo> (coal and other opencast mining installations); and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> (underground mining installations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggested an association between risk of dying due to digestive, respiratory, hematologic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancers</z:e> and proximity to Spanish mining industries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were dependent on the type of mine </plain></SENT>
