<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, elderly patients have received substandard <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment not supported by "evidence." Geriatric assessment should be performed preoperatively and selected elderly patients must be offered standard surgical treatment receiving the same complementary therapies as a younger patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It should be stressed that elderly patients should not be deprived of their decision-making role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our experience, more than 43% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are ≥70 years of age, and we believe that they should receive the same type of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This would allow for the detection and removal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>, and psychological support similarly to younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly, in our experience, the incidence of reoperation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> is similar in the two patient populations </plain></SENT>
