<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, recombinant <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi>-antitumor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (rAGAP), a protein consisting of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) linked with a hexa-histidine tag, was used as an antitumor <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the antitumor activity of rAGAP in human <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> SW480 cells and its potential molecular mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, cell viability and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of rAGAP-treated SW480 cells was evaluated by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay, flow cytometry and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi>) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting was used to investigate the effects of rAGAP on p27, Bcl-2/Bax and PTEN/PI3K/Akt cellular signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that rAGAP not only enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but also inhibited the proliferation of SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rAGAP upregulates the expression of p27 in SW480 cells and leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rAGAP significantly increases the production of Bax and PTEN and suppresses the activation of Bcl-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospho-Akt (p-Akt) in SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rAGAP may be a potential new anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> drug </plain></SENT>
