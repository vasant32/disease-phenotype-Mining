<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Serrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> (SP) is an infrequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) predisposition syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An unidentified genetic defect is believed to play a role in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of SP and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for first-degree relatives (FDRs) is not yet well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of both SP and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by studying the FDRs of our index SP cases and to propose an appropriate interval for colonoscopy surveillance in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2005 to December 2011, we prospectively included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from our hospital who fulfilled the SP diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We interviewed FDRs face to face and offered a colonoscopy to those who were 35 years old or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out with conventional and high-definition colonoscopes and chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine at the discretion of a single endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The samples were assessed by two pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the clinical data for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed previously in FDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2005, we collected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the new cases of SP and offered a colonoscopy to 95 FDRs of 34 pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We performed colonoscopies on 78 FDRs (82.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SP in the FDRs was 32% (25 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six percent of patients were diagnosed with SP as they had any number of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> proximal to the sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as a result of the screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>44.1% of our index cases had an FDR with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our series, which is the largest prospective cohort of FDRs published, reports an elevated incidence of SP in FDRs, thus supporting the need for screening colonoscopy in FDR and its inclusion in the guidelines </plain></SENT>
