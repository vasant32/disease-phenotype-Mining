<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: The mechanism, preclinical testing, and clinical activity of perifosine in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and MM are discussed, with supportive pharmacokinetic information presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Appropriate literature searches were carried out for background and discussion purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: In preclinical models, perifosine has been shown to target phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, preclinical studies indicate that perifosine may enhance the cytotoxic effects of fluorouracil, likely primarily through the nuclear transcription factor-kappa B pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A placebo-controlled Phase II randomized trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> Â± perifosine in previously treated patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> showed the combination to be superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In MM, Phase I/II clinical trials have established the optimal dosing schedule for perifosine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> in combination, and demonstrated that perifosine can sensitize to, or overcome resistance to, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>, associated with prolonged responses and a favorable side effect profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, the favorable tolerability of perifosine will allow for its testing in combination with multiple targeted therapies to improve PFS and OS, which represent an important unmet need in these populations </plain></SENT>
