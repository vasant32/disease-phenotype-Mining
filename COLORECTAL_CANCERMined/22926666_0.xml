<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is a risk factor for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle modifications, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, have been advocated to reduce the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no prospective study has evaluated whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> actually affects <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine whether weight change (loss or gain) over 4 years is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1826 patients with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyp</z:mpath> Prevention Trial had their height and weight measured at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence was determined by end of trial colonoscopy 4 years after study entry when patients' weights were re-measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poisson regression models were used to evaluate body mass index (BMI), weight change over 4 years, and the risk of any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence was observed in 723 patients (39.6%), 118 (6.5%) of whom had advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those with baseline BMI &lt; 25 kg/m² (n = 466), BMI 25-29 kg/m² (n = 868), and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² (n = 492), the recurrence rate was 34.5%, 41.0%, and 41.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence (RR = 1.19; 95%CI 1.01-1.39) and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence (RR = 1.62; 95%CI 1.01-2.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, when compared with those with relatively stable weight (weight change &lt; 5 lb) over the 4-year trial, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or loss was not associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was consistent, regardless of the baseline BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> or gain over 4 years does not affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study does not support <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> alone as an effective intervention for reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
