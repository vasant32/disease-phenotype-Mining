<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was expanded to focus on patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received oral regorafenib 60-220 mg daily (160 mg daily in the extension cohort) in cycles of 21 days on, 7 days off treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessments included toxicity, response, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients with heavily pretreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (median 4 prior lines of therapy, range 0-7) were enrolled in the dose-escalation and extension phases; 26 patients received regorafenib 160 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median treatment duration was 53 days (range 7-280 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common treatment-related toxicities included hand-foot skin reaction, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, voice change and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients were evaluable for response: 1 achieved partial response and 19 had stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 107 days (95% CI, 66-161) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At steady state, regorafenib and its active metabolites had similar systemic exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pharmacodynamic assessment indicated decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> perfusion in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regorafenib showed tolerability and antitumour activity in patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This expanded-cohort phase I study provided the foundation for further clinical trials of regorafenib in this patient population </plain></SENT>
