<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that CTNNB1 activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> modifies prognostic associations of body mass index (BMI) and level of postdiagnosis physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Two US prospective cohort studies (Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study) were used to evaluate CTNNB1 localization by immunohistochemistry in 955 patients with stage I, II, III, or IV colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> from 1980 through 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality, adjusting for clinical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, level of long interspersed nucleotide element 1 methylation, mutations in KRAS, BRAF, or PIK3CA, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> protein p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific mortality and overall mortality through June 30, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (BMI ≥30), positive status for nuclear CTNNB1 was associated with significantly better <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival (adjusted HR, 0.24 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.12-0.49], P &lt;.001 for interaction; 5-year survival: 0.85 for patients with positive nuclear CTNNB1 status vs 0.78 for those with negative status) and overall survival (adjusted HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.35-0.90], P = .03 for interaction; 5-year survival: 0.77 for patients with positive nuclear CTNNB1 status vs 0.74 for those with negative status), while CTNNB1 status was not associated with prognosis among nonobese patients (BMI &lt;30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with negative status for nuclear CTNNB1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in stages I, II, or III, postdiagnosis physical activity was associated with better <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival (adjusted HR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13-0.81], P = .05 for interaction; 5-year survival: 0.97 for ≥18 vs 0.89 for &lt;18 metabolic equivalent task hours/week), while postdiagnosis physical activity was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival among patients with positive status for nuclear CTNNB1 (adjusted HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.50-2.30]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients only, activation of CTNNB1 was associated with better <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These molecular pathological epidemiology findings suggest that the effects of alterations in the WNT-CTNNB1 pathway on outcome are modified by BMI and physical activity </plain></SENT>
