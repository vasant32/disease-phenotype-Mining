<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although early detection through screening has been shown to be effective in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality, adherence to screening guidelines remains low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among certain populations--namely those with lower socioeconomic status, a greater number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions or multiple morbidity, and those living in rural locations-- <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening is particularly underused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study explored the prevalence of such screening and explanations for how multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions might affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among an especially vulnerable group of middle-aged and older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 41 participants were recruited aged 50-76 years with two or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions, from three rural health clinics in Appalachian Kentucky, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using semi-structured and structured questions and instruments, participants engaged in two interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Study results demonstrate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates lower than state and national averages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to commonly expressed barriers including unpleasant screening modality, lack of health insurance, and shortage of gastroenterologists to perform colonoscopy, participants described the ways in which multiple morbidities undermine screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Barriers specific to multiple morbidity include competing demands from other conditions, such as financial pressures, physical limitations, and worries over regimen interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The window of opportunity left open by more frequent visits to health care professionals should be used to patients' advantage, especially as people with multiple morbidity are living longer with their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Efforts must accelerate to establish clinical guidelines and practices incorporating both management of existing conditions and the prevention of additional future morbidity </plain></SENT>
