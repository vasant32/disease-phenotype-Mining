<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) follow-up care in Nova Scotia, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More specifically, the objectives were to describe adherence to two elements of follow-up guidelines (colonoscopies and physician visits) and to identify factors associated with receiving at least guideline-recommended care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> undergoing curative-intent surgery in Nova Scotia, Canada, were identified through the provincial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry and anonymously linked to additional administrative health databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For a 3-year follow-up period, beginning 1 year after the diagnosis date, descriptive statistics were calculated for physician visits and colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with receiving at least guideline-recommended care were identified using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most patients received follow-up care from multiple physician specialties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In year 3, 58.1% of patients received oncologist follow-up care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Guideline adherence for colonoscopies was 52.4%, whereas guideline adherence for physician visits decreased from 41.9% to 25.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Receipt of at least guideline-recommended care was inversely associated with age and comorbidity for colonoscopy and inversely associated with age for physician visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Receipt of follow-up care from oncologists and primary care physicians, prolonged oncologist care, and receipt of care inconsistent with guideline recommendations suggest there may be potential issues with inefficient use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> system resources and integration of guidelines into follow-up care practices in Nova Scotia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transitioning routine follow-up to primary care could potentially increase guideline adherence by improving access to and continuity of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may be well suited to targeted knowledge translation strategies to improve guideline adherence </plain></SENT>
