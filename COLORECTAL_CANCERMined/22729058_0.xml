<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VDR gene with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in age and gender matched patients and controls of European origin in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (N=200) and healthy control (N=200) samples were genotyped for the Fok1 (rs2228570), Taq1 (rs731236) and Cdx2 (rs11568820) polymorphisms using TaqmanÂ® SNP genotyping assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chi-squared analysis was used to test for overall association of VDR genotype with disease, and by age and gender subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant associations of the three VDR SNPs with disease either by allelic frequencies (p=0.43-0.73) or genotypic distribution (p=0.15-0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no significant differences for allelic frequencies of the three SNPs were revealed in subgroup analysis by age (above/below median age of 72 yrs; p=0.38-0.91), gender (p=0.22-0.88), or age/gender (p=0.33-0.93) CONCLUSION: We found no evidence to suggest that the VDR SNPs Fok1, Taq1 and Cdx2 influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in New Zealand Europeans </plain></SENT>
