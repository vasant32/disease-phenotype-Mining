<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the effects of perioperative administration of probiotics on the gut barrier function and the surgical outcome in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were randomly divided into the control group (n = 50) and the probiotics group (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probiotics were given orally for 6 days preoperatively and 10 days post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were measured by <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> translocation, gut permeability, the effect on the faecal microbiota, and the clinical outcomes such as infectious-related complications and gut defecation function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, probiotics group had increased transepithelial resistance (P &lt; 0.05), reduced transmucosal permeation of horseradish peroxidase and lactulose/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> ratio, reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> translocation (P &lt; 0.05), decreased ileal-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> binding protein (P &lt; 0.05) and positive rate of blood <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> DNA (P &lt; 0.05) and an enhanced mucosal tight junction protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They had decreased blood enteropathogenic bacteria and increased faecal <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> variety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The post-operative recovery of peristalsis, incidence of diarrhoea, and infectious-related complications were also improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Probiotics can improve the integrity of gut mucosal barrier by benefiting the faecal microbiota, and decreasing infectious complications in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergoing colorectomy </plain></SENT>
