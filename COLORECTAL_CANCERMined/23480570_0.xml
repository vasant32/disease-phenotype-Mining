<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These data were complemented by in-depth interviews exploring opportunities and barriers to giving lifestyle advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 323 replies were received (42% response rate) and twenty respondents completed in-depth interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half (52%) reported they were familiar with guidance for lifestyle advice for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most (77%) thought reducing weight was important for improving the health of those who were overweight and 75% thought it appropriate to offer lifestyle advice to people with body mass index (BMI) over 30kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Half (50%) reported that weight reduction was an important service priority for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clinical practice Half (50%) of respondents said that they would value additional training in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interview data revealed that current practice is influenced by the lack of evidence for the impact of weight management, and a belief that "<z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> is good and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> bad" in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient sensitivity, time available, role constraints and lack of skills in weight management were also factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is an awareness of the importance of weight management amongst colorectal clinicians and some indication of advice being provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, current perceptions, knowledge and skills suggest scope for further training. © 2013 The Authors </plain></SENT>
