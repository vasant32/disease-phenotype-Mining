<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite progress in elucidating mechanisms associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and improvement of treatment methods, it remains a frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New and more effective therapies are therefore urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that immunogenicity of whole <z:mp ids='MP_0008000'>ovarian tumor</z:mp> cells and subsequent T cell response were potentiated by oxidation modification with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">hypochlorous acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi>) in vitro and ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results prompted us to investigate the protective antitumor response with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> treated CT26 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell vaccine in an in vivo mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> modified vaccine triggered robust antitumor immunity to autologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in mice and prolonged survival period significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue from the oxidation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, ELISPOT assays showed that specific T cell responses were not elicited in response to the immunizing cellular antigen, in contrast to raising sera antibody titer and antibody binding activity shown by ELISA assay and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of the mechanisms underlying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> modified vaccine mediated humoral immunity highlighted the role of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results combined with previous studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> oxidation modified whole cell vaccine has wide applicability as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vaccine because it can target both T cell- and B cell-specific responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may thus represent a promising approach for the immunotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
