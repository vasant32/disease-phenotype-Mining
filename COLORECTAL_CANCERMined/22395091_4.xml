<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to search for potential diagnostic biomarkers in the serum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is the third most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> worldwide, and its prognosis is poor at early stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A panel of novel biomarkers is urgently needed for early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An integrated proteomics and metabolomics approach was performed to define oncofetal biomarkers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by protein and metabolite profiling of serum samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, healthy control adults, and fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differentially expressed proteins were identified by a 2-D DIGE (2-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis) coupled with a Finnigan LTQ-based proteomics approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the serum metabolome was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry integrated with a commercial mass spectral library for peak identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 28 identified proteins and the 34 analyzed metabolites, only 5 protein spots and 6 metabolites were significantly increased or decreased in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and fetal serum groups compared with the healthy adult group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data from supervised predictive models allowed a separation of 93.5% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from the healthy controls using the 6 metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, correlation analysis was applied to establish quantitative linkages between the 5 individual metabolite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20067">3-hydroxybutyric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16414,30015">L-valine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16857,30013">L-threonine</z:chebi>, 1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi>, and glycine and the 5 individual proteins MACF1, APOH, A2M, IGL@, and VDB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 10 potential oncofetal biomarkers were characterized and their potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis was validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The integrated approach we developed will promote the translation of biomarkers with clinical value into routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
