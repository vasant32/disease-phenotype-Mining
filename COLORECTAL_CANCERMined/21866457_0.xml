<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinicopathological and follow-up data of 93 patients with obstructing left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergoing surgical treatment from January 2001 to December 2006 in the Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Qingdao University were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 53 males and 40 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 61 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients had concurrent medical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radical resection was performed in 67 patients, including one-stage resection (n=21), Hartmann procedure (n=35), and Miles procedure (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery was palliative in 26 patients, including diverting stoma (n=14), bypass surgery (n=7), and palliative resection (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 93 patients were followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 94%, 59%, and 38%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that radical resection, TNM staging, and preoperative level of carcinoembryonic antigen were independent prognostic factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radical resection, TNM stage, and preoperative CEA level are prognostic factors of obstructing left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis, radical resection, and selection of appropriate surgical procedure are helpful to prolong survival time of patients with obstructing left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
