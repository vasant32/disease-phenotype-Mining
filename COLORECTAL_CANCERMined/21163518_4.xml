<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved methods of detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> during colonoscopy could significantly improve mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report a high-performance nanoparticle for photodynamic detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, where alginate is physically complexed with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>-modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> to form nanoparticles with improved drug release in the cellular lysosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incorporated alginate molecules could complex stably with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> via electrostatic attraction, and the z-average diameter and zeta-potential of the prepared nanoparticles (fCAN) was 115 nm and 22 mV, respectively, enough to keep the nanoparticles stable in aqueous suspension without aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When loaded with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">5-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> (5-ALA; 27% loading efficiency), the nanoparticles (fCANA) displayed no differences in particle size or zeta-potential compared to fCAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the fCANA nanoparticles were readily taken up by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells via <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> receptor-mediated endocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the loaded 5-ALA was release in the lysosome, and this was promoted by the reduced attraction intensity between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> and 5-ALA via the deprotonated alginate, resulting in a higher intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> accumulation for the photodynamic detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that the alginate incorporated and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>-conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> nanoparticles are excellent vectors for colorectal-specific delivery of 5-ALA for fluorescent endoscopic detection </plain></SENT>
