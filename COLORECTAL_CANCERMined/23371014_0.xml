<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no data on adherence to guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening in patients with a family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: We conducted a retrospective study to assess if such patients were being appropriately screened according to American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two independent reviewers performed a comprehensive medical record review of family and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening history on 362 adults with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a first-degree relative who had recently undergone screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endpoint was appropriate initiation of screening and endoscopist-recommended subsequent screening intervals, as compared to AGA guideline recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 362 subjects, only 146 (40.3 %) were screened appropriately; 213 (58.9 %) had late initiation of screening (i.e., screening was started ≥5 years later than the age recommended by guidelines) and three (0.8 %) had premature initiation (i.e., screening was started ≥1 year too early) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of cases involving delayed screening initiation, 126 were not under primary care at the time when screening was supposed to have started, while most of the remaining received either no or incorrect screening recommendations from their primary care provider </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 270 subjects with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> found on initial screening, 112 (41.5 %) had endoscopist-recommended subsequent screening intervals that were ≥2 years shorter than that recommended by guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were similar if American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy or American College of Gastroenterology guidelines were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a family history often suffer from late initiation of screening and overly short endoscopist-recommended subsequent intervals for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further education of patients and providers on screening recommendations may be helpful </plain></SENT>
