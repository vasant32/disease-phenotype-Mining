<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During the multiyear progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, numerous genomic alterations arise in events ranging from single base mutations to gains or losses of entire chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single genetic change might not stand out as an independent predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine if more comprehensive measurements of genomic instability provide clinically relevant prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study included 65 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients diagnosed from 1987 to 1991 with last follow-up ascertained in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We estimated an overall tally of alterations using the genome-wide sampling technique of inter-(simple sequence repeat [SSR]) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and evaluated its relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also extended and sensitized the Bethesda criteria for microsatellite instability (MSI), by analyzing 348 microsatellite markers instead of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We expanded the MSI categories into four levels: MSI stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>), very low-level MSI, moderately low-level MSI, and classical high-level MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> with genomic instability above the median value of 2.6% as measured by inter-SSR PCR, were associated with far greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with lower levels of genomic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcome was most pronounced for patients presenting with stage 3 disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A gradient of increased survival was observed across increasing MSI levels but did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest genomic instabilities quantified by inter-SSR PCR and increased precision in MSI values may be clinically useful tools for estimating prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
