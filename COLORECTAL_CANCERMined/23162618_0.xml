<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been identified that ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters are associated with chemoresistance, which is a major obstacle in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to investigate the association of pretherapeutic multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) expression with response to chemotherapy in stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein expression was determined by immunohistochemical analysis of 50 archival samples from patients who had not received preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin (FL) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX-4) regimen for 6 months following curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 12 months of follow-up, local and distant recurrences were observed in 15 (30%) cases, of which 5 occurred at the time of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRP2 expression was observed in 24 (48%) and 7 (14%) cases in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was observed between the positive expression frequency in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues compared to the surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of recurrence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> for patients in the MRP2-positive group was lower than that in the MRP2-negative group (P&gt;0.05); however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 cases who demonstrated recurrence during their treatment were MRP2-positive (P=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRP2 expression was not correlated with the clinicopathological markers in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that MRP2 expression was not associated with a shorter disease-free survival or overall survival of patients (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicated that MRP2 is overexpressed in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, expression of MRP2 was not associated with recurrence of patients treated with FL and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in the population studied </plain></SENT>
