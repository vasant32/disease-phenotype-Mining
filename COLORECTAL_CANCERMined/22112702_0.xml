<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this paper were to highlight the inequities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in South Australia (SA) and the system-related barriers and enablers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening from the perspective of participants identified as having inequitable participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, de-identified data for the SA population of the NBCSP were statistically analysed and then mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, 117 in-depth interviews were conducted with culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) groups, Indigenous and Anglo-Saxon Australians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participation rates in the NBCSP were geographically and statistically significantly different (P &lt; 0.0001) on the basis of gender (higher for women), age (higher for older people) and socioeconomic status (higher for more affluent people) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main system-related barriers were the lack of awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening within these groups, the problems with language due to most of the information being in English and the lack of recommendation by a doctor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study revealed that inequity exists in the NBCSP participation in SA, and we identified both barriers and facilitators to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening that require action at the level of both policy and practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is a large role in primary health care of both recommending <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and facilitating equitable participation </plain></SENT>
