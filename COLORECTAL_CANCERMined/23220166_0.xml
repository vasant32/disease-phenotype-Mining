<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of geographic factors on adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and differences in screening use among familial risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2010 Utah Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System, which included state-added questions on familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using multiple logistic regression models, we assessed the effects of rural vs urban residence, travel time to the nearest colonoscopy provider, and spatial accessibility of providers on adherence to risk-appropriate screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study participants (n = 4260) were respondents aged 50 to 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of the sample adhered to risk-appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines, with significant differences between urban and rural residents (68% vs 57%, respectively; P &lt; .001) across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> familial risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rural residents were less likely than urban dwellers to be up-to-date with screening guidelines (multivariate odds ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the unadjusted analysis, rural vs urban residence (P &lt; .001), travel time to the nearest colonoscopy provider (P = .003), and spatial accessibility of providers (P = .012) were associated significantly with adherence to screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, rural vs urban residence (P &lt; .001) was the only geographic variable independently associated with screening adherence in the adjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are marked disparities in use of risk-appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening between rural and urban residents in Utah </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences in travel time to the nearest colonoscopy provider and spatial accessibility of providers did not account for the geographic variations observed in screening adherence </plain></SENT>
