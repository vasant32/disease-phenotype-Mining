<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> HT-29, Colo 320DM, SW480 and LoVo cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4775">ellagic acid</z:chebi> (2.5-25 μg/ml) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-25 μM) alone and in combination and then the viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by annexin-V labeling, mitochondria membrane potential by staining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi>, and changes in the levels of proteins involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
