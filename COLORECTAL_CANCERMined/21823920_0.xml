<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed 392 published articles, involving a total of 5.2 million participants, cited as references in five influential clinical guidelines addressing the use of antiarrhythmics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each article, we extracted the number of female participants to determine any discrepancies in the sex of participants and if the proportion of female participants as research subjects reflected the sex distribution of patients affected by the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall and median percentages (per study) of females per guideline were: use of antiarrhythmics (35%, median 38%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (70%, median 73%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (67%, median 46%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (66%, median 66%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (63%, median 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The baseline prevalence rates used for comparison purposes were (percentage female): antiarrhythmics (60% of patients 75(+) years); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (66%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (46%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (66%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> guidelines were based on research populations that accurately reflected the sex distribution of the condition in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women were slightly overrepresented in the research studies supporting the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> guidelines and were significantly underrepresented in the research studies supporting the guidelines on the use of antiarrhythmics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Guideline developers should be aware of and comment on the potential impact of sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Where the evidence base is lacking, guideline developers should highlight this and, where necessary, limit their specific conclusions to populations on whom the research was performed </plain></SENT>
