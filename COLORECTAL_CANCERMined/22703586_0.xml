<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the miRNA-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> regulatory network is far from being fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to identify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) specific miRNAs and their target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> using a multi-step approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A multi-step approach combining microarray miRNA and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression profile and bioinformatics analysis was adopted to identify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specific miRNA-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> regulatory network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, 32 differentially expressed miRNAs and 2916 mRNAs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples and their corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelial tissues were identified by miRNA and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> microarray, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondly, 22 dysregulated miRNAs and their 58 target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> (72 miRNA-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> pairs) were identified by a combination of Pearson's correlation analysis and prediction by databases TargetScan and miRanda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these miRNA-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> pairs were involved in Wnt signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 6 up-regulated miRNAs (mir-21, mir-223, mir-224, mir-29a, mir-29b, and mir-27a) and 4 down-regulated predicted target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> (SFRP1, SFRP2, RNF138, and KLF4) were selected to validate the expression level and their anti-correlationship in an extended cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients by qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except for mir-27a, the differential expression and their anti-correlationship were proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, a transfection assay was performed to validate a regulatory relationship between mir-29a and KLF4 at both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-two miRNA-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> pairs combined by 22 dysregulated miRNAs and their 58 target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> identified by the multi-step approach appear to be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results in our study were worthwhile to further investigation via a functional study to fully understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms of miRNA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
