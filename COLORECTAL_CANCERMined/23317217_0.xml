<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to examine the level of auto-antibodies against survivin and MUC1 VNTR in the serum of 135 CRC patients and 95 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using mean absorbance+2 standard deviations (SD) of the healthy samples as a cut-off value, the positive rates of survivin and MUC1 VNTR auto- antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 31.1% and 18.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the survivin and MUC1 VNTR positive samples accounted for 36.3% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and 7.4% were positive for both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significant positive correlation was found between levels of specific antibodies against survivin and MUC1 VNTR in the serum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (r=0.3652, P&lt;0.0001), suggesting that vaccines against both targets would elicit immune responses more effectively </plain></SENT>
