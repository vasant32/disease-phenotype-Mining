<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the effect of common components of primary care-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening interventions on fecal occult blood test (FOBT) completion within rural and urban community clinics, including: (1) physician's spoken recommendation, (2) providing information or education about FOBTs, and (3) physician providing the FOBT kit; to determine the relative effect of these interventions; and to compare the effect of each intervention between rural and urban clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted structured interviews with patients aged 50 years and over receiving care at community clinics that were noncompliant with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Self-report of ever receiving a physician's recommendation for screening, FOBT information or education, physician providing an FOBT kit, and FOBT completion were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Participants included 849 screening-eligible adults; 77% were female and 68% were African American </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 57; 33% lacked a high school diploma and 51% had low literacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> services were predictive of rural participants completing screening (physician recommendation: P = .002; FOBT education: P = .001; physician giving FOBT kit: P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In urban clinics, only physician giving the kit predicted FOBT completion (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to urban patients, rural patients showed a stronger relationship between FOBT completion and receiving a physician recommendation (risk ratio [RR]: 5.3 vs. 2.1; P = .0001), receiving information or education on FOBTs (RR: 3.8 vs 1.9; P = .0002), or receiving an FOBT kit from their physician (RR: 22.3 vs. 10.1; P = .035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participants who receive an FOBT kit from their physician are more likely to complete screening </plain></SENT>
