<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether these loci affect clinical outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we genotyped 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 GWAS-identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility regions and evaluated their associations with survival and recurrence in 285 stage II and III patients receiving fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one SNP, rs10318 (15q13.3), was significantly associated with recurrence for patients with stage II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three SNPs: rs10749971 (11q23.1), rs961253 (20p12.3) and rs355527 (20p12.3) in two regions were significantly associated with recurrence for patients with stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five SNPs: rs961253 (20p12.3), rs355527 (20p12.3), rs4464148 (18q21.1), rs6983267 (8q24.21) and rs10505477 (8q24.21) in three regions were significantly associated with survival for patients with stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative effects of multiple unfavorable genotypes were observed for recurrence and survival in patients with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility loci may also affect the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients receiving fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
