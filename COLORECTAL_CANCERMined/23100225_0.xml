<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of this family, PPARδ has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, whereas its exact role is highly controversial as available studies yield conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further studies using powerful and duplicable methods are needed to clarify the functions of PPARδ in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of available RNAi methods, lentivirus has been shown to mediate RNAi most efficiently and stably based on its remarkable advantages, such as powerful transduction efficiency and a wider range of target cells, integration of expression cassette into host genomics, low immunogenicity and self-inactivated and replication-incompetent after integrating into host genomics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this chapter, we will introduce the details of using lentivirus-mediated RNAi to specifically knockdown the expression of PPARδ in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method includes: designing and cloning short-hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> cassette into lentivector, constructing and titrating lentiviral particles, infecting target cells with lentivirus and assaying the knockdown efficiency </plain></SENT>
