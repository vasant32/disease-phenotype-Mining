<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Along with advances in the chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> has been changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most striking issues is that initially unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> can be resectable after chemotherapy with considerably high frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, advanced chemotherapy leads to the downsizing of the metastatic foci in the liver, which is sometimes difficult to detect with conventional intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To discover the undetectable hepatic lesions with IOUS, we have introduced contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasonography (CEIOUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we present evidence that viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells exist in even the shrunken <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with high frequency and that CEIOUS contributes to detecting the minute foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was composed of eight patients; four of them had initially unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and the remaining four had either H2 or H3 status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them underwent hepatic resection after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 57 metastatic lesions were detected before chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty lesions were demonstrated by CEIOUS with perflubutane and resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the pathological examination, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were not found in 12 of the 30 resected lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The degree of pathological liver damage was grade 1 or less in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and no serious complication occurred after surgery in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study showed that viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells remained with high frequency, even in the minute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> which was reduced in size after chemotherapy, and CEIOUS was a useful examination for detecting the minute hepatic foci </plain></SENT>
