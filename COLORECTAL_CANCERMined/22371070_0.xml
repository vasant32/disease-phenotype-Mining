<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the frequency of MUTYH and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Arabs, North African and European Jews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 593 Sephardi Moroccan Jews (232 cases, 361 controls) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 631 Arabs (327 cases, 304 controls) recruited into a population-based study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Israel, as well as a random sample of 189 Ashkenazi Jewish cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two MUTYH mutations, G396D and Y179C, were studied in 1,413 individuals, with MUTYH sequence analysis in 46 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a sibling or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No carriers of mutations in MUTYH were identified in Ashkenazi Jews and only one in Arabs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Sephardi Jews, 28 carriers of G396D, 25 (4.2%) heterozygotes and 3 (0.5%) homozygotes were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four (0.7%) were heterozygote carriers of the Y179C mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two compound heterozygous carriers of Y179C and G396D were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Homozygote carriers of G396D had nonsignificantly elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 11.0, 95% CI: 0.91-213.9, p = 0.06), and combined bi-allelic carriers of G396D and Y179C had increased risk, OR = 17.4, 95% CI = (1.9-316.7, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MUTYH carriers of the common mutations is much higher in Sephardi Jews </plain></SENT>
