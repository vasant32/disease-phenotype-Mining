<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims at investigating whether there are changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers and/or in nutritional status of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergoing chemotherapy who were supplemented with fish oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical trial was conducted with 23 patients randomly distributed in 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The supplemented group (SG) consumed 2 g of fish oil containing 600 milligrams of eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) for 9 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nutritional and inflammatory markers status was available, both at a baseline (M0), and after 9 wk of chemotherapy (M9) in the SG and in the nonsupplemented group (NSG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was conducted with STATA 11.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SG and NSG presented the same baseline characteristics (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nutritional status indicators such as body mass index and body weight were modified only in the NSG when comparing baseline and M9, P = 0.03 and P = 0.01 respectively, whereas in SG these indicators did not vary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients supplemented with fish oil (SG) showed a clinically relevant decrease in the C-reactive protein/albumin relation (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low doses of fish oil supplement can positively modulate the nutritional status and the C-reative protein/albumin ratio </plain></SENT>
