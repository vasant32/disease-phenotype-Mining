<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between the expression levels and promoter DNA methylation status of RGMa and the clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the expression of RGMa by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and western blotting and analyzed the methylation status of the RGMa promoter using Sequenom's MassARRAY platform in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that RGMa expression was decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues compared with adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a tendency for decreased expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues was observed from Dukes' stage A to stage D (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, significantly higher levels of hypermethylation in promoter regions of RGMa were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues, compared with those in adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the methylation levels of RGMa in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues were significantly increased in Dukes' stage C and D compared with Dukes' stage A and B (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that RGMa expression and promoter methylation status are closely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> genesis and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Determination of the expression level and methylation frequency of RGMa in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues may have benefit for early diagnosis and for evaluating patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
