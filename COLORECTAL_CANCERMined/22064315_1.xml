<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Qualitative study comprising 4 purposively sampled focus groups conducted in urban and rural areas in Tayside, Scotland, with different deprivation levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were men and women (n=17) aged 50-74 with BMI&gt;25 kg/m(2) with removal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> diagnosis presents both opportunities and challenges for prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some patients perceived <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> as minor and not sufficiently motivating to act as a 'teachable moment' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients had low awareness of the relationship between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and lifestyle factors, and received little information on prevention during screening and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently they interpreted post-treatment '<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clear' messages as validation of existing lifestyles, and did not see the relevance of prevention advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receptiveness increased when the association between lifestyle, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence and other illness was explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study illustrates the value of exploratory research into patient understanding to improve communications and health services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Without unduly worrying patients, professionals should explain how to reduce risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and other diseases, particularly through diet, physical activity and weight reduction </plain></SENT>
