<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 146 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at our hospital were collected prospectively and followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 84 males and 62 females with an average age of (61 ± 11) years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue microarray was prepared and the expression of Notch signal genes were detected by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The differential expressions of Hes1 were significant among various types [negative or weakly positive: 8% (12/146), positive(+): 77% (112/146), positive(++): 15% (22/146)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 134 were followed up successfully for an average duration of (42 ± 13) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the Kaplan-Meier life curve, the overall 1, 3 and 5-year survival rates were 93% (136/146), 74% (108/146) and 67% (98/146) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The long-term survival rate was correlated with TNM stage and pathological types (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P = 0.000), but not with Hes1 (P = 0.267) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of Hes1 is correlated with pathological types and differentiation types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However the long-term survival rate is not correlated with its expression </plain></SENT>
