<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that fibronectin alternative extra domain A (EDA) facilitates lymphangiogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since it is known that EDA interacts with integrin α9 in the lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), we hypothesized that endostatin may target EDA-integrin α9 pathway to inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e>-induced lymphangiogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of endostatin on EDA secreted by SW480 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and treated human LECs with different doses of endostatin in the presence of conditional medium from SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that endostatin significantly reduced EDA secretion by SW480 cells and the expression of integrin α9 in LECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies showed that EDA and integrin α9 colocalized on the cell membrane of LECs and these colocalizations were dramatically reduced by endostatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that EDA interacted with integrin α9 in LECs, and showed that endostatin treatment inhibited the formation of EDA-integrin α9 complex in LECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the arrangement and polarity of LEC cytoskeletons were destroyed by endostatin substantially, leading to a reduced formation of tube-like structures of LECs and a suppressed chemotaxis of LECs toward SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistently, EDA and integrin α9 expressions as well as lymphangiogenesis were significantly suppressed by endostatin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that endostatin reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e>-induced lymphangiogenesis, at least in part, by inhibiting EDA-integrin α9 pathway </plain></SENT>
