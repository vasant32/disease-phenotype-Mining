<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics of 5-FU and its inactive metabolite 5-fluoro-5,6-dihydrouracil (5-FDHU) were measured on days 1 and 5 of the first chemotherapy cycle, 5 and 45 minutes after bolus administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5-FU clearance was significantly lower on day 5 (62.64 ± 20.16 L/h/m(2)) than on day 1 (74.83 ± 31.61 L/h/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lower 5-FU clearance values also predicted the side effects during the entire course of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, patients with low clearance values on day 1 had a further reduction in this parameter on day 5, associated with severe toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 5-FU alters its clearance, which could be partly due to a reduction in 5-FDHU biotransformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings have safety implications for poor metabolizers whose drug clearance may fall below the threshold during repeated treatment cycles </plain></SENT>
