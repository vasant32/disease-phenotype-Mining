<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 121 patients irradiated for MSCC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven potential prognostic factors were investigated including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type, age, gender, Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status score (ECOG-PS), number of involved vertebrae, ambulatory status prior to radiotherapy (RT), other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastases</z:e>, visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, interval from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis to RT of MSCC, time of developing motor deficits prior to RT, and the RT schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, improved motor function was significantly associated with an ECOG-PS of 1-2 (p = 0.011) and a slower development of motor deficits (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Improved local control was significantly associated with absence of visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (p = 0.043) and longer-course RT (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improved survival was significantly associated with an ECOG-PS of 1-2 (p &lt; 0.001), ambulatory status (p &lt; 0.001), absence of visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001), and a slower development of motor deficits (p = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These four prognostic factors were included in a survival score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The score for each factor was determined by dividing the 6-month survival rate by 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognostic score represented the sum of the factor scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four prognostic groups were designed; the 6-month survival rates were 0% for 8-12 points, 26% for 13-18 points, 62% for 20-23 points, and 100% for 24-27 points (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study identified several independent prognostic factors for treatment outcomes in patients irradiated for MSCC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The survival prognosis of these patients can be estimated with a new score </plain></SENT>
