<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of continued smoking after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis is understudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the multi-regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance cohort (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> [N = 2456], <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> [N = 3063]), the authors examined smoking rates at diagnosis and 5 months after diagnosis and also study factors associated with continued smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 90.2% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and 54.8% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> reported ever smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, 38.7% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and 13.7% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were smoking; whereas, 5 months after diagnosis, 14.2% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and 9.0% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors that were associated independently with continued smoking among patients with nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> were coverage by Medicare, other public/unspecified insurance, not receiving chemotherapy, not undergoing surgery, prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, lower body mass index, lower emotional support, and higher daily ever-smoking rates (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors that were associated independently with continued smoking among patients with nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were male sex, high school education, being uninsured, not undergoing surgery, and higher daily ever-smoking rates (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After diagnosis, a substantial minority of patients with lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> continued smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> had higher rates of smoking at diagnosis and after diagnosis; whereas patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were less likely to quit smoking after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors that were associated with continued smoking differed between lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future smoking-cessation efforts should examine differences by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type, particularly when comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> for which smoking is a well established risk factor versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> for which it is not </plain></SENT>
