<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with an expired order for screening colonoscopy might be persuaded to follow through with screening by such an intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a combined reminder/outreach intervention among patients in a large general internal medicine practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants included 628 patients aged 50 to 79 years with an expired order for screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified based on receipt of any previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and randomly assigned either to (1) an intervention group that received a mailing containing a reminder letter from their primary care physician, a brochure and digital video disc about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, and a follow-up telephone call or (2) a usual care control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was receipt of fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy within 3 months of randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening outcomes were observed for an additional 3 months (6 months from randomization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Screening rates at 3 months were 9.9% (31 of 314 patients) in the intervention group and 3.2% (10 of 314 patients) in the control group (rate ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.2; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, rates were 18.2% (57 of 314 patients) and 12.1% (38 of 314 patients), respectively (rate ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.2; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patient outreach to individuals with an expired order for colonoscopy may be an effective tool to modestly increase short-term completion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
