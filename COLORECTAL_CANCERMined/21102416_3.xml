<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP+), in which discrete genes throughout the genome are simultaneously methylated, and long-range epigenetic silencing, whereby multiple genes within contiguous chromosomal regions are methylated, have been described in subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported the concurrent methylation of the mismatch repair gene MLH1 with a cluster of flanking genes in chromosome region 3p22 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> exhibiting microsatellite instability and the BRAF V600E mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we aimed to determine whether methylation of MLH1 and neighbouring 3p22 genes, singly or concomitantly, correlate with the germline c.-93G&gt;A SNP within the MLH1 promoter, CIMP+ and other clinicopathological and molecular features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By studying a cohort of 946 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases, we show a strong association between concordant methylation of â‰¥ 3 of five 3p22 genes with CIMP+ and the BRAF V600E mutation (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of microsatellite instability, as concomitant methylation of 3p22 genes other than MLH1 was found in microsatellite stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings show that long-range epigenetic silencing across 3p22 occurs in the context of CIMP+ and the BRAF V600E mutation, and only gives rise to microsatellite instability when this process encompasses MLH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the strong relationship between long-range epigenetic silencing of 3p22 and CIMP+ provides further evidence that these two purportedly distinct epigenetic phenotypes represent a single entity with a common aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-level methylation of MLH1 and flanking 3p22 genes, as well as the BRAF V600E mutation, were detected in the apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa of a small number of cases whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> showed a similar molecular profile, suggesting that these concurring genetic and epigenetic events can occur as a field defect in neoplastic development </plain></SENT>
