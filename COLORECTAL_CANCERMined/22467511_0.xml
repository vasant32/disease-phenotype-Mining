<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among the 19,451 new cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recorded in the Burgundy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancer</z:e> registry between 1976 and 2008, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of IBD-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates were age-standardized according to the world standard population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was determined using univariate and multivariate relative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight IBD-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, n = 29; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis was greater for patients without IBD than those with IBD (70.9 vs. 56.9 years, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall world age-standardized incidence of IBD-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> per 100,000 was 0.11 (standard deviation [SD]: 0.03) for men and 0.06 (SD: 0.02) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only age was independently associated with IBD-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (odds ratio [OR]: 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12-0.43; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities did not differ between IBD and non-IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five-year relative survival was 51.9% (95% CI: 51.1-52.8%) in non-IBD patients and 41.3% (95% CI: 24.6-57.2%) in IBD patients (P = 0.201) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, gender, and stage at diagnosis, the excess hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 1.46 times higher in IBD than in non-IBD patients (95% CI: 0.94-2.27; P = 0.070) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Apart from age, the characteristics of IBD-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were similar to those of non-IBD <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may be poorer in patients with IBD than in those without IBD </plain></SENT>
