<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how well Canadian gastroenterologists adhere to colonoscopy surveillance guidelines after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> removal or treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who had surveillance performed between October 2008 and October 2010 were retrospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time intervals between index colonoscopy and surveillance were compared with the 2008 guideline recommendations of the American Gastroenterological Association and regarded as appropriate when the surveillance interval was within six months of the recommended time interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 265 patients were included (52% men; mean age 58 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> index colonoscopy (n=110), 42% received surveillance on time, 38% too early (median difference = 1.2 years too early) and 20% too late (median difference = 1.0 year too late) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with nonadvanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at index (n=96), 25% underwent surveillance on time, 61% too early (median difference = 1.85) and 14% too late (median difference = 1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> at index (n=59), 29% underwent surveillance on time, 34% too early (median difference = 1.86) and 37% later than recommended (median difference = 1.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates was observed when too early surveillance versus appropriate surveillance (34% versus 33%; P=0.92) and too late surveillance versus appropriate surveillance (21% versus 33%; P=0.11) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Only a minority of surveillance colonoscopies were performed according to guideline recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deviation from the guidelines did not improve the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interventions aimed at improving adherence to surveillance guidelines are needed </plain></SENT>
