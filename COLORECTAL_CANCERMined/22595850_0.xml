<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Orthovoltage intraoperative radiotherapy provides one potential means of improving disease control at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to analyze outcomes and identify prognostic factors of patients treated with orthovoltage intraoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: This study is a retrospective chart review conducted at a tertiary medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Between January 1990 and July 2009, 55 patients underwent intraoperative radiotherapy to a total of 61 sites for locally advanced (n = 14) or recurrent (n = 41) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of colon</z:e> (n = 18) or rectum/rectosigmoid junction (n = 37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Median dose was 12 Gy (range, 7.5-20 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among locally advanced rectal/rectosigmoid cases, surgery included abdominoperineal resection (n = 3) or low anterior resection (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven treated sites had gross residual (R2) disease, 28 had pathologic or clinical microscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> (R1), and 15 were complete resections (R0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treated sites included sacrum (n = 22), anterior pelvis/pelvic sidewall (19), sacrum and sidewall (n = 1), aortic bifurcation (n = 2), vaginal cuff (n = 2), psoas (n = 3), perivesicular region (n = 2), and other (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Outcomes measures included in-field local control, locoregional control, overall survival, and grade â‰¥3 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 4-237) among living patients, 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of in-field local control, locoregional control, and overall survival were 69%, 51%, and 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Margin status predicted for improved locoregional control (p = 0.01) and overall survival (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (31%) developed a grade 3 to 5 toxicity following surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective nature and relatively small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Local control with intraoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancers</z:e> is good despite the high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among carefully selected patients, multimodality regimens including intraoperative radiotherapy may permit long-term survival </plain></SENT>
