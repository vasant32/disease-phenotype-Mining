<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate any significant benefit of laparoscopy in terms of postoperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This could be explained by the lack of a large sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> between 2006 and 2008 in France were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted from the French National Health Service Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis evaluating risk factors for POM was performed including the following factors: age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, associated comorbidities, emergency surgery, synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, and surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 3-year period, a total of 84,524 colorectal resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were performed: 22,359 through laparoscopy (26%) and 62,165 through laparotomy (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From 2006 to 2008, laparoscopic approach rate increased from 23% to 29% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>POM was 5.0%: 2% after laparoscopy and 6% after laparotomy (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, 7 independent factors were significantly associated with a higher POM: age 70 years or more [P &lt; 0.001, odds ratio (OR): 3.28; (3.00-3.59)], respiratory comorbidity [P &lt; 0.001, OR: 3.16; (2.91-3.37)], vascular comorbidity [P &lt; 0.001, OR: 2.66; (2.48-2.85)], neurologic comorbidity [P &lt; 0.001, OR: 1.78; (1.51-2.09)], emergency surgery [P &lt; 0.001, OR: 2.68; (2.48-2.90)], synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> [P &lt; 0.001, OR: 2.63; (2.41-2.86)], and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> [OR: 1.33; (1.19-1.50)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery [P &lt; 0.001, OR: 0.59; (0.54-0.65)] was independently associated with a significant decreased POM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-inclusive national study showed that POM after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery is significantly reduced in case of age less than 70 years, elective surgery, and absence of synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, respiratory, neurologic, or vascular comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is suggested that a laparoscopic surgery is independently associated with a decreased POM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This result, observed at a national level, must be considered when choosing the best surgical approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
