<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The APC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor is mutated or downregulated in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types, and is prominently localized to punctate clusters at protrusion tips in migratory cells, such as in astrocytes where it has been implicated in directed cell motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although APC loss is considered an initiating event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, for example, it is less clear what role APC plays in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell motility and whether loss of APC might be an important promoter of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in addition to initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The localization of APC and β-catenin was analyzed in multiple cell lines, including non-transformed epithelial lines treated with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> or TGFβ to induce an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as several <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> lines, by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APC expression was knocked down in 4T07 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mammary tumor</z:e> cells using lentiviral-mediated delivery of APC-specific short-hairpin (sh) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, and assessed using quantitative (q) reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cell motility was analyzed by performing wound-filling assays, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> via immunofluorescence (IF) and phase-contrast microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, proliferation was measured using BrdU incorporation, and TCF reporter assays were performed to determine β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APC/β-catenin-rich complexes were observed at protrusion ends of migratory epithelial cells treated with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> or when EMT has been induced and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with a mesenchymal, spindle-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4T07 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with reduced APC levels were significantly less motile and had a more rounded <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>; yet, they did not differ significantly in proliferation or β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that APC/β-catenin-rich complexes at protrusion ends were dependent upon an intact microtubule cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that membrane protrusions with APC/β-catenin-containing puncta control the migratory potential and mesenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mammary tumor</z:e> cells and suggest that APC loss during later stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> might impact <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell dissemination or colonization </plain></SENT>
