<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intestinal epithelium is a rapidly cycling tissue, always renewing every 4-5 days under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, which is maintained by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the fluorescence labelling trace, ISCs can be divided into two different types: active intestinal stem cells (A-ISCs) located in bottom of the intestinal crypt and the quiescent intestinal stem cells (Q-ISCs) in the +4 position of the crypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a complex signal regulation net between the ISCs and other intestinal cells, such as Wnt and Notch pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ISCs have an intimate relationship with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a deficiency of stem cells markers severely limits research on the biological characteristics of ISCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed several ISCs markers, including Lgr5, PHLDA1, Bmi1 and Lrig1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These markers have widely different biological functions, but also have a close relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis concerns the reasons for ISCs having two distinct types and why endless ISCs markers have emerged </plain></SENT>
