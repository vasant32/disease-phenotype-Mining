<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the well recognized expression of the cell surface markers cluster of differentiation 44 (homing cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule) and CD133 (Prominin 1) on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> stem cells (CCSCs), these molecules do not appear to be effective targets for stem cell-directed therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the surface marker CD66c (also known as carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 6) has demonstrated promise as a therapeutic target in pancreatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, the authors evaluated its potential as a target for stem cell-directed treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First, the authors characterized CD66c expression by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> samples and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, the coexpression of CD66c and CD133 was evaluated on putative CCSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD66c expression also was measured in stem cell-enriched colon spheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the effects of small-interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-mediated CD66c silencing on the in vitro and in vivo growth of Caco2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD66c expression was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> than in contiguous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues and paralleled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD66c was absent in CD133-positive cells that were isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon, whereas its expression was brightest (CD66c(bright) ) in CD133-positive cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments demonstrated that colon spheres were considerably enriched in a CD66c(bright) population in a fashion comparable to the enrichment observed in fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro proliferation and clonogenic potential were hampered when CD66c was silenced in Caco2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, in vivo xenograft experiments demonstrated that CD66c silencing almost completely abrogated the tumorigenic potential of Caco2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD66c(bright) expression was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> stem cells and CD66c silencing blocked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, thereby opening the way to a potential new treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
