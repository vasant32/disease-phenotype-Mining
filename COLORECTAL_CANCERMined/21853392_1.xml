<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Appropriate lymphatic assessment is a cornerstone of definitive surgical resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopy may allow real-time intraoperative identification of territorial lymphatic drainage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sentinel nodes</z:e> in patients with early-stage disease prior to radical basin resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With IRB approval and individual consent, consecutive patients with radiologically localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> underwent peritumoral submucosal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG, a fluorophore capable of injection site tattooing and efferent lymphatic migration) prior to standard laparoscopic oncological resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, a prototype NIR laparoscope provided both white light and, by switch activation, NIR irradiation with or without discrete spectral back-filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sentinel nodes</z:e> prior to formal specimen dissection allowed their identification for separate histopathological analysis by in situ clipping when found within the specimen or selective lymphadenectomy by "berry-picking" when such nodes lay outside of the standard resection field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concordance with nonsentinel nodes was then analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients (mean age = 66.4 years [range = 47.9-80.1], mean BMI = 29.1 [range = 20.0-39.9]) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen had biopsy-proven <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and four had endoscopically unresectable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mesocolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sentinel nodes</z:e> (mean = 4.1/patient) were rendered obvious by fluorescence either solely within the standard resection field (n = 14) or both within and without the planned field (n = 4) within minutes of dye injection in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic ultrasound (n = 5) as well as histopathological analysis demonstrated oncologic correlation of mesocolic sentinel with corresponding territory nonsentinel nodes, correctly confirming the presence of mesocolic disease in 3 patients and the absence of such lymphatic spread in the remaining 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, NIR laparoscopy with ICG mapping allowed ready and rapid confirmation of mesocolic lymphatic drainage patterns and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sentinel node</z:e> identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With further validation, this technology and technique promises precise, tailored resection surgery by indicating basin pattern and status in advance of radical lymphadenectomy </plain></SENT>
