<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally thought that patients with MA present at a more advanced stage of disease and have a poorer prognosis than those with other types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of mucinous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the Iranian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2002 and March 2008, Of the 1283 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, 110 patients were considered to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumors</z:e> according to pathology report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients evaluated on the basis of sex, age, location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, stage, differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used for survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of these patients at diagnosis was 50.07 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than 50% of patients were younger than aged 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>34.5% of patients had a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in their first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were presented in right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>54.3% of MA patients had advanced stage lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method indicated that, the 1, 3 and 5 year survival rates are 92.6, 80.1 and 41.3 percent, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Survival of the patients was related to disease stage (P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our suggests that genetic factors may be play an important role in the development of this disease in our country and screening programs, especially genetic screening programs, should be considered as a main measure for prevention and control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Iran </plain></SENT>
