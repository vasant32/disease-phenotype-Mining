<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: TIMP1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1) regulates extracellular matrix turnover and also promotes cell growth and has anti-apoptotic activity, which promotes malignant processes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the relation of plasma TIMP1 protein levels with prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, with particular regard to possible early-prediction of recurrence of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a group of 87 patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> (mostly from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, and assessed their preoperative plasma TIMP1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These levels were evaluated according to prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we measured plasma TIMP1 in the post-operative period and tried to relate the changes with the diagnosis of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found preoperative plasma TIMP1 levels to be related to overall survival in the group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> (p=0.0047), with a higher level being associated with an adverse outcome; the cut-off value was set at 165 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, regardless of the type of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the post-operative dynamics of TIMP1 was not found to be statistically significant to indicate disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found there to be a relationship between higher plasma levels of TIMP1 and an adverse prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The assessment of plasma TIMP1 levels could help the detection of patients with worse outcome </plain></SENT>
