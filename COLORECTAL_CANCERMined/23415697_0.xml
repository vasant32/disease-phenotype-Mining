<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (CTCs) can be enriched from peripheral blood by leukocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a PowerMag system was designed to enhance leukocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and CTC detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The efficiency of PowerMag in leukocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and recovery of CTCs was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell populations in leukocyte-depleted cell filtrate were characterized by immunofluorescence staining using anti-EpCAM and anti-CD45 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The suitability of PowerMag in monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patient CTCs was assessed by analyzing blood samples collected at baseline and 2weeks after baseline from the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, n=24) and head and neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e>, n=28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only few contaminated CD45(+)-leukocytes were retained in the leukocyte-depleted cell filtrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enriched CTCs were viable with a recovery rate of 46-62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence staining of the nucleated cells enriched by PowerMag revealed 2 major cell populations EpCAM(+)CD45(-) and EpCAM(-)CD45(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number for both cell types was significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients when compared to healthy control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After chemotherapy, the number of EpCAM(+)CD45(-) and EpCAM(-)CD45(-) cells was decreased more prominently for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HNSCC</z:e> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PowerMag holds great promise as a platform for leukocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and CTC detection in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
