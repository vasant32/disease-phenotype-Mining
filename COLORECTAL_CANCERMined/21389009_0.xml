<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Modifiable behavioural risk factors--including exercise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and smoking--have been causally associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, results have been inconsistent and undiagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> may affect baseline risk factors, distorting the temporal relationship that is observed between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> available in the Whitehall I study were predictive of colonic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective cohort study over 40 years on Whitehall I men aged 40-69 on entry between 1967 and 1970 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between baseline risk factors and cause-specific mortality were tested with Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Events within the first 10 years of follow-up were excluded to minimise 'reverse causality.' RESULTS: 329 colon and 121 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred among 17,949 men followed up for a total of 472,523 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age and smoking were associated with increased mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with never-smokers, current smoking was associated with age-adjusted HRs for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> of 1.45 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.03) and 1.97 (95% CI 1.02 to 3.80), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant effect of current smoking on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> mortality was only apparent after events in the first 10&amp;emsp14;years of follow-up were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No convincing evidence was found that body mass index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, blood pressure or physical activity were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Smoking significantly increases mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and its decreasing prevalence in the UK may partly explain falling mortality from the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in health behaviours in response to early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> symptoms may result in differential misclassification or 'reverse causality' unless early events are excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although many individual cohort studies have not shown significant relationships between behavioural risk factors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality, their contribution to meta-analyses remains important </plain></SENT>
