<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The structural characteristics of the NPs were determined using X-ray diffraction to analyze the interaction between CS and the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NPs were then evaluated in terms of their physicochemical characteristics, drug release behavior, in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters, and biodistribution in animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ABZ-loaded NPs with a uniformly spherical particle sizes (157.8 ± 2.82 nm) showed efficient drug loading, encapsulated efficiency, and high physical stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The drug release from ABZ-CS-NPs was extended over several periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kinetic models were then fitted to determine the release mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABZ and its metabolite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16959">albendazole sulfoxide</z:chebi> (ABZSX) were analyzed in rats with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6704">mebendazole</z:chebi> as the internal standard using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the ABZ suspension groups, the relative bioavailability values of ABZ and ABZSX were 146.05 and 222.15%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the plasma concentration versus time curve is consistent with that of the two compartment models in the plasma concentration versus time curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the ABZ-loaded NPs are promising novel ABZ candidates for passive diffusion in the treatment of hydatid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> in the liver via oral administration. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
