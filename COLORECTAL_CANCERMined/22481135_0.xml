<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been suggested that ROHs may contribute to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high rate of consanguinity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Saudi population prompted us to test the role of autozygosity in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk.Methods:We compared 48 Saudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients to 100 ethnically matched controls, processed on the Affymetrix 250K StyI SNP GeneChip platform and analyzed using the plink package.Results:We could find no evidence of a significant relationship between autozygosity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk.Conclusion:The negative results in our study add additional significance to what has been previously reported in literature, as this is the first study to address these questions in an inbred population </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although these results do not rule out the presence of recessively acting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-predisposing genes in a small percentage of patients, which our relatively small sample size could not capture, they suggest that such genes are unlikely to account for the disturbingly high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in our consanguineous population.Genet Med advance online publication 5 April 2012 </plain></SENT>
