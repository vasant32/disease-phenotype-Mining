<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence are reported around the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to provide temporal trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence over a 30-year period in a French well-defined population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1976 and 2005, 17,028 new cases were registered by the Burgundy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean variations in age-standardized incidence rates were estimated using a Poisson regression adjusted for age for each gender and location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk by birth cohort of developing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> over the age range 0-74 years was estimated using an age-cohort model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence rates for right and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> increased more rapidly in males (respectively +11.7% and +10.3% on average by 5-year period) than in females (respectively +5.9% and +6.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It remained stable for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751498" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">sigmoid cancers</z:e> in males (-0.1%) and decreased in females (-5.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also decreased for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> both in males (-2.7%) and in females (-2.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk increased from 3.9% for males born around 1900 to 4.9% for those born around 1930 and then slightly decreased (4.5% among those born around 1950) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It remained at the same level for females born around 1900 (2.7%) as for those born around 1930 (2.7%) and then slightly increased (2.9%) for those born around 1950 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>, the cumulative risk increased strikingly in successive birth cohorts from 0.53% to 1.2% in males and 0.55% to 0.77% in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The corresponding cumulative risks for the left colon were 0.24% and 0.42% in males and 0.14% and 0.29% in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751498" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">sigmoid cancer</z:e>, they decreased from 1.59% to 1.08% in males, and 0.88% to 0.80% in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Temporal variations in incidence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> differed according to subsite, suggesting different aetiological factors and implications for diagnosis and screening strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Total colonoscopy must be the preferred strategy in high-risk groups or after a positive faecal occult blood test </plain></SENT>
