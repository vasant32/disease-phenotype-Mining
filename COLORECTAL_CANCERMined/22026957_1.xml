<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activating mutations in this gene up-regulates the AKT signaling pathway, making it a potentially useful therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in PIK3CA are not exclusive of mutations in KRAS, BRAF, or NRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We designed a pyrosequencing assay to detect mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three positions of codons 542 and 545 in exon 9 and codon 1047 in exon 20 of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exon 9 reverse PCR primer was designed to avoid amplifying a pseudogene in chromosome 22 that has &gt;95% homology with exons 9 through 13 in PIK3CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> from FFPE tissue previously characterized for KRAS mutation status were evaluated for PIK3CA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In KRAS-mutated samples, 20% had an additional mutation in PIK3CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation rate in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> samples was 7.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When using our assay, pseudogene was not observed in any of these samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, pseudogene- and gene-specific amplification was performed on DNA from 40 additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of these PCR products yielded the expected gene or pseudogene sequence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have developed a PIK3CA pyrosequencing assay capable of detecting mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three positions in the three hot spot codons with no pseudogene interference </plain></SENT>
