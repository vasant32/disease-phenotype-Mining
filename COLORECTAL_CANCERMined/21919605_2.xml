<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed two cohorts of 302 and 290 patients, respectively, one cohort for exploratory analyses and another cohort for validating the exploratory analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of ten polymorphisms in genes involved in 5-FU pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multifactor dimensionality reduction was used to identify genetic interaction profiles associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low-expression alleles in thymidylate synthase (TYMS) were associated with decreased DFS and overall survival (DFS:hazard ratio [HR] exploration 2.65 [1.40-4.65]; p = 0.004, HR validation 1.69 [1.03-2.66]; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A specific multifactor dimensionality reduction derived combination of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and TYMS polymorphisms was associated with increased DFS (HR exploration 0.69 [0.49-0.98]; p = 0.04, HR validation 0.66 [0.45-0.95]; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific combinations of functional polymorphisms in DPYD and TYMS were demonstrated to be associated with DFS and overall survival in patients receiving adjuvant 5-FU-based treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically high TYMS expression alleles seem to be associated with decreased DFS </plain></SENT>
