<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of netrin-1 and its receptors UNC5A, UNC5B, UNC5C, UNC5D, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 2b receptor (A2BAR), deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>), and neogenin in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and alkali-burned rat cornea were determined by RT-PCR and/or Western blot analysis, or immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Topical netrin-1 protein was applied to treat rat corneal alkali-burn injury for 14 consecutive days, started right after the injury or 10 days postinjury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corneal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and neovascularization were observed under slit lamp microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of corneal cells was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Corneal inflammatory cell infiltration was evaluated by immunostaining of anti-PMN and anti-ED1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF), and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in rat cornea was determined by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Netrin-1 and its receptor UNC5B were expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat corneal epithelium and stromal cells, and their expression decreased after corneal alkali burn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exogenous netrin-1 administered on rat ocular surfaces resolved alkali burn-induced corneal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and also suppressed corneal neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, netrin-1 could reverse neovascularization in alkali-burned cornea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors found that netrin-1 executed the functions through various mechanisms, including upregulating EGF expression, accelerating epithelial wound healing, inhibiting neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, reducing corneal cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and restoring the equilibrium of VEGF and PEDF in the wounded cornea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Netrin-1 could dampen <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, inhibit, and reverse neovascularization in alkali-burned cornea </plain></SENT>
