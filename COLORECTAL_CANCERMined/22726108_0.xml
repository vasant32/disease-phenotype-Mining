<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another purpose was to explore the relationship between demographic variables, perceived social support, and caregiver burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 100 PFCs of postsurgery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCPs</z:chebi>) in one teaching hospital in the Taipei area of Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The research instruments included the Caregiver Reaction Assessment and the Medical Outcome Study-Social Support Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The caregivers' total burden mean was 3.00 (SD= 0.50, range = 2.00-4.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Social support demonstrated a significant relationship with family caregiver burden (impact on health: r=-0.48, p &lt; .01; impact on schedule: r=-0.58, p &lt; .01; impact on finances: r=-0.44, p &lt; .01; lack of family support: r=-0.54, p &lt; .01; and impact on total scale: r=-0.64, p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher perceived social support reported by caregivers predicted lower caregiver burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified social support as a significant independent influence on caregiver burden after controlling for key demographic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Social support accounted for 33% (R(2) increment = 0.33, p &lt; .001) of the variance in caregiver burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the importance of social support on caregiver burden in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future interventions should include social support to help alleviate caregiver burden in <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCPs</z:chebi> following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of this study emphasize the important role of social support to enable healthcare professionals to become more effective while caring for caregivers of the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who has undergone surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present study may facilitate cross-cultural comparison and cultural-oriented management of caregiver burden </plain></SENT>
