<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c-myc transcriptional suppressor, far-upstream element (FUSE)-binding protein (FBP)-interacting repressor (FIR), is alternatively spliced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue (Matsushita et al., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Res 2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the knockdown of SAP155 pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-splicing factor, a subunit of SF3b, was reported to disturb FIR pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing and yield FIRΔexon2, an exon 2-spliced variant of FIR, which lacks c-myc repression activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, novel splicing variants of FIR, Δ3 and Δ4, were also generated by SAP155 siRNA, and these variants were found to be activated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression levels of FIR variant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were examined in the peripheral blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and healthy volunteers to assess its potency for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, circulating FIR variant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the peripheral blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were significantly overexpressed compared to that in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of FIR, FIRΔexon2 or FIRΔexon2/FIR, was greater than those of conventional carcinoembryonic antigen or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, FIRΔexon2 or FIR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the peripheral blood was significantly reduced after operative removal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, circulating FIR and FIRΔexon2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> are potential novel screening markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> testing with conventional carcinoembryonic antigen and or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results indicate that overexpression of FIR and its splicing variants in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> directs feed-forward or addicted circuit c-myc transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical implications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> of novel FIR splicing variants are also discussed in the present paper </plain></SENT>
