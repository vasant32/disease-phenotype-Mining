<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Health threats that were historically responsible for immeasurable tolls on human life are now <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but eradicated within certain populations, specifically those that enjoy higher degrees of socio-economic status and access to healthcare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, modernization and its resulting lifestyle trends have ushered in a new era of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illness; one in which an unprecedented number of people are estimated to contract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we explore the idea that homeostasis has been redefined within just a few generations, and that diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are the result of fluctuating physiological and molecular imbalances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phytochemical-deprived, pro-inflammatory diets combined with low-dose exposures to environmental toxins, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33216">bisphenol-A</z:chebi> (BPA) and other <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> disruptors, are now linked to increasing incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in westernized societies and developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is recent evidence that disease determinants are likely set in utero and further perpetuated into adulthood dependent upon the innate and environmentally acquired phenotype unique to each individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to address a disease as multi-factorial, case-specific, and remarkably adaptive as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, research must focus on its root causes in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which they can be prevented or counteracted via plant-derived compounds such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">epigallocatechin-3-gallate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significant role of epigenetics in the regulation of these complex processes is emphasized here to form a comprehensive view of the dynamic interactions that influence modern-day <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, and how sensibly restoring homeostatic balance may be the key to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> riddle </plain></SENT>
