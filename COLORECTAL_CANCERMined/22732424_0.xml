<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to germ-line mutations in DNA repair genes, which cause a strong deficiency in DNA repair activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types, the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is unclear also because deficiencies in DNA repair, if any, are expected to be much milder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further slowing down progress are the paucity of accurate and reproducible functional assays and poor epidemiological design of many studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on the most common and widely studied SNPs of oxidative DNA damage repair proteins trying to bridge the information available on biochemical and structural features of the repair proteins with the functional effects of these variants and their potential impact on the pathogenesis of disease </plain></SENT>
