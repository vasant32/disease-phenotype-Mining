<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate BLI magnification in comparison with narrow-band imaging (NBI) magnification for the diagnosis of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicenter open study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 104 colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were examined with BLI and NBI magnifications in Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine and Fukuoka University Chikushi Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular and surface patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> under BLI magnification were compared with those under NBI magnification, using a published NBI classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was the correlation between the NBI classification diagnosed by BLI or NBI magnification and the histopathological analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, 34 cases of intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and shallowly invaded submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and eight cases of deeply invaded submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy of BLI magnification in the NBI classification was 74.0 % (77/104), similar to that of NBI magnification (77.8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The consistency rate between BLI and NBI magnification in the NBI classification was 74.0 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concerning image evaluation, the interobserver variability of two expert endoscopists (N.Y. and T.H.) in BLI magnification was κ = 0.863 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the intraobserver variability of the two endoscopists was κ = 0.893 (N.Y.) and 0.851 (T.H.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BLI magnification by laser source could predict histopathological diagnosis and invasion depth of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic effectiveness of this method was similar to that of NBI magnification </plain></SENT>
