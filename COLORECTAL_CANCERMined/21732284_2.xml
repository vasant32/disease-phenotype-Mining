<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two common functional polymorphisms of MTHFR, 677 C→T and 1298 A→C, have been shown to impact various diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 677 C→T polymorphism has been widely investigated in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated MTHFR C677T genotype frequency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases in the Kashmiri population and correlated this information with the known clinicopathological characters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, in a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases were studied for MTHFR C677T polymorphism, compared to 160 controls taken from the general population, employing the PCR-RFLP technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found the frequency of the three different genotypes of MTHFR in our ethnic Kashmir population, i.e., CC, CT and TT, to be 68.6, 20.9 and 10.4% among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases and 75.6, 16.9 and 7.5% among the general control population, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between the MTHFR TT genotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the higher age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism slightly increases the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development in our ethnic Kashmir population </plain></SENT>
