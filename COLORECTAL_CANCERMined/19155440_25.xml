<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Associations of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms at 8q24, 9p24, and 18q21 (SMAD7) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were investigated in a three-center collaborative study including two U.K. case-control cohorts (Sheffield and Leeds) and a U.S. case-control study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases from high-risk Utah pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our combined resource included 1,092 CRC case subjects and 1,060 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta statistics and Monte Carlo significance testing using Genie software provided a valid combined analysis of our mixed independent and related case-control resource </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated whether these associations differed by sex, age at diagnosis, family history, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 8q24, we observed two independent significant associations at single nucleotide polymorphisms located in two different risk regions of 8q24: rs6983267 in region 3 [P(trend) = 0.01; per allele odds ratio (OR), 1.17; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.03-1.32] and rs10090154 in region 5 (P(trend) = 0.05; per allele OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 18q21, associations were observed in distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> but not in proximal or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e>: rs4939827 (P(trend) = 0.007; per allele OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.93; case-case p(diff) = 0.03) and rs12953717 (P(trend) = 0.01; per allele OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We were unable to detect any associations at 9p24 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation confirms that variants across multiple risk regions of 8q24 are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and that associations at 18q21 differ by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site </plain></SENT>
