<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 76 CRC patients who were scheduled to undergo surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>UFT (300 mg/m(2)/day) and LV (75 mg/body/day) were administered for 2 weeks before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples were endoscopically obtained before drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene expression levels of 14 genes in the biopsy samples were quantitatively evaluated using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (19.7 %) with marked pathological regression were judged to be responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">Thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase (TP) gene expression levels among the responders were significantly higher than those among the non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with high TP gene expression levels were associated with a significantly higher response rate to UFT/LV chemotherapy than left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TP gene expression levels in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> site may be useful predictors of the efficacy of oral UFT/LV chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
