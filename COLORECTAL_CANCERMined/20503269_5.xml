<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rates among races/ethnicities other than Whites or Blacks have not been frequently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> rates by sex across anatomic subsite, age and racial/ethnic groups, we used the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program for cases diagnosed among residents of 13 registries during 1992-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates were expressed per 100,000 person-years and age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population; MF IRR and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among each racial/ethnic group, the MF IRR increased fairly monotonically from close to unity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149640,C0153437" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cecal cancers</z:e> to 1.81 (Hispanics) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MF IRRs increased with age most rapidly for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> from &lt;1.0 at ages &lt;50 years to 1.4-1.9 at older ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MF IRR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> also rose with age from about 1.0 to 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the MF IRR was consistently &lt;1.5; among American Indian/Alaska Natives, it was &lt;1.0 across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MF IRRs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> vary markedly according to subsite and age but less by racial/ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may partially reflect differences in screening experiences and access to medical care but also suggest that etiologic factors may be playing a role </plain></SENT>
