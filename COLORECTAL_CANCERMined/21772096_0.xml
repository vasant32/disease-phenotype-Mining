<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An oral fluoropyrimidine, S-1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil), has been developed recently, and a combination of S-1/<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 demonstrated effects comparable to FOLFIRI for the treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Being without continuous infusion lasting for days, combination chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidine may limit inconvenience and improve the quality of life (QOL) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There have been few studies evaluating chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidine in terms of patient QOL and convenience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the patients' QOL by questionnaire, comparing experiences of those treated with S-1/<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 to those treated with mFOLFOX6 in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire, selected from EORTC QLQ, FACT-G, and FACT/GOG-Ntx, consisted of six categories: moving activity, willingness, pain and numbness, gastrointestinal symptoms, daily life, and convenience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire had 5 questions in each category and a total of 30 questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients' background and characteristics were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in response rates and time to progression between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As for adverse effects, there was a case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (grade 2), five cases of neurotoxicites (grade 1 and 2) in mFOL-FOX6, and a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (grade 3) in S-1/<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference between the two groups was observed in responses to the questionnaire asking about moving activity, willingness, gastrointestinal symptoms, and daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As for neurotoxicity and convenience, however, S-1/<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 showed significantly better results than mFOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that questionnaires are useful for assessing patients' QOL with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Combination chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 could provide similar response rates, limit inconvenience, and improve QOL </plain></SENT>
