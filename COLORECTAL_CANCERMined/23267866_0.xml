<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insights include an increased recognition of the malignant potential of different types of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> such as sessile and traditional serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> share molecular features with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> that have microsatellite instability and a methylator phenotype, indicating that these lesions are precursors that progress via the serrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data have important implications for clinical practice and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention, because <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> were previously regarded as having no malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence that the serrated pathway contributes to interval or missed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic detection of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> is a challenge because they are often inconspicuous with indistinct margins and are frequently covered by adherent mucus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is important for gastroenterologists to recognize the subtle endoscopic features of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> to facilitate their detection and removal, and thereby ensure a high-quality colonoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the role of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> has led to the inclusion of these lesions in postpolypectomy surveillance guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, an enhanced effort is needed to identify and completely remove serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of colonoscopy to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
