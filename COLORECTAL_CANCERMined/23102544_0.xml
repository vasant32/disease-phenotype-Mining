<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiotoxicity is a less common but potentially lethal complication of 5-FU or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> treatment, and some physicians might be unfamiliar with treatment alternatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rechallenging should be avoided because it carries a high risk of recurrence of the cardiac symptoms and prophylactic treatment is not always protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Possible alternative treatment options to be considered are to replace the oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> or intravenous 5-FU by a 5-FU bolus regimen, by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>-tegafur or tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil, both oral fluoropyrimidines combining a 5-FU <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> with a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitor, or by raltitrexed, a thymidilate synthase inhibitor whose metabolism is independent of DPD </plain></SENT>
