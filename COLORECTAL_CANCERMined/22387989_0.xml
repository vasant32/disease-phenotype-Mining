<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genomic instability increases with disease progression and biopsies more proximal to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed increased instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pan-colonic field copy number gain or loss involving small (&lt;1Mb) regions were detected in most patients and were particularly apparent in the UC progressor patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal copy gains or losses affecting large regions were mainly restricted to dysplastic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas of significant chromosomal losses were detected in the UC progressors on chromosomes 2q36, 3q25, 3p21, 4q34, 4p16.2, 15q22, and 16p13 (p-valueâ©½0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results extend our understanding of the dynamic nature of pan-colonic genomic instability in this disease </plain></SENT>
