<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The genotypes of H-ras and L-myc genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis and logistic model were used to detect the gene-gene interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene-gene interaction was validated by multifactor dimensionality reduction (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The single SNP model showed that the polymorphisms of H-ras and L-myc genes were not significantly related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis revealed that among the L-myc LS + SS genotype carriers, those with H-ras TC + CC genotype showed significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> than those with TT genotype (OR = 1.81, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive interaction between L-myc and H-ras was detected by logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OR of the interaction effect was 2.74 (P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result was confirmed in the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> model, with 54.83% testing balanced accuracy and 10/10 cross-validation consistency, and the model was still significant after the 1000 times permutation test (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the polymorphism of H-ras and L-myc genes is not related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, but there is a synergy between H-ras and L-myc polymorphisms in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
