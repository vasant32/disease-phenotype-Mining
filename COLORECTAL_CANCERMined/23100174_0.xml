<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased risk of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> has been observed in some trials in older patients, and the potential benefit of a maintenance therapy with bevacizumab alone has not been clearly demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XELOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) plus bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab alone in elderly patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Treatment consisted of bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 130 mg/m(2) on day 1, plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14, every 3 weeks up to a maximum of 8 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients then received maintenance therapy consisting of bevacizumab alone (7.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks up to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary study end-points were safety and response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate was 52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37 to 68%], with 86% of patients achieving disease control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median PFS and overall survival were 11.5 months (95% CI 10.0-12.9 months) and 19.3 months (95% CI 16.5-22.1 months), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 10 patients (23%) had grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), the most common being <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (7%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients died because of treatment-related AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of bevacizumab-related AEs (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, and gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>) was consistent with that reported earlier in the general <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of XELOX and bevacizumab is effective and has a manageable tolerability profile when administered to elderly patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Maintenance therapy with single-agent bevacizumab may be considered to extend PFS in this setting of patients </plain></SENT>
