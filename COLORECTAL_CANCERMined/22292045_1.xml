<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A considerable proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> could be explained by the coinheritance of multiple low-penetrance variants, some of which are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> conferred by genetic variants at the TGFBR1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 14 polymorphisms and the allele-specific expression (ASE) of TGFBR1 in 1025 individuals from the Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was undertaken with 504 controls and 521 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen polymorphisms located at the TGFBR1 locus were genotyped with the iPLEX Gold (MassARRAY-Sequenom) technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Descriptive analyses of the polymorphisms and haplotypes and association studies were performed with the SNPator workpackage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relevant associations were detected between individual polymorphisms or haplotypes and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TGFBR1*9A/6A polymorphism was used for the ASE analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous individuals were analyzed for ASE by fragment analysis using cDNA from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relative level of allelic expression was extrapolated from a standard curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cutoff value was calculated with Youden's index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ASE was found in 25.4% of patients and 16.4% of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Considering both bimodal and continuous types of distribution, no significant differences between the ASE values of patients and controls were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a combined analysis of the polymorphisms and ASE for the association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> occurrence revealed that ASE-positive individuals carrying one of the most common haplotypes (H2: 20.7%) showed remarkable susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (RR: 5.25; 95% CI: 2.547-5.250; p&lt;0.001) with a synergy factor of 3.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In our study, 54.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were attributable to the coinheritance of the H2 haplotype and TGFBR1 ASE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that the allelic architecture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genes, rather than individual polymorphisms, more accurately defines the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
