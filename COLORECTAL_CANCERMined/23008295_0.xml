<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the clinical relevance of the findings, analyses of the influence of combined hormone therapy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality were conducted after extended follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The WHI study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 16,608 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus who were randomly assigned to daily 0.625 mg conjugated equine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> plus 2.5 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6716">medroxyprogesterone acetate</z:chebi> (n = 8,506) or matching placebo (n = 8,102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis rates and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean of 5.6 years (standard deviation [SD], 1.03 years) of intervention and 11.6 years (SD, 3.1 years) of total follow-up, fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were diagnosed in the combined hormone therapy group compared with the placebo group (diagnoses/year, 0.12% v 0.16%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.94; P = .014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bowel screening examinations were comparable between groups throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> in the combined hormone therapy group more commonly had positive lymph nodes (50.5% v 28.6%; P &lt; .001) and were at higher stage (regional or distant, 68.8% v 51.4%; P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significant, there was a higher number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the combined hormone therapy group (37 v 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; 0.04% v 0.03%; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.78 to 2.11; P = .320) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings, suggestive of diagnostic delay, do not support a clinically meaningful benefit for combined hormone therapy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
