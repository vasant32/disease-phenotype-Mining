<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Currently there is no reliable technique for predicting clinical or pathologic complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response after radiochemotherapy (RCT) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied reverse phase protein microarray (RPMA) technology to find a signal pathway that may predict the response to preoperative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> samples were collected during preoperative RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had a good response to preoperative therapy (Mandard grade I-II) and 8 patients had a poor response (Mandard grade III-V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using laser capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) and RPMA analysis, we measured the phosphorylation level of nearly 80 end points and analyzed the signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 4 signaling proteins whose phosphorylation levels were significantly different (P &lt; .05) between the good vs. poor responders; CHK2 and β-catenin were more highly phosphorylated in poor responders, whereas PDK1 and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase (GSK)-3α/β had lower phosphorylation levels in poor responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly GSK-3α/β, β-catenin, and PDK1 are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> present in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we hypothesize that the activating state of the PI3K-AKT pathway can stratify patients who could benefit most from neoadjuvant treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, identification of theranostic targets has the potential to pinpoint new therapeutic strategies for the nonresponsive population </plain></SENT>
