<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study we applied a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis approach, MethylCap-seq, to map the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in 24 tumors and matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 2687 frequently hypermethylated and 468 frequently hypomethylated regions were identified, which include potential biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples was enriched at CpG islands and gene promoters, while hypomethylation was distributed throughout the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using epigenetic data from human embryonic stem cells, we show that frequently hypermethylated regions coincide with bivalent loci in human embryonic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation is commonly thought to lead to gene silencing; however, integration of publically available gene expression data indicates that 75% of the frequently hypermethylated genes were most likely already lowly or not expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our study provides genome-wide DNA methylation maps of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, comprehensive lists of DMRs, and gives insights into the role of aberrant DNA methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
