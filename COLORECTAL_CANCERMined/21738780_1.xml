<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) plays a key role in the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The function of NFκB is inhibited by binding to NFκB inhibitor (IκB), and disruption of the balance of NFκB and IκB is related to the development of many diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that the NFκB1 (-94del/insATTG) and NFκBIA (2758 A&gt;G) polymorphisms were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control study of 1001 CRC patients and 1005 cancer-free controls frequency matched by age and sex, we genotyped polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and performed luciferase assays and Western blotting analysis to identify whether genetic variants in NFκBIA alter its gene expressions and functions and thus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that both NFκB1-94 ins/delATTG and NFκBIA 2758 A&gt;G polymorphisms were correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.14-1.86, and OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.14-1.66, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when evaluated these two polymorphisms together, the combined genotypes with 2 variant (risk) alleles (2758GG and -94ins/ins+del/ins) were associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.23-2.38) compared to 0 variant, and the significant trend for 2 variant (risk) alleles were more pronounced among subgroups of aged &lt;60 years, women, never drinkers, never smokers, persons with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMI and those with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>(P(trend)&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, luciferase assays showed that the G allele in the 3'UTR significantly decreased NFκBIA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stability and the A allele regulation by miRNA449a in vitro and that the NFκBIA protein expression levels of the AA+AG variant carriers were significantly higher in peritumoral tissues than those of the 2758GG genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NFκB1 and NFκBIA polymorphisms appear to jointly contribute to risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These two variants may be a genetic modifier for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility in this southern Chinese population </plain></SENT>
