<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This a First in Human phase I study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and preliminary efficacy of AT9283 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> received AT9283 as a continuous central venous infusion over 3 days in cohorts of three to six patients starting at 1.5 mg/m(2)/day (equivalent to 4.5 mg/m(2)/72 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The oral bioavailability of AT9283 was assessed in a cohort of seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacodynamic analysis of biomarkers included phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 on serine 10, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Ki67, M30 and M65 in skin and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients were included in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AT9283 was generally well tolerated with main toxic effects of reversible dose-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, gastrointestinal disturbance, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dose-limiting toxicity of AT9283 was grade 3 febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in two patients at 36 mg/m(2)/72 h and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 27 mg/m(2)/72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systemic exposure was dose proportional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean oral bioavailability of a 0.9 mg/m(2) dose was 29.4% (range 11.2%-36.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pharmacodynamic analyses indicated antiproliferative and apoptotic activity of AT9283 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients with esophageal, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> (n = 2) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> demonstrated RECIST stable disease â‰¥ 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AT9283 was well tolerated up to the MTD of 27 mg/m(2)/72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AT9283 is currently assessed in phase II trials </plain></SENT>
