<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because there is evidence that some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-infiltrating CD8+ T cells may be inactive, the present study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of Granzyme B, one of the major effector molecules of T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A tissue microarray containing 963 CRCs was stained immunohistochemically for Granzyme B and the level of expression quantified by digital image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granzyme B expression was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with microsatellite instability (P &lt; 0.0001), a dense lymphocytic infiltrate (P &lt; 0.0001) and location in the proximal colon (P = 0.009), but lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with vascular invasion (P = 0.007), perineural invasion (P =0.041) and positive nodal status (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated expression of Granzyme B was associated with improved survival on univariate analysis (hazard ratio = 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.84; P = 0.001), but not in a multivariate model that included stage, vascular invasion and FoxP3+ T(reg) cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of Granzyme B was associated with early signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stronger prognostic significance of FoxP3+ T(regs) is in keeping with animal models that suggest these cells act as gatekeepers for the release of Granzyme B from CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
