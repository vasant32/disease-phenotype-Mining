<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourty colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> surgical specimens were immunohistochemically studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantification of microvessel density was realized at 400× magnification, in the intratumoral and peritumoral areas and distant from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With simple immunostains, it was very difficult to identify the type of vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With CD105/smooth muscle actin double-labeling stain we determined vessels maturation grade and identified the following types of vessels: isolated endothelial cells, immature, intermediary, mature and activated mature vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The density of intermediate vessels was higher in well-differentiated (2 ± 0.03) than in moderately (0.14 ± 0,02) or poorly differentiated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (0.07 ± 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such vessel types could not be identified with simple immunostains, and we believe that this is one reason why double-labeling immunostaining with CD105/smooth muscle actin should be used to study <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the density of intermediate vessels, correlated with the histological grade, could indicate the success or failure of the antiangiogenic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double-labeling immunostaining is indispensable to study vessel maturation grade </plain></SENT>
