<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the catalytic domain of PI3K that generate a dominantly active kinase are commonly found in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and have been thought to drive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> but not initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of constitutively activated PI3K upon the intestinal mucosa have not been previously studied in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the expression of a dominantly active form of the PI3K protein in the mouse intestine results in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice expressing constitutively active PI3K in the epithelial cells of the distal small bowel and colon rapidly developed invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in the colon that spread into the mesentery and adjacent organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histologic characteristics of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were strikingly similar to invasive mucinous <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> formed without a benign polypoid intermediary, consistent with the lack of aberrant WNT signaling observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, our findings indicate a noncanonical mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> initiation that is mediated through activation of PI3K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This unique model has the potential to further our understanding of human disease and facilitate the development of therapeutics through pharmacologic screening and biomarker identification </plain></SENT>
