<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the results are still inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, we performed this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 studies were included in the final meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were seven studies for unselected mCRC patients and four studies for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among unselected mCRC patients, BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 48 of 546 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (8.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The objective response rate (ORR) of patients with mutant BRAF was 29.2% (14/48), whereas the ORR of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> BRAF was 33.5% (158/472).The overall RR for ORR of mutant BRAF patients over <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> BRAF patients was 0.86 (95% CI=0.57-1.30; P=0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mCRC, BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 40 of 376 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (10.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ORR of patients with mutant BRAF was 0.0% (0/40), whereas the ORR of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> BRAF was 36.3% (122/336) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pooled RR of mutant BRAF patients over <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> BRAF patients was 0.14 (95% CI=0.04-0.53; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that BRAF V600E mutation is associated with lack of response in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS mCRC treated with anti-EGFR MoAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation may be used as an additional biomarker for the selection of mCRC patients who might benefit from anti-EGFR MoAbs therapy </plain></SENT>
