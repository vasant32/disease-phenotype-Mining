<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is a new and effective locoregional anticancer therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Markers for prediction of therapy response and prognosis are needed for the individual management of those patients undergoing SIRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples were prospectively and consecutively taken from 49 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> before, three, six, 24 and 48 h after SIRT to analyze the concentrations of nucleosomes and further laboratory parameters, and to compare them with the response to therapy regularly determined 3 months after therapy and with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circulating nucleosomes, cytokeratin-19 fragments (CYFRA 21-1), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and various liver markers increased already 24 h after SIRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretherapeutical levels of CYFRA 21-1, CEA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), asparate-aminotransferase (AST) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as 24 h values of nucleosomes were significantly higher in patients suffering from disease progression (N = 35) than in non-progressive patients (N = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concerning overall survival, CEA, CA 19-9, CYFRA 21-1, CRP, LDH, AST, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> esterase (CHE), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi>-transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and amylase (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 0 h, 24 h) and nucleosomes (24 h) were found to be prognostic relevant markers in univariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate Cox-Regression analysis, the best prognostic model was obtained for the combination of CRP and AST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When 24 h values were additionally included, nucleosomes (24 h) further improved the existing model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Panels of biochemical markers are helpful to stratify pretherapeutically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients for SIR-therapy and to early estimate the response to SIR-therapy </plain></SENT>
