<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tried to identify the prognosis-related protein profile by applying two different quantitative proteomic techniques, difference in-gel electrophoresis and cleavable isotope-coded affinity tag method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues were obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients, of which three have survived more than five years (good prognostic group, GPG) and the other three died within 25 months (poor prognostic group, <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) after palliative surgery and subsequent chemotherapy treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the two independent quantitative analyses, we identified 175 proteins with abundance ratios greater than 2-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene ontology analysis revealed that proteins related to cellular assembly/organization and movement were generally increased in the <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two proteins, including caveolin-1, were chosen for confirmatory studies by Western blot and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Western blot data for each individual protein were analyzed with Mann-Whitney tests, and a multi-marker panel was generated by logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five proteins, fatty acid binding protein 1, intelectin 1, transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, transgelin and tropomyosin 2, were significantly different between the two prognostic groups within 95% confidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No single protein could completely distinguish the two groups from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a combination of the five proteins effectively distinguished <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi> from GPG patients (AUC=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests a multi-marker panel composed of proteome signatures that provide accurate predictive information and potentially assist personalized therapy </plain></SENT>
