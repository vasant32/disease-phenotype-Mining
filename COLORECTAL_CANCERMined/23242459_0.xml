<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To date, associations between the number of lymph nodes evaluated, staging, and survival have been examined in the context of large population-based studies conducted by a small number of investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although high-quality data are available, perspective is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies for this paper were identified by searches of Medline, Scopus, PubMed, and manual searching of references from articles, using the search terms ''<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>'', ''nodal status'' and ''lymph node'' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It is clear that survival benefit increases with the increasing number of lymph nodes harvested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite this observation, there has been no significant increase in the proportion of node-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> over the past two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The nodal positivity rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> consistently approximates 40 % across a wide range of studies internationally, a phenomenon that has not previously been recognized in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We review the evidence and introduce the concept of a nodal positivity constant </plain></SENT>
