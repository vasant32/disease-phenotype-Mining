<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied weekly CEA during one fluorouracil-based chemotherapy cycle, correlated with long-term (8-12 week interval) computed tomography (CT) and CEA responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: CEA, liver function tests and inflammatory parameters were measured prospectively at baseline, day 7, day 14, and after the cycle (day 21/28), in 60 patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CEA non-significantly decreased at day 7 and was increased on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In progressive disease, CEA increased significantly during the evaluation cycle (55.4 μg/l vs. 148.2 μg/l; p=0.024), but the level was stable in patients with disease control (10.6 μg/l vs. 17.8 μg/l; p=0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CEA fluctuation correlated neither with liver function test nor with inflammatory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation of long-term response was most evident in progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEA should not be measured during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based oral chemotherapy nor within two weeks from intravenous chemotherapy administration </plain></SENT>
