<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Synthesized as zymogens, MMPs become active after removal of their prodomains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Much is known about the metalloprotease activity of these enzymes, but noncanonical functions are poorly defined, and functions of the prodomains have been largely ignored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report a novel metalloprotease-independent, channel-modulating function for the prodomain of MMP23 (MMP23-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell patch clamping and confocal microscopy, coupled with deletion analysis, demonstrate that MMP23-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> suppresses the voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel K(V)1.3, but not the closely related K(V)1.2 channel, by trapping the channel intracellularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies with K(V)1.2-1.3 chimeras suggest that MMP23-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> requires the presence of the K(V)1.3 region from the S5 trans-membrane segment to the C terminus to modulate K(V)1.3 channel function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NMR studies of MMP23-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> reveal a single, kinked trans-membrane α-helix, joined by a short linker to a juxtamembrane α-helix, which is associated with the surface of the membrane and protected from exchange with the solvent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The topological similarity of MMP23-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> to KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE4 proteins that trap K(V)1.3, K(V)1.4, K(V)3.3, and K(V)3.4 channels early in the secretory pathway suggests a shared mechanism of channel regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMP23 and K(V)1.3 expression is enhanced and overlapping in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> where the interaction of the two proteins could affect cell function </plain></SENT>
