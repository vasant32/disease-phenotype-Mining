<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CD73 expression dynamics were detected by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of CD73 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues from two independent cohorts by tissue microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optimal cutpoint of CD73 expression was assessed by the X-tile program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Western blotting analysis demonstrated that CD73 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was significantly higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the X-tile program, the cutpoint for high expression of CD73 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was determined when CD73 expression index was more than 5.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High expression of CD73 was observed in 44.8% and 50.4% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the training and validation cohorts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of CD73 was significantly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, nodal status, American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with high expression of CD73 had a poorer overall survival rate compared with patients with low expression of CD73 in both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate Cox regression analysis, overexpression of CD73 was proven to be an independent prognostic biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High expression of CD73 can be an independent and useful biomarker for predicting the poor survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
