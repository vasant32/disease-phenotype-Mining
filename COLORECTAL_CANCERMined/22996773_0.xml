<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the safety of treatment containing BV for advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From June 2008 to December 2010, 22 patients were treated with BV in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We classified them into three groups: less than 65 years (group A: 8 patients), 66-75 years (group B: 9 patients), and more than 76 years (group C: 5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, we compared the adverse events involving BV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient median age was 71 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5 (range 45-84)years old; 10 patients were treated in first-line therapy and 12 patients in second-line therapy or beyond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was one (12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5%) in group A, 3 (33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3%)in group B, and 3 (60%) in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment was continued in 4 patients, and discontinued in 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reasons for discontinuing BV treatment were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in 14 patients, toxicities in 3 patients, and degradation of performance state in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BV-associated adverse events had a tendency to become severe with aging, and patients for whom BV treatment was discontinued because of toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Severe adverse events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were observed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These patients had risk factors for BV-associated adverse events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or a history of radiation therapy, besides the risk factor of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that BV-associated adverse events are highly frequent and severe in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Especially in patients over 76 years old, risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and severe adverse events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The administration of BV for elderly patients should be considered very carefully </plain></SENT>
