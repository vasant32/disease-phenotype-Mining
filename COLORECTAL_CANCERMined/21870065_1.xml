<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explores the extent to which health professionals involved with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients address work matters during active treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen health professionals from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo>, occupational health and general practice were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Health professionals provide conflicting and limited information to patients regarding ability to work during treatment, or when to return to work thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lack of knowledge about impacts of treatment and symptoms on work ability and sustainability, particularly in relation to different occupations and work tasks resulted in providers offering minimal guidance to patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current practices relied on providers' previous experiences with employed patients, rather than a sound evidence-base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The type of work-related information given to patients by providers is not systematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to develop a better knowledge base about the impacts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and its treatment on work ability, sustainability and return to work that would help providers to offer more tailored advice to patients, consistently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is appropriate to recommend that formal training for providers is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enhancing the quality of information and training for health professionals to provide better work-related support to patients during the early stages of treatment could enable individuals to manage their work more effectively and facilitate a successful transition from patient to survivor </plain></SENT>
