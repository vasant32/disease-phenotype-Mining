<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical and cohort studies have shown that low-dose aspirin and calcium are effective low-risk strategies for primary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the cost-effectiveness of aspirin and calcium chemoprevention used with colonoscopy for primary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations for a population of 100,000 persons, with a colonoscopy compliance rate of 50%, were used for the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected, colonoscopy was repeated every 4 years until no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data sources included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> transition rates, initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidences, and treatment complication rates from existing literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted U.S. standard population mortality rates were used and costs were from Medicare reimbursement data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The target population was U.S. adults, undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening from ages 50 to 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Outcomes included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), life-years saved (LYS), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free years saved (CFYS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ICER per LYS for colonoscopy alone dominated compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with colonoscopy alone, colonoscopies with aspirin (ICER = $12,950/LYS) or calcium (ICER = $13,041/LYS) were the next most cost-effective strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICERs per CFYS were $3,061 and $2,317 for aspirin and calcium, respectively, when added to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses indicated that initial prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was a main determinant of prevention cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low-dose aspirin or calcium supplementation may be beneficial when added to colonoscopy, for optimum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention, at small incremental costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Impact: Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that aspirin and calcium in combination with colonoscopies are cost-effective for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention in average-risk populations </plain></SENT>
