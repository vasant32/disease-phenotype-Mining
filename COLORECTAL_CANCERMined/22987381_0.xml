<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the association between MSI status, hMLH1 protein expression and methylation status of the hMLH1 promoter in a cohort of Tunisian <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of MLH1 and MSH2 was determined by immunohistochemistry and the MSI status was analysed by microfluid-based on-chip electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the hMLH1 gene promoter was determined by methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 150 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> 57% were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>, 28% were MSI-L and 15%were MSI-H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were more frequently right-sided, exhibited a stage III of TNM and tended more to be mucinous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MSI status had no effect on overall patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>/MSI-L 79% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were unmethylated at the hMLH1 promoter, while 26% MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>84% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> and MSI-L expressed MLH1 and 52% of MSI-H expressed MLH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the methylated MSI-H cases, 35% expressed MLH1 protein while 100% of the unmethylated MSI-H were positive for MLH1 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 11 MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with loss of MLH1 expression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were also methylated while 50% MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with positive immunostaining for MLH1 were methylated at the hMLH1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study showed that MSI-H phenotype was mucinous, right-side and exhibit stade III of TNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The relative correlation of MLH1 expression and promotor hypermethylation of hMLH1 for the MSI status is similar to that reported for several study </plain></SENT>
