<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ecotropic virus integration site-1 (Evi-1) oncoprotein represses TGF-β signaling by interacting with Smads, but its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Evi-1 plays role(s) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and to characterize Evi-1 transcript(s) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evi-1 was overexpressed in 53% of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples, 100% of colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> samples, and 100% of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using 5' RACE, we cloned a novel Evi-1 transcript (Evi-1e) from a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue and found that this novel transcript was expressed at a higher level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and was the major Evi-1 transcript in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient Evi-1 transfection inhibited TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity and reversed the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β in MC-26 mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified overexpression of Evi-1 oncoprotein as a novel mechanism by which a subset of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> may escape TGF-β regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have also identified a novel Evi-1 transcript, Evi-1e, as the major Evi-1 transcript expressed in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
