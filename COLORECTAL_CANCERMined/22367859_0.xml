<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Patients who had a previous diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were searched retrospectively in our PET center database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT studies between October 2006 and December 2010 of 69 patients (25 women, 44 men; mean age: 61.61 ± 4.1 years) with elevated CEA levels were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT findings and concurrent abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ceCT) findings were compared with histopathological findings and/or clinical follow-up data as the 'gold standard' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the patient-based analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT in the detection of disease recurrence were calculated as 97 and 61%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference was found in frequencies of positive and negative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT findings between patients with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> by gold standard (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between patients' serum CEA levels and lesions' maximum standardized uptake values (P=0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of ceCT were computed as 51 and 60%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the evaluation of separate patient groups, although the sensitivity and specificity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT were calculated as 100 and 60% in the group whose CEA level elevation was less than two-fold (5-9.9 ng/ml), these were 100 and 75% in the group with CEA elevation less than three-fold (10-14.9 ng/ml) and 95 and 62% in the group with elevation more than three-fold (≥ 15 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT were computed as 98 and 85% in the lesion-based evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of ceCT were 73 and 86%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT is a safe imaging method that can be used in the determination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence in patients with elevated CEA levels, regardless of the CEA level </plain></SENT>
