<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested that the presence of occult nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (micrometastases) is related to adverse clinical course in stage I colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein we analyzed the correlation between nodal micrometastases and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) or lymphatic vessel density (LVD) in a series of stage I colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>; the cohort included cases characterized or not characterized by disease progression during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these cases, LVI and LVD were evidenced through the immunohistochemical detection of the specific marker for lymphatic vessels, D2-40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LVI was significantly more frequent in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> characterized by the presence of micrometastases (P&lt;0.0001), high peritumoral LVD (P&lt;0.0001), and disease progression (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis for progression risk indicated that nodal micrometastases and LVI were significant, negative, independent prognostic parameters associated with shorter disease-free survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677947" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage I colorectal cancer</z:e> (P=0.0001; P=0.0242) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this study we demonstrated for the first time that LVI is significantly associated with nodal occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in stage I colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the light of its significant, independent, prognostic value in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, the detection of LVI may represent a faster and cheaper tool compared with the time-consuming evaluation of micrometastases to select high-risk patients who may benefit from adjuvant systemic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the assessment of LVI may be applied to establish the likelihood of nodal involvement from <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> treated with conservative local excision techniques, which provide no regional nodes for histologic examination </plain></SENT>
