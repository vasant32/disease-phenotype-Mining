<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) is regarded as a hepatic manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether NAFLD is associated with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in Korean women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included data from 5517 women, aged 35-80 years, who underwent life insurance company health examinations between July 2002 and June 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>Fatty liver</z:hpo> disease was assessed by abdominal ultrasound, with NAFLD defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease in the absence of alcohol use of &gt; 40 g/week or other secondary causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> through December 2008 was obtained through medical certificate codes for insurance claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between NAFLD and the risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was estimated using standard Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the study population, 15.1% were diagnosed with NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 65 women were verified as having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and 15 as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjusted relative risks (95% confidence interval [CI]) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> by age, low <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi>, and NAFLD were 1.12 (95% CI 1.09-1.15), 2.56 (95% CI 1.53-4.28) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.11-3.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjusted relative risks (95% CI) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by age and NAFLD were 1.23 (95% CI 1.17-1.29) and 3.08 (95% CI 1.02-9.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:â€‚ Our findings demonstrate a significant relationship between NAFLD and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the various manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, NAFLD may predict the development of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in Korean women </plain></SENT>
