<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barriers to screening include cost, lack of health insurance, anticipation of pain, embarrassment, mistrust of medical/healthcare systems and institutions, a fatalistic belief system, as well as fear and lack of knowledge regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These barriers are significantly more problematic among Hispanics who are poor and those who live in underserved rural and border communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study addressed barriers by using promotoras and a home-based educational intervention to improve knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) among Hispanics in Yakima Valley, Washington </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study participants attended a promotora led home-based educational intervention consisting of home-health parties (HHPs) and completed baseline and follow-up surveys on general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> knowledge and knowledge specific to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and related screening practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results suggest increase in knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and participation in screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Promotora facilitated home-based interventions offer culturally appropriate ways to reach Hispanics in rural and other underserved communities to reduce barriers and improve access to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screenings </plain></SENT>
