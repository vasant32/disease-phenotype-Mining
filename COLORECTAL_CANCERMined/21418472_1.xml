<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surveillance following surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> aims to detect treatable disease relapse or metachronous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> have been reported within a short duration of follow-up, and may be due to missed lesions, seeding into polypectomy wounds or accelerated <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> related to genetic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to establish the timing and method of detection of metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in a large population of patients in a surveillance database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective clinical study used patients with an elevated risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> included in a colonoscopy-based surveillance programme to identify those with two or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, as well as the timing and method of detection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy reports and histopathology results were reviewed to determine quality of bowel preparation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, and polypectomy data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen (2.5%) of 569 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> developed metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e>, nearly half of which were identified within 3 years of follow-up by surveillance colonoscopy or an interval faecal immunochemical test for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of these had a previous polypectomy at the site of the second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, bowel preparation at the original colonoscopy was good in most cases, and no metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> occurred at a colonic flexure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> can occur early during follow-up after curative intent resection, and early colonoscopic surveillance may be warranted </plain></SENT>
