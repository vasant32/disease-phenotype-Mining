<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Uninsured patients have been shown to have lower rates of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that uninsured patients and patients with Medicaid present with more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to measure the effect of insurance status in the setting of a safety-net hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> registry with a diagnosis of breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 2001 and 2010 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of their insurance status, they were divided into the following groups: Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare age &lt; 65 years, commercial, uninsured, and unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> stage was recorded for each patient, with stages III and IV considered advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the rate of advanced disease in each patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 910 patients were included in the study: 836 (91.9%) insured, 54 (5.9%) uninsured, and 20 (2.2%) unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the insured patients, 301 (36.0%) had Medicaid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty-seven (30.7%) of 836 insured patients had advanced disease, compared with 27 (50.0%) of 54 uninsured patients (odds ratio, 1.63; P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of patients with Medicaid, 83 (27.6%) of 301 had advanced disease, which was not statistically different from patients with other insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a safety-net hospital, patients with Medicaid had rates of advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> similar to those in patients with other types of insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, patients with no insurance had significantly higher rates of advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This has significant ramifications in view of the new health care law, which will convert many patients from being uninsured to having Medicaid </plain></SENT>
