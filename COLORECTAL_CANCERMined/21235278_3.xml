<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">Butyrate</z:chebi> in particular is the preferred energy source for the cells in the colonic mucosa and has been demonstrated to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used proteomics, specifically 2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry, to identify proteins involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HCT116 cells and also to identify proteins involved in the development of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> insensitivity in its derivative, the HCT116-BR cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HCT116-BR cell line was characterized as being less responsive to the apoptotic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> in comparison to its parent cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our analysis has revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> likely induces a cellular stress response in HCT116 cells characterized by p38 MAPK activation and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, resulting in caspase 3/7 activation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adaptive cellular responses to stress-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HCT116-BR cells may be responsible for the development of resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also report for the first time additional cellular processes altered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> biosynthesis and dysregulated expression of nuclear lamina proteins, which may be involved in the apoptotic response observed in these cell lines </plain></SENT>
