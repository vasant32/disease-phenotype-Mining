<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> (P450) 2W1 is still considered an "orphan" because its physiological function is not characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify its substrate specificity, the purified recombinant enzyme was incubated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> extracts for untargeted substrate searches using an LC/MS-based metabolomic and isotopic labeling approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to previously reported fatty acids, oleyl (18:1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="11230">lysophosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (LPC, lysolecithin) was identified as a substrate for P450 2W1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other human P450 enzymes tested showed little activity with 18:1 LPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the LPCs, P450 2W1 acted on a series of other lysophospholipids, including lysophosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52288">lysophosphatidic acid</z:chebi> but not diacylphospholipids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P450 2W1 utilized sn-1 18:1 LPC as a substrate much more efficiently than the sn-2 isomer; we conclude that the sn-1 isomers of lysophospholipids are preferred substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chiral analysis was performed on the 18:1 epoxidation products and showed enantio-selectivity for formation of (9R,10S) over (9R,10S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kinetics and position specificities of P450 2W1-catalyzed oxygenation of lysophospholipids (16:0 LPC and 18:1 LPC) and fatty acids (C16:0 and C18:1) were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Epoxidation and hydroxylation of 18:1 LPC are considerably more efficient than for the C18:1 free fatty acid </plain></SENT>
