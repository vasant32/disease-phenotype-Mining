<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cetuximab (Erbitux(®)) was approved for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> in Japan in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To verify information on the safety in practical use of cetuximab, we conducted post-marketing surveillance in accordance with the conditions for approval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients to be treated with cetuximab were enrolled by the central enrolment method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on treatment status, and incidence and severity of adverse drug reactions were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The target number of patients was 1800 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2126 patients were enrolled from 637 institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 2006 patients analysed, 93.2% received cetuximab as third-line or later treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median duration of treatment was 15.3 weeks, and 11.1% of patients received treatment for &gt;48 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse drug reactions was 89.6%, of which ≥grade 3 was 21.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of infusion reactions was 5.7% (any grade), with 83.3% of them occurring at the first administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disorders</z:e> was 83.7% (any grade), and the time to event varied for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung diseases</z:hpo> was 1.2% (any grade) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Diarrhoea and haematotoxicity scarcely occurred with cetuximab alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this surveillance, the incidence and categories of adverse drug reactions are not distinct from previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although most patients received cetuximab as third-line or later treatment, treatment was maintained with a median duration of 15 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab treatment in practical use is considered to be well tolerated and clinically useful in Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
