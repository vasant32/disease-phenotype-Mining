<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined whether the level of Treg-mediated inhibition of antitumor immune responses in patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (metCRC) selected for liver resection is associated with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively and at follow-ups, we did flow-based phenotyping, examined antitumor immunity using <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) protein in the presence or absence of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(dim/-) cells (Tregs) and determined cytokine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) levels in patient blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 18 months post-surgery, 8 patients were disease free (7 alive and 1 dead of unrelated cause) and 10 had experienced disease recurrence (7 alive and 3 dead of metCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to surgery, the patients demonstrated Treg-mediated suppression of TNFα and IFNγ expression that could be perturbed through the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)/cAMP pathway and the immune suppression was significantly higher in the group that later developed disease recurrence (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the post-surgery plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) levels were related to the clinical outcome (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) levels of 280 ± 47 vs. 704 ± 153 pg/ml (mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) for disease free and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T-cell phenotyping revealed higher frequencies of COX-2(+) cells in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support the notion that the level of Treg-mediated suppression of adaptive antitumor immune responses at the time of surgery may influence later clinical outcome of metCRC and provide valuable prognostic information </plain></SENT>
