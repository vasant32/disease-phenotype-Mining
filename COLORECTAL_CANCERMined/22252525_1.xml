<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms of PAK1 that contributed to colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our immunohistochemistry showed that PAK1 expression was increased with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) progression through the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results suggested a relationship between PAK1 nuclear localization and the Dukes staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we showed that PAK1 knockdown decreased proliferation and delayed the G1/S cell-cycle transition, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, PAK1 knock-down downregulated c-Jun amino terminal kinases (JNK) activity and the levels of cyclinD1, CDK4/6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the JNK activity by chemical inhibitor (SP600125) significantly reduced the effects of PAK1 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> proliferation via accumulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that knockdown of PAK1 could enhance the chemosensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> through G1 arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which PAK1 induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> growth might involve activation of JNK as well as downregulation of PTEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Targeting PAK1 may represent a novel treatment strategy for developing novel chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
