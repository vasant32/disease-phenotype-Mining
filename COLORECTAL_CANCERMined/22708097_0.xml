<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the detection of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell molecular markers from localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the time-course of a surgical manipulation or surgical modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2010 to June 2010, samples from the peripheral blood and the inferior mesenteric vein were collected from 42 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751498" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the sigmoid</z:e> colon or rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative, intra-operative (both pre-mobilization and post-mobilization), and post-operative samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and cytokeratin-20 (CK20) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> detection rates were analyzed according to the time of blood sample collection, the surgical modality, and patient clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression rates before surgical resection did not differ between blood samples from the peripheral and inferior mesenteric veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The detection rate for CEA and CK20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> showed a tendency to increase after operative mobilization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-bearing bowel segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the cumulative detection rates for CEA and CK20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased significantly over the course of surgery (pre-mobilization vs. post-mobilization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative detection rate decreased significantly after surgical resection compared with the pre-operative rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was observed in the detection rates between different surgical modalities (laparoscopy vs. open surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that surgical manipulation has a negative influence on the dissemination of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells during operations on localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the type of surgical technique did not affect circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
