<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a population-based analysis, we investigated predictors of LOS and emergency readmission after the initial surgery episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-O2: C18-C20), diagnosed 2002-2008, were identified from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry Ireland, and linked to hospital in-patient episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For those who underwent colorectal resection, the associated hospital episode was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors predicting longer LOS (upper-quartile, &gt; 24 days) for elective and emergency admissions separately, and whether LOS predicted emergency readmission within 28 days of discharge, were investigated using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 8197 patients underwent resection, 63% (n = 5133) elective and 37% (n = 3063) emergency admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median LOS was 14 days (inter-quartile range (IQR) = 11-20) for elective and 21 (15-33) for emergency admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For both emergency and elective admissions, likelihood of longer LOS was significantly higher in patients who were older, had co-morbidities and were unmarried; it was reduced for private patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For emergency patients only the likelihood of longer LOS was lower for patients admitted to higher-volume hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Longer LOS was associated with increased risk of emergency readmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of patients stay in hospital for at least 25 days following colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over one third of resected patients are emergency admissions and these have a significantly longer median LOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patient- and health service-related factors were associated with prolonged LOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Longer LOS was associated with increased risk of emergency readmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cost implications of these findings are significant </plain></SENT>
