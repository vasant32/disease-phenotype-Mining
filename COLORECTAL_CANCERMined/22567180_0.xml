<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of pharmacogenetic markers associated with treatment response may enable doctor to plan more precise and effective treatment tailoring to individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A novel oligonucleotide microarray was developed to genotype 13 variations (DPYD*2, DPYD*5, DPYD*9, TYMS 6 bp Ins/Del, UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*27, UGT1A1*28, GSTP1 Ile105Val, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, MTHFR C677T, MDR1 C3435T/A, MDR1 G2677A/T and ERCC1 C118T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of genotypes obtained by microarray was assessed by independent sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>73 patients first diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were treated with FOLFOX4 chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genotypes were successfully called by microarray, and were consistent with those identified by independent sequencing except two TYMS 6 bp Ins/Del genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with CT or TT genotype exhibited a higher probability of response to treatment than those with CC genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other SNP was found to be associated with treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these SNPs showed no associations with gastrointestinal, hematological or neurological toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ERCC1 C118T may be a predictive marker of treatment response to 5-FU/<z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The microarray can significantly facilitate the process of detecting genetic variations and may help doctor plan more effective medication for individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
