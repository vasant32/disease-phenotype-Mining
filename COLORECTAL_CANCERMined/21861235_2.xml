<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to analyze the function of RhoGDI2 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), and to determine its possible signaling pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of RhoGDI2 was detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, and 20 matched pairs of fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues, and 120 cases of clinical paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, RT-PCR, or immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of activations of p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-MAPK, and p-MEK were then examined in RhoGDI2-overexpressing cells by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A series of assays were finally performed to evaluate the effect of RhoGDI2 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell behaviors in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RhoGDI2 expression was higher in highly metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines than in lowly metastatic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RhoGDI2 expression was up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or lymphatic metastatic tissues relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RhoGDI2 expression was correlated strongly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, differentiation, and Duke's stage (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower RhoGDI2 expression had better overall survival (P = 0.012), and RhoGDI2 could predict prognosis only in patients with early-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High levels of activations of p-PI3K and p-Akt were observed in RhoGDI2-overexpressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LY294002 inhibitor could abrogate the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in those cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of RhoGDI2 enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell proliferation, motility, and invasion in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Over-expression of RhoGDI2 is associated with poor overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, especially those presenting in early-stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RhoGDI2 contributes to cell proliferation, motility, and invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, at least in part, by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
