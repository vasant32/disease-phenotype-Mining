<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is partly due to KRAS and BRAF mutations, which are currently assessed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To improve patient selection, assessing mutation status in circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (CTCs), which possibly better represent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> than the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, could be advantageous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the feasibility of KRAS and BRAF mutation detection in colorectal CTCs by comparing three sensitive methods and compared mutation status in matching <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> and CTCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CTCs were isolated from blood drawn from 49 patients before liver resection using CellSearch™ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and CTCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations were assessed by co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR (Transgenomic™), real-time PCR (EntroGen™) and nested Allele-Specific Blocker (ASB-)PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 43 of the 49 patients, tissue <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA was of sufficient quantity and quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these 43 patients, discordance between primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e> was 23% for KRAS and 7% for BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA from CTCs was available from 42 of the 43 patients, in which ASB-PCR was able to detect the most mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inconclusive results in patients with low CTC counts limited the interpretation of discrepancies between tissue and CTCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Determination of KRAS and BRAF mutations in CTCs is challenging but feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the tested methods, nested ASB-PCR, enabling detection of KRAS and BRAF mutations in patients with as little as two CTCs, seems to be superior </plain></SENT>
