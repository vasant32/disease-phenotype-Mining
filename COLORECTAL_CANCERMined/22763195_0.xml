<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the therapeutic effect and complications of modified radiation fields (MRFs) with those of conventional pelvic radiation fields (CPRFs) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: From December 1996 to October 2009, a total of 160 patients with rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> who received total mesorectal excision and postoperative radiotherapy were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four patients were in the CPRFs group, and 66 were in the MRFs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose was 50 Gy per 25 fractions in the initial plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment volume and the volume of small bowel that received more than 15 Gy of the MRFs was smaller than that of the CPRFs (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rates of local recurrence, overall survival, and disease-free survival were not statistically significant between the MRFs and CPRFs groups (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a statistical difference (P &lt; .05) in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity, which included serious complications in the lower digestive tract (grade â‰¥3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The completion rate for the initial radiotherapy plan was higher in the MRFs group than in the CPRFs group (P = .027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CPRFs, MRFs manifested a lower incidence of complications and the same therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding will facilitate the clinical application of MRFs for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
