<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sentinel lymph node mapping identifies the node(s) that most accurately reflect the lymph node status of patients, and intensive techniques that improve staging can be focused on these nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ex vivo sentinel lymph node mapping in the staging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 125 patients from the Alava-Txagorritxu University Hospital Health Region (Alava), who were diagnosed prior to surgery with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> without distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> from September 2009 to December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo sentinel lymph node mapping with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> was use in these patients to study the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sentinel nodes</z:e> with multiple slices using immunohistochemical techniques and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comparative study was also performed based on a control group of 170 patients staged with conventional techniques, and involving a single slice and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sentinel lymph node identification rate was 98%, with 5.6% false negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upstaging occurred in 14.2% of cases compared to the group studied using conventional techniques (P=.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo sentinel lymph node mapping with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> accurately reflects the lymph node status of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This approach upstages patients classified as stages i and ii by conventional techniques to stage iii, indicating chemotherapy that may improve their prognosis </plain></SENT>
