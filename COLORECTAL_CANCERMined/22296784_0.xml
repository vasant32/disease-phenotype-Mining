<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While substantive epidemiological literature suggests that alcohol drinking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are potential risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), the possible interaction between the two has not been adequately explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a case-control study to examine if alcohol drinking is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and if such risk differs in people with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were identified between 1999 and 2003 in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were frequency-matched by age and sex with controls selected using random digit dialing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases (702) and controls (717) completed self-administered questionnaires assessing health and lifestyle variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Estimates of alcohol intake included types of beverage, years of drinking, and average number of alcohol drinks per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were estimated to investigate the associations of alcohol independently and when stratified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> status on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants (BMI â‰¥ 30), alcohol was associated with higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2-4.0) relative to the non-alcohol category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, 3 or more different types of drinks were associated with a 3.4-fold higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> relative to non-drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> also increased with drinking years and drinks daily among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no increased risk was observed in people without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The effect of alcohol of drinking on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> seems to be modified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
