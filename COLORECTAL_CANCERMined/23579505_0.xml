<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven randomized control trials involving 3058 individuals who reported VTE outcomes were identified, of whom 1677 were treated with laparoscopic therapy and 1381 underwent open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combined results of the individual trials showed no statistically significant difference in the odds ratio for overall VTE (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval, 0.33-1.23, P=0.18), as well as in subgroups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> prophylaxis between these 2 approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, laparoscopic resection could achieve similar outcomes in terms of the incidence of VTE, which are associated with long-term benefits of the patients </plain></SENT>
