<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and biologically poorly understood disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To tailor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment, it is essential to first model this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> by defining subtypes of patients with homogeneous biological and clinical characteristics and second match these subtypes to cell lines for which extensive pharmacological data is available, thus linking targeted therapies to patients most likely to respond to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied a new unsupervised, iterative approach to stratify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples into subtypes based on genome-wide <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By applying this stratification to several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line panels and integrating pharmacological response data, we generated hypotheses regarding the targeted treatment of different subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In agreement with earlier studies, the two dominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subtypes are highly correlated with a gene expression signature of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, further dividing these two subtypes using iNMF (iterative Non-negative Matrix Factorization) revealed five subtypes that exhibit activation of specific signaling pathways, and show significant differences in clinical and molecular characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we were able to validate the stratification on independent, published datasets comprising over 1600 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Application of this stratification to four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line panels comprising 74 different cell lines, showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtypes are well represented in available <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line panels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological response data for targeted inhibitors of SRC, WNT, GSK3b, aurora kinase, PI3 kinase, and mTOR, showed significant differences in sensitivity across cell lines assigned to different subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, some of these differences in sensitivity were in concordance with high expression of the targets or activation of the corresponding pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> samples of the same subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The stratification presented here is robust, captures important features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and offers valuable insight into functional differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By matching the identified subtypes to cell line panels that have been pharmacologically characterized, it opens up new possibilities for the development and application of targeted therapies for defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient sub-populations </plain></SENT>
