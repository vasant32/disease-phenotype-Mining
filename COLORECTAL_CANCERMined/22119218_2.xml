<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The correct examination of lymph nodes is decisive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> classification into stage 2 and stage 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this specialised population-based study was to investigate the influence of clinical factors and volume of surgical activity on lymph node assessment in France for patients diagnosed with localised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1997 to 2004, French <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">digestive cancer</z:e> registries recorded a total of 4197 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The volume of surgical activity was appreciated by the annual number of digestive surgery admissions in 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of having at least 12 lymph nodes examined after surgical resection was analysed using a multilevel logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 1900 patients had more than 12 lymph nodes examined (45.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with at least 12 lymph nodes examined after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> resection is directly associated with the volume of surgical activity within care centres for patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was no longer significant during the second period study (2001-2004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): This population-based study reports that only 55% of colorectal patients have a sufficient number of lymph nodes examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This insufficient number of examined lymph nodes could be considered as a potential prospect for increasing treatment quality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients in France </plain></SENT>
