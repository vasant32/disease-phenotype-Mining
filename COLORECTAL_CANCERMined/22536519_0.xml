<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a questionnaire to aid in the recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, as well as patient interest in their risk status within an open-access endoscopy center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was administered to new patients presenting for colonoscopy from May 2007 to February 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>287 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family history was evaluated using Amsterdam 1, II, and Revised Bethesda criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recognition of risk and referral for counseling was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients' interest to be contacted by a genetic counselor was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>13.2 % (38/287) of patients met Revised Bethesda criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, 18 (47.4 %) were previously told about their increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient who met Revised Bethesda criteria (2.6 %) was previously referred for genetics, whereas none of the 3 patients who met Amsterdam I or II criteria were referred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>23.7 % of high-risk patients did not want to be contacted if found to be at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In our open-access endoscopy system, a significant number of high-risk patients remain unidentified and underreferred for genetic counseling due to numerous barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our findings lend support to taking a public health approach to identifying those at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> by implementing universal screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
