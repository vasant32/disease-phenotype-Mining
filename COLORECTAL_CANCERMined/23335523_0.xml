<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 60 patients with MCRC who were treated with chemotherapy including bevacizumab in the first-line setting were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bevacizumab was administered along with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil7sol;leucovorin (5-FU/LV) to 44 patients, 57horbar;FU7sol;LV+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> to 8 patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> to 6 patients and 5-FU/LV to 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total number of the cycles received was 381 (median 6, range 17horbar;13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common bevacizumab-related toxicity was grade 1-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (28%) followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grade 1-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> was seen in 8% of the patients (no grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (ATE) were not observed, however 3 patients (5%) had experienced grade 3-4 venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients (5%) grade 1-2 wound complications were seen (<z:mp ids='MP_0002908'>delayed wound healing</z:mp> in the place of the venous access device in 2, and wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (GIP) was seen in 3 (5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients were treated by surgical intervention and one patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab is well tolerated when combined with various chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As bevacizumab is becoming widely used in the routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practice, further studies which investigate the mechanism of bevacizumab-associated toxicities are warranted to develop effective management strategies for these adverse events </plain></SENT>
