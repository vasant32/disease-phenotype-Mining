<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood pressure data at 0, 90, and 180 min after a total of 162 bevacizumab administrations in 81 advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were retrospectively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (30%) demonstrated an average temporary drop of 20 mmâ€‰Hg or more in systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We classified these 25 patients as group A and the others as group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median time-to-treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) was significantly longer in group A than in group B (291 vs 162 days; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the proportion of patients who required intervention with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> during bevacizumab treatment was significantly higher in group A than in group B (36% vs 4%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a temporary blood pressure drop after bevacizumab administration could be a predictive marker for bevacizumab treatment </plain></SENT>
