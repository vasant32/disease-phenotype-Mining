<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed a pooled data set consisting of data from 87 MCRC patients from two previous phase II studies (n=60) and a group given off-protocol treatment (n=27) following irinotecan-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-, and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall objective response rate to cetuximab plus irinotecan was 28.7%, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 months, and median overall survival was 12.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Objective response rate did not significantly differ between patients with a favourable response to previous irinotecan (n=23), stable disease (n=38), or progressive disease (n=26), with observed rates of 29.2%, 31.6%, and 23.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation coefficients (ρ) between the PFS of previous irinotecan-based chemotherapy and that of cetuximab plus irinotecan were quite low (ρ=0.067 and 0.057 in patients with previous irinotecan as first- and second-line therapies, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although exploratory nature and small sample size may be limitations of this study, these findings indicate that the efficacy of irinotecan plus cetuximab in MCRC patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS did not differ by previous sensitivity to irinotecan </plain></SENT>
