<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A given number of samples must be analysed in order to detect clinically relevant differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and controls, with adequate statistical power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From clinical proteomic profiling studies, expression data for each peak (protein or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) from two or more clinically defined groups of subjects are typically available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Typically, both exposure and confounder information on each subject are also available, and usually the samples are not from randomized subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the data is usually available in replicate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the design stage, however, covariates are not typically available and are often ignored in sample size calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This leads to the use of insufficient numbers of samples and reduced power when there are imbalances in the numbers of subjects between different phenotypic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A method is proposed for accommodating information on covariates, data imbalances and design-characteristics, such as the technical replication and the observational nature of these studies, in sample size calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It assumes knowledge of a joint distribution for the protein expression values and the covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When discretized covariates are considered, the effect of the covariates enters the calculations as a function of the proportions of subjects with specific attributes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This makes it relatively straightforward (even when pilot data on subject covariates is unavailable) to specify and to adjust for the effect of the expected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The new method suggests certain experimental designs which lead to the use of a smaller number of samples when planning a study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analysis of data from the proteomic profiling of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> reveals that fewer samples are needed when a study is balanced than when it is unbalanced, and when the IMAC30 chip-type is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The method is implemented in the clippda package and is available in R at: http://www.bioconductor.org/help/bioc-views/release/bioc/html/clippda.html </plain></SENT>
