<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, to elucidate the haplotype structures of the two closely related alpha-class genes GSTA1 and GSTA2, we screened for genetic variation in 214 Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By direct resequencing of the 5'-flanking region, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the exons, and their flanking introns for 107 patients, 29 and 27 variants were identified in GSTA1 and GSTA2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The known functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -567T&gt;G, -69C&gt;T, and -52G&gt;A in GSTA1*B were found at allele frequencies of 0.140 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the four major GSTA2 allelic variants reported previously (GSTA2*A, *B, *C, and *E), only GSTA2*B (frequency = 0.154), *C (0.706), and *E (0.140) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following linkage disequilibrium analysis, haplotypes of both genes were separately estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, rapid genotyping methods for 7 and 6 SNPs tagging common haplotypes of GSTA1 and GSTA2, respectively, were developed using the single-base extension assay, and an additional 107 patients were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, haplotype combinations of both genes were classified into 3 major types: GSTA1*A-GSTA2*C, GSTA1*A-GSTA2*B, and GSTA1*B-GSTA2*E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings will be useful in pharmacogenomic studies on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> including anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
