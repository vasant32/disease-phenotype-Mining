<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients underwent chemotherapy with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> + irinotecan regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The complications of the CV-port system were retrospectively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CV-port system was placed in a total of 101 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients received a total of 1035 courses of these regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight complications occurred in the 101 patients (7.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complications included three instances of catheter rupture, two thrombotic events around the catheter, and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> at the site of the port or catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The complications were identified after a median of nine courses (range 6-16) and 135 days after the placement of the CV-port system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six of the 101 patients switched their regimen from FOLFOX to another regimen, and 4 of these 66 patients (6.1%) experienced complications associated with the CV-port system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 25 subjects who were admitted to the hospital emergency wing during the chemotherapeutic regimens, and 4 of these patients (16%) had complications associated with the CV-port system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The complications of the CV-port system occurred at a defined rate, therefore the early diagnosis and the appropriate treatment to address these complications is crucial </plain></SENT>
