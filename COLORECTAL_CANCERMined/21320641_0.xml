<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are sparse data on the outcome of high-risk patients treated only by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected from 474 patients who underwent endoscopic resection for T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> from 1974-2002 at Neuperlach Hospital in Munich, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient files were reviewed, and patients or referring physicians were contacted to assess outcomes during a follow-up period of at least 24 months (n = 390) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathology and endoscopy factors associated with an unfavorable outcome (local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrence of tumors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 390 patients followed, 141 received oncologic surgery, and 249 did not; overall, 10% had an unfavorable outcome (39/390) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis revealed that lymphatic vessel infiltration, poor grading of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, and incomplete endoscopic resection were risk factors for unfavorable outcomes (odds ratios, 7.8, 3.4, and 2.6, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If these risk factors were applied to patients who did not receive oncologic surgery, negative predictive values for an unfavorable outcome were 94.6% for lymphatic vessel infiltration, 94.2% for poor grading of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, and 96.5% for incomplete endoscopic resection; positive predictive values were 44.4%, 42.9%, and 19.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> infiltration of lymphatic vessels is the greatest risk factor for an unfavorable outcome after endoscopic resection for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, its positive predictive value is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decision to perform surgery after endoscopic resection of T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> should be made on the basis of specific features of each patient </plain></SENT>
