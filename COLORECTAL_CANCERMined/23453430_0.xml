<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To evaluate the impact of preoperative radiation on pouch outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (CAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CAC patients who underwent restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) from 1984 to 2009 were identified from our registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of preoperative pelvic radiation for CAC or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751416" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pelvic cancer</z:e> on pouch related outcomes was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-three pouch patients with confirmed CAC were included (37 male, 58.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at pouch construction was 46.9Â±10.6years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were excluded due to the presence of persistent diverting ileostomy (n=2) or no follow-up (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 56 patients were analyzed, including 9 who received pelvic radiation prior to IPAA creation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative pelvic radiation was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was, however, no correlation between pelvic radiation and pouch/anal transitional zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, pouch stricture, pelvic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and pouch <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>/sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pouch failure occurred in 13 patients after a median follow-up of 66.4 (range: 2.7-322.2) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although a simple statistical analysis based on the number of patients with pouch failure did not achieve significance (4/9 vs. 9/47, P=0.19), Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a strong association between preoperative pelvic radiation and the risk for pouch failure (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients revealed that 3/7 patients (42.9%) with radiation and 3/17 (17.6%) without had pouch failure (P=0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Again, the association between pelvic radiation and pouch failure was confirmed using Kaplan-Meier analysis (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic radiation administered prior to IPAA creation appears to be associated with poor pouch outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Oncological benefits and pouch functional outcomes should be carefully balanced before pelvic radiation is considered prior to restorative proctocolectomy </plain></SENT>
