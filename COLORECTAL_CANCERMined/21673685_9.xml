<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NO16966 was a randomised, two-arm, non-inferiority, phase III comparison of XELOX vs FOLFOX4, which was subsequently amended to a 2 × 2 factorial design with further randomisation to bevacizumab or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A planned follow-up exploratory analysis of OS was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised 2034 patients (two-arm portion, n=634; 2 × 2 factorial portion, n=1400) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the whole NO16966 study population, median OS was 19.8 months in the pooled XELOX/XELOX-placebo/XELOX-bevacizumab arms vs 19.5 months in the pooled FOLFOX4/FOLFOX4-placebo/FOLFOX4-bevacizumab arms (hazard ratio 0.95 (97.5% CI 0.85-1.06)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the pooled XELOX/XELOX-placebo arms, median OS was 19.0 vs 18.9 months in the pooled FOLFOX4/FOLFOX4-placebo arms (hazard ratio 0.95 (97.5% CI 0.83-1.09)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FOLFOX4 was associated with more grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> than XELOX, and XELOX with more grade 3 diarrhoea and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome than FOLFOX4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Updated survival data from study NO16966 show that XELOX is similar to FOLFOX4, confirming the primary analysis of progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>XELOX can be considered as a routine first-line treatment option for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
