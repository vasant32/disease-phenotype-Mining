<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore designed a questionnaire consisting of items related to socio-demographic parameters, medical and family history and questions of awareness and knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> for use in a descriptive cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, 337 were found to be eligible for the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were age below 18 years, any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> history, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, current colorectal problems, history of any diagnostic or therapeutic interventions for colorectal diseases.<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants stated that they heard about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
