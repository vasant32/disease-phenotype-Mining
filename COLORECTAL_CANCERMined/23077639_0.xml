<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is actually an OV-gene therapy, which has much better antitumor effect than either gene therapy alone or virotherapy alone in our previously published papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is a modification of CTGVT by inserting a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) specific suppressor gene, ST13, into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specific oncolytic virus, the Ad·CEA·E1A(Δ24), to construct the Ad·(ST13)·CEA·E1A(Δ24) for increasing the targeting tropism to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and it was briefly named as CTGVT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although many studies on CEA promoter and ST13 gene were reported but no construct has been performed to combine both of them as a new strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) specific therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specificity, the antitumor effect of Ad·(ST13)·CEA·E1A(Δ24) was also excellent and got nearly complete inhibition (not eradication) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> xenograft since ST13 was an effective antitumor gene with less toxicity, and a Chinese patent (No. 201110319434.4) was available for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ad·(ST13)·CEA·E1A(Δ24) caused cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through P38 MAPK (i.e. P38) which upregulated CHOP and ATF2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> medicated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway was activated by the increase of caspase 9 and caspase 3 expression </plain></SENT>
