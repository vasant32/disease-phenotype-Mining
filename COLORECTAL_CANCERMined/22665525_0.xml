<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the p53-independent signaling mechanisms activated by irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional profiling of isogenic HCT116 p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and p53 null cells was carried out following treatment with the active metabolite of irinotecan, SN38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised analysis methods showed that p53 status had a highly significant impact on gene expression changes in response to SN38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis indicated that pathways involved in cell motility [adherens junction, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton] were significantly activated in p53 null cells, but not p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cells, following SN38 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In functional assays, SN38 treatment increased the migratory potential of p53 null and p53-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines, but not p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, p53 null SN38-resistant cells were found to migrate at a faster rate than parental drug-sensitive p53 null cells, whereas p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> SN38-resistant cells failed to migrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, cotreatment with inhibitors of the MAPK pathway inhibited the increased migration observed following SN38 treatment in p53 null and p53-mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53, SN38 promotes migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, and inhibiting MAPK blocks this potentially prometastatic adaptive response to this anticancer drug </plain></SENT>
