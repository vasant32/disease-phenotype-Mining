<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, one of the potential therapeutic targets for colorectal and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> has been identified, which is maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MELK is known as an embryonic and neural stem cell marker, and associated with the cell survival, cell proliferation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, SNU-503, which is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> cell line, was treated with radiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU), and elevation of the MELK expression level was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the cell line was pre-treated with small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) against MELK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> before treatment of radiation or 5-FU and its effects on cell cycle and proliferation were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that knockdown of MELK reduced the proliferation of cells with radiation or 5-FU treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, MELK suppression caused changes in cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MELK could be associated with increased resistance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells against radiation and 5-FU </plain></SENT>
