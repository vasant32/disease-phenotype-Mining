<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the ethical review board </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Archival dynamic contrast-enhanced CT data from 46 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, obtained as part of a research study, were analyzed retrospectively by using the distributed parameter, conventional compartmental, adiabatic tissue homogeneity, and generalized kinetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), permeability-surface area product, extraction fraction, extravascular extracellular volume (ve), and volume transfer constant (K(trans)) were compared by using the Friedman test, with statistical significance at 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following receiver operating characteristic analysis, parameters of the different kinetic models and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage were compared with respect to overall survival discrimination, with use of Kaplan Meier analysis and a univariate Cox proportional hazard model, with additional cross-validation and permutation testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Blood flow was lower with the distributed parameter model than with the conventional compartmental and adiabatic tissue homogeneity models (P &lt; .0001), and blood flow values determined with the conventional compartmental and adiabatic tissue homogeneity models were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was longer with the distributed parameter model than with the conventional compartmental and adiabatic tissue homogeneity models (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood volume, permeability-surface area product, and ve were higher with the conventional compartmental model than with the adiabatic tissue homogeneity, distributed parameter, or generalized kinetic models (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extraction fraction was higher with the distributed parameter model than with the adiabatic tissue homogeneity model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to 5-year overall survival, only the distributed parameter model-derived ve was predictive of 5-year overall survival with a threshold value of 15.48 mL/100 mL after cross-validation and permutation testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Parameter values differ significantly between models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the models investigated, the distributed parameter model was the best predictor of 5-year overall survival. Â© RSNA, 2013 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120186/-/DC1 </plain></SENT>
