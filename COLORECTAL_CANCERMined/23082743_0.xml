<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes both <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and self-DNA and it is abundantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the influences of both <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> DNA and specific short DNA sequences on TLR9-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> cell invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect of various DNA ligands on cellular invasion and on TLR9 and matrix metalloproteinase expression of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA-ligands described in this study include CpG-ODN M362, 9-mer (hairpin), human telomeric sequence h-Tel22 G-quadruplex, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> DNAs from Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the DNAs studied were demonstrated to induce invasion in the studied cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DNA-induced invasion was inhibited with a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor and partly also with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> suggesting that it could be mediated via MMP activation, endosomal signaling, and TLR9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, H. pylori DNA was shown to induce a more pronounced invasion in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> cell line than in the other cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> DNA as well as deoxynucleotides having stable secondary structures (i.e. hairpins or G-quadruplex structures) may serve as endogenous, invasion-inducing TLR9-ligands and promote local progression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in the alimentary tract </plain></SENT>
