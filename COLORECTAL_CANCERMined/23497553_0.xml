<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the theoretical predictions with the observed relation between Ks=mt/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29320">ca0</z:chebi> and km in a group of nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> forwhich dynamic scans were available, and Km was derived from conventional Patlak analysis. derived from conventional Patlak analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two lesion regions of interest (ROIs) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ca(t) was determined from a three-dimensionalROI in the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the correlation between Km and late standard uptake value (SUV) aswell as retention index was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, feasibility of the approach was demonstratedin a whole-body investigation.Results Patlak analysis yielded a mean Vr of Vr = 0.53±0.08 ml/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient averaged ¿a was 99±23 min.Linear regression between Patlak-derived Km and DTP-derived Ks according to Ks = b · Km + ayielded b = 0.98 ± 0.05 and a = -0.0054 ± 0.0013 ml/min/ml (r = 0.98) in full accordance withthe theoretical predictions b = 1 and a ¿ -Vr=¿a Ks exhibits better correlation with Km than lateSUV and retention index, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>K(c)s = Ks + Vr=¿a is proposed as a quantitative estimator ofKm which is independent of patient weight, scan time, and scanner calibration.Conclusion Quantification of Km from dual time point measurements compatible with clinical routine is feasible.The proposed approach eliminates the issues of static SUV and conventional DTP imaging regardinginfluence of chosen scanning times and inter-study variability of the input function </plain></SENT>
