<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed patient surveys and medical records for a population-based cohort with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated in multiple regions and health systems in the United States (US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and initiated first-line chemotherapy after US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) bevacizumab approval in February 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First-line bevacizumab therapy was defined as receiving bevacizumab within 8 weeks of starting chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated factors associated with first-line bevacizumab treatment using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 355 patients, 31% received first-line bevacizumab in the two years after FDA approval, including 26% of men, 41% of women, and 16% of those ≥ 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Use rose sharply within 6 months after FDA approval, then plateaued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>20% of patients received bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan; 53% received it with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men were less likely than women to receive bevacizumab (adjusted OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32-0.93; p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients ≥ 75 years were less likely to receive bevacizumab than patients &lt; 55 years (adjusted OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.04-0.46; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One-third of eligible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients received first-line bevacizumab shortly after FDA approval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most patients did not receive bevacizumab as part of the regimen used in the pivotal study leading to FDA approval </plain></SENT>
