<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were collected in the context of a randomized trial, which found that an individually tailored, multicomponent intervention was successful in increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening among first-degree relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The ethnically diverse study sample (N = 841; 29% Latino, 21% African American, 20% Asian) consisted of adult siblings and children (40-80 years) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases, identified through the California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in self-reported risk perception (perceived likelihood of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were examined over the study period in relation to study condition and screening status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Greater increases in perceived risk were observed among intervention versus control-group participants over the study period, but increases were limited to intervention participants who had not been screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also examined trajectories of perceived risk in relation to timing of screening receipt (e.g., before 6 months, 6-12 months, never) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continued upward shifts in risk were observed during the study period among intervention participants not screened during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, participants screened by 6 months displayed a reduction or leveling off in perceived risk between 6- and 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results provide support for the applicability of the Risk Reappraisal Hypothesis within a high-risk sample enrolled in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening promotion trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future research is needed to explore the impact of short-term risk reductions on future <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening behavior </plain></SENT>
