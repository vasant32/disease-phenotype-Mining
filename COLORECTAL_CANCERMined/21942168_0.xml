<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) rates among many American Indian populations are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening by fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and endoscopy is effective for reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality, but little research has examined the extent of such screening in reservation populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, nothing is known of how American Indians' cultural characteristics may be related to screening receipt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: We examined data from participants recruited from 2 Northern Plains and 1 Southwest reservation for the Education and Research Toward Health (EARTH) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants aged &gt; or = 51 years were eligible for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: After calculating screening rates, we examined bivariate relationships between screening and participant characteristics, including measures of cultural characteristics including ethnic identity and use of traditional healing practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We applied multivariate regression to relate these cultural variables to odds of lifetime screening by FOBT or endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 751 American Indians sampled, 35% reported lifetime <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening by at least one modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses did not reveal significant relationships or trends relating FOBT to respondents' cultural characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, odds of endoscopy were significantly lower among persons who spoke a tribal language at home (OR .6, 95% C.I. .4-.9), and trend analysis revealed an inverse relationship between endoscopy and number of identity measures endorsed (Ptrend&lt;.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The sampled population exhibits disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to the general population, and cultural characteristics are related to odds of endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Findings warrant culturally tailored <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening initiatives for American Indians </plain></SENT>
