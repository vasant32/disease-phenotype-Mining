<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (CTCs) has considerable utility in the clinical management of patients with solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CTCs and their low numbers in the bloodstream of patients means that no standardized detection method currently exists for these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This, together with differences in pre-analytical sample processing, has led to the collection and accumulation of inconsistent data among independent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we compare the ability of three methods to detect CTCs in the blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, different aliquots of the same blood sample were screened for the presence of CTCs by a multimarker RT-PCR assay, the standardized CellSearch assay and dHPLC-based gene mutation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the population tested, none of the blood samples analysed appeared to be positive by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the samples, 75% were positive for the presence of CTCs by the RT-PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 20% were positive by the CellSearch assay, while 14.3% of samples displayed gene mutations consistent with the presence of CTCs when the dHPLC method was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The samples which were positive for CTCs by the CellSearch assay did not overlap with those that were positive by dHPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these samples were positive when assessed by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, of the samples that resulted negative by RT-PCR analysis, none appeared to be positive by either of the other methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data, therefore, indicate that of the three methods tested, the multimarker RT-PCR assay provides maximal probability of CTC detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the preliminary results of an ongoing clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future follow-up involving detection of CTCs in the blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients using these three distinct methods will allow us to verify whether either a single method, or a combination of different assays, is necessary to uncover further prognostic significance of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
