<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This situation is in marked contrast to that of small-molecule targeted agents, such as inhibitors of ABL, EGFR, BRAF and MEK, in which mutations in the genes encoding the protein targets render the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> resistant to the effects of the drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The simplest hypothesis to account for the development of resistance to EGFR blockade is that rare cells with KRAS mutations pre-exist at low levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with ostensibly <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this hypothesis would seem readily testable, there is no evidence in pre-clinical models to support it, nor is there data from patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we determined whether mutant KRAS DNA could be detected in the circulation of 28 patients receiving monotherapy with panitumumab, a therapeutic anti-EGFR antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that 9 out of 24 (38%) patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were initially KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> developed detectable mutations in KRAS in their sera, three of which developed multiple different KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The appearance of these mutations was very consistent, generally occurring between 5 and 6 months following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mathematical modelling indicated that the mutations were present in expanded subclones before the initiation of panitumumab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the emergence of KRAS mutations is a mediator of acquired resistance to EGFR blockade and that these mutations can be detected in a non-invasive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They explain why <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> develop resistance to targeted therapies in a highly reproducible fashion </plain></SENT>
