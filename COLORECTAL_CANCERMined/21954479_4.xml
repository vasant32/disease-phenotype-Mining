<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare the prevalence and number needed to screen (NNS) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (AAs), and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) for different age groups in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cohort study of 44,350 participants in a national screening colonoscopy program over a 4-year period (2007 to 2010) in Austria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and NNS of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, AAs, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> in different age groups for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median ages were 60.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54.5-67.5 years) for women and 60.6 years (IQR, 54.3-67.6 years) for men, and the sex ratio was nearly identical (51.0% [22,598] vs 49.0% [21,572]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenomas</z:mpath> were found in 19.7% of individuals screened (95% CI, 19.3%-20.1%; n = 8743), AAs in 6.3% (95% CI, 6.1%-6.5%; n = 2781), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> in 1.1% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.2%; n = 491); NNS were 5.1 (95% CI, 5.0-5.2), 15.9 (95% CI, 15.4-16.5), and 90.9 (95% CI, 83.3-100.0), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male sex was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (24.9% [95% CI, 24.3%-25.4%] vs 14.8% [95% CI, 14.3%-15.2%]; P &lt; .001; unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.9 [95% CI, 1.8-2.0]), AAs (8.0% [95% CI, 7.6%-8.3%] vs 4.7% [95% CI, 4.4%-4.9%]; P &lt; .001; unadjusted OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.6-1.9]), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (1.5% [95% CI, 1.3%-1.7%] vs 0.7% [95% CI, 0.6%-0.9%]; P &lt; .001; unadjusted OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7-2.5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AAs in 50- to 54-year-old individuals was 5.0% (95% CI, 4.4%-5.6%) in men but 2.9% (95% CI, 2.5%-3.4%) in women (adjusted P = .001); the NNS in men was 20 (95% CI, 17.8-22.6) vs 34 in women (95% CI, 29.1-40; adjusted P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical significance between the prevalence and NNS of AAs in men aged 45 to 49 years compared with women aged 55 to 59 years (3.8% [95% CI, 2.3%-6.1%] vs 3.9% [95% CI, 3.3%-4.5%] and 26.1 [95% CI, 16.5-44.4] vs 26 [95% CI, 22.5-30.2]; P = .99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among a cohort of Austrian individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy, the prevalence and NNS of AAs were comparable between men aged 45 to 49 years and women aged 55 to 59 years </plain></SENT>
