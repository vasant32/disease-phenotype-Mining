<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Development of robust prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is imperative for advancing treatment strategies for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether expression status of certain miRNAs might have prognostic/predictive value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients treated with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a cohort of 273 CRC specimens from stage II/III patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based adjuvant chemotherapy and stage IV patients subjected to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a screening set (n = 44), 13 of 21 candidate miRNAs were successfully quantified by multiplex quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the validation set comprising of the entire patient cohort, miR-148a expression status was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, and its promoter methylation was quantified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we analyzed the associations between miR-148a expression and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the candidate miRNAs studied, miR-148a expression was most significantly down-regulated in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In stage III and IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, low miR-148a expression was associated with significantly shorter disease free-survival (DFS), a worse therapeutic response, and poor overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-148a methylation status correlated inversely with its expression, and was associated with worse survival in stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, miR-148a expression was an independent prognostic/predictive biomarker for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (DFS in stage III, low vs. high expression, HR 2.11; OS in stage IV, HR 1.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: MiR-148a status has a prognostic/predictive value in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients treated with conventional chemotherapy, which has important clinical implications in improving therapeutic strategies and personalized management of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
