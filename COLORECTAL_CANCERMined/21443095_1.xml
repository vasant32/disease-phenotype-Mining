<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the differences between the intestinal flora of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and healthy subjects and assessed the possibility of using probiotics to prevent colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The subjects were 10 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 20 healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A stool specimen and peripheral blood specimen were collected from the patients and 10 of the healthy subjects to analyze their intestinal flora and measure natural killer (NK) cell activity and IL-1 beta in their blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probiotics (Lactobacillus gasseri OLL2716: LG21) was then administered once daily to 10 of the healthy subjects for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples were collected after 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks of administration, and the same examinations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Lactobacillus detection rate was significantly higher in the healthy group than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> group, and the total Clostridium perfringens was higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stool pH of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> group indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo>, and the total amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short-chain fatty acids</z:chebi> in the stools tended to be lower than in the healthy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After ingestion of the probiotic, the Lactobacillus detection rate increased, a decrease in the total amount of Clostridium perfringens was seen, fecal pH indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, synthesis of fecal putrefaction products was inhibited, and an increase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short-chain fatty acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16135">isobutyric acid</z:chebi> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The blood IL-1 beta and NK cell activity values were significantly higher from the 4th week onward than the values before ingestion of probiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A deterioration of the intestinal environment was observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in comparison to the healthy controls, and the intestinal environment improved when probiotics was taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the possibility of preventing colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with probiotics </plain></SENT>
