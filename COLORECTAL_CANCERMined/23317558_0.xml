<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using data from 2 large National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute-sponsored clinical trials, we report on the dietary and lifestyle practices of patients receiving therapy for stage III colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires were completed by patients undergoing chemotherapy for stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (n = 1095) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (n = 875) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to evaluate anthropometrics, diet, and lifestyle in each cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median body mass index was comparable for stage III and metastatic patients (27.3 vs. 26.5 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stage III patients reported a modestly higher median level of physical activity than metastatic patients (4.6 vs. 3.4 metabolic equivalent task-hours per week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of stage III and 9% of metastatic patients reported ongoing cigarette use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Avoidance of alcohol was reported by 47% of stage III and 43% of metastatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dietary patterns for both groups were comparable with more than 80% of stage III and metastatic patients failing to meet the recommended daily intake of vegetables, fruits, and milk products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Usage of at least 2 multivitamins per week was reported by 49% of stage III and 40% of metastatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two percent of stage III and 5% of metastatic patients reported <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplement use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed notable similarities in dietary and lifestyle behaviors between stage III colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients actively receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future research should aim to elucidate the effect of these behaviors on patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
