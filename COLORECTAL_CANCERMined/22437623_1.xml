<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: : Substantial regional variations in health-care spending exist across the United States; yet, care and outcomes are not better in higher-spending areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies have focused on care in fee-for-service Medicare; whether spillover effects exist in settings without financial incentives for more care is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: : We studied care for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients in fee-for-service Medicare and the Veterans Health Administration (VA) to understand whether processes and outcomes of care vary with area-level Medicare spending </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: : An observational study using logistic regression to assess care by area-level measures of Medicare spending </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: : Patients with lung, colorectal, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> diagnosed during 2001-2004 in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) areas or the VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SEER cohort included fee-for-service Medicare patients aged older than 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: : Recommended and preference-sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : In fee-for-service Medicare, higher-spending areas had higher rates of recommended care (curative surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> and chemotherapy for stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>) and preference-sensitive care (chemotherapy for stage IV lung and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and primary treatment of local/regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>) and had lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the VA, we observed minimal variation in care by area-level Medicare spending </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: : Our findings suggest that intensity of care for Medicare beneficiaries is not driving variations in VA care, despite some overlap in physician networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the Dartmouth Atlas work has been of unprecedented importance in demonstrating variations in Medicare spending, new measures may be needed to better understand variations in other populations </plain></SENT>
