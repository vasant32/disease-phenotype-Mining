<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of treatment success depends on early disease detection and timely, effective delivery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> specific treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are many ongoing researches aimed to improve diagnostics or treatment, but the option to use both modalities concomitantly is deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this project we are using the advances in nanotechnology to develop new theranostic tool using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50595">single walled carbon nanotubes</z:chebi> (SWCNT) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">Quantum dots</z:chebi> (QDs) for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell detection, and option to deliver targeted treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Method: SWCNTs were refluxed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25942">HNO3</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26836">H2SO4</z:chebi> (1:3) at 120 Â°C for 120 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functionalised SWCNT was then covalently attached to octa-<z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), QDs and conjugated with antibodies for targeted cell detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV/NIR analysis, Raman and UV-VIS spectroscopy were used in order to prove the successful conjugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicology study using alamar blue analysis and DNA assay was conducted in order to choose the best concentration of SWCNT, octa-<z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi>-POSS and QDs before commencing the conjugation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line HT29, <z:mp ids='MP_0009153'>pancreas cancer</z:mp> cell line PANC-1 and mouse fibroblasts 3T3 were then treated with or without antibody conjugated SWCNT-POSS-QDs (CPQ) compound solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cell response was observed under the microscope after 24, 48 and 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results: FTIR and Raman spectroscopies confirmed covalent binding of the SWCNTs to Octa-<z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">Ammonium</z:chebi>-POSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was supported by TEM images and photos obtained, which showed well dispersed SWCNTs following its treatment with Octa-<z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">Ammonium</z:chebi>-POSS compared to pristine SWCNT samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>UV-VIS graphs determined the presence of antibody within the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>UV/NIR demonstrated QD fluorescence even after attachment of SWCNT-POSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cellular behaviour revealed high CPQ-antibody complex affinity towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells when compared to healthy cell line which internalised the complex only on day three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0009153'>pancreas cancer</z:mp> cell line had appearance of lysed pulp after 72 hours of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colonic cancer</z:e> cells seemed to regain ability to populate from day three signifying that higher treatment payload is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: We have successfully manufactured novel compound consisting of Octa-<z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">Ammonium</z:chebi>-POSS linked SWCNTs, QDs, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The complex has proven its potential as cell probing tool, and the attachment of antibodies has shown high affinity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells rendering this an attractive model for further theranostic developments </plain></SENT>
