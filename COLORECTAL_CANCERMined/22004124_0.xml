<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: For large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, the en bloc resection rate achieved by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is insufficient, and this leads to a high rate of local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been reported to achieve a higher rate of en bloc resection and a lower rate of local recurrence in the short-term, it is expected to overcome the limitations of EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a matched case-control study between ESD and EMR to clarify the effectiveness of ESD for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 2005 and February 2009, a total of 28 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in 28 patients were resected by ESD and were followed up by colonoscopy at least once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a control group, 56 EMR cases from our prospectively completed database were matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>En bloc resection, complication and recurrence rates were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean sizes of the lesions were 27.1 mm in the ESD group and 25.0 mm in the EMR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The en bloc resection rate was significantly higher in the ESD group (92.9% vs 37.5% with ESD vs EMR), and the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was also significantly higher (10.7% vs 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> were managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No recurrence was observed in the ESD group, whereas local recurrences were detected in 12 EMR cases (21.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 12 recurrences (91.7%) were managed endoscopically, and one required surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a promising technique for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, giving an excellent outcome in comparison with EMR </plain></SENT>
