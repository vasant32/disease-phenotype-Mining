<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that the level before curative surgery is a prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the plasma D-dimer level before systemic chemotherapies is a predictor for advanced or recurrent unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 42 patients treated with systemic chemotherapies for advanced or recurrent unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variables including clinicopathological factors, plasma D-dimer levels and the modified Glasgow Prognostic Factor Score (mGPS) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma D-dimer level was closely related to the mGPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was shorter for patients with plasma D-dimer levels &gt;5 Âµg/ml than for those with lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with an mGPS of 0 or 1, an mGPS of 2 was predictive of poor prognosis (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Old age, advanced stage, plasma D-dimer level and mGPS were significantly associated with mortality, but plasma D-dimer level was the only independent risk factor in multivariate analysis, and was significant related to the clinical response to chemotherapy (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Survival was significantly shorter in patients with elevated plasma D-dimer levels having advanced or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The plasma D-dimer level before systemic chemotherapies was an independent mortality predictor </plain></SENT>
