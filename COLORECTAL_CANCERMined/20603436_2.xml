<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: the interplay between comorbidity, age and performance status (PS) as predictors of outcome in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (ACRC) is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined these factors as predictors of treatment toxicity and outcome in cetuximab-treated patients with ACRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: comorbidity was independently evaluated using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), a validated measure of comorbidity based on the presence of medical conditions weighted according to their effect on mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCI score was correlated with clinical and outcome data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: five hundred and seventy-two patients were included; 41% were ≥ 65 years and 25% had comorbidities at randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis (MVA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> covariates, only older age was associated with greater comorbidity (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) was significantly better for patients with greater comorbidity in univariate analysis (P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, better PS was associated with better OS in MVA (hazard ratio 1.92 for PS = 2 versus PS = 0, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age was not associated with OS (P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients had significantly less grade ≥ 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (P = 0.034) but more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with greater comorbidity had significantly less grade ≥ 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (P =  0.002) but more non-neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: better PS was associated with improved OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients with good PS, restricting cetuximab use in the setting of significant comorbidity does not appear justified </plain></SENT>
