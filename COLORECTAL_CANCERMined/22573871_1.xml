<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need for identifying novel targets to develop more sensitive, reliable, and specific tests for early stage detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-translational modifications are known to play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> and immune surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared the N-glycan profiles from 13 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and corresponding control colon tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> were enzymatically released, purified, and labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30754">2-aminobenzoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aliquots were profiled by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC-HPLC) with fluorescence detection and by negative mode MALDI-TOF-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using partial least squares discriminant analysis to investigate the N-glycosylation changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, an excellent separation and prediction ability were observed for both HILIC-HPLC and MALDI-TOF-MS data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For structure elucidation, information from positive mode ESI-ion trap-MS/MS and negative mode MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS was combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the features with a high separation power, structures containing a bisecting GlcNAc were found to be decreased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, whereas sulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, paucimannosidic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> containing a sialylated Lewis type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> were shown to be increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
