<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway occur in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>), and these mutations lead to increased nuclear accumulation of the β-catenin transcriptional co-activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the nucleus, β-catenin associates with TCF/LEF sequence specific transcription factors to activate target gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Hippo pathway restricts cellular growth by preventing nuclear accumulation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional co-activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>YAP expression is elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> suggesting that, like Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the Hippo pathway may contribute to colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regulation of YAP at the post-translational level has been well studied but the transcription factors that control YAP gene expression are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that β-catenin/TCF4 complexes bind a DNA enhancer element within the first intron of the YAP gene to drive YAP expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As such, reducing β-catenin expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells using shRNAs leads to decreased YAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>YAP is abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of several established human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines and this localization pattern is insensitive to plating density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that YAP expression is elevated in the majority of a panel of primary human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> compared with its expression in uninvolved colonic mucosa, and that YAP and β-catenin localize to the nuclear compartment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these results implicate YAP as an oncogene whose expression is driven by aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
