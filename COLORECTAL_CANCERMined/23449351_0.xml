<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median biomarker baseline levels determined cutoff values for the patient subgroups.Results:Baseline data were available for 88-97% of patients/study (&gt;2000 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both the studies, high baseline VEGF and CEA were associated with worse outcomes for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) independent of treatment (HORIZON II OS: VEGF, hazard ratio (HR)=1.35 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.63); CEA, HR=1.63 (1.36-1.96); HORIZON III OS: VEGF, HR=1.32 (1.12-1.54); CEA, HR=1.50 (1.29-1.76)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>sVEGFR-2 was not prognostic for PFS/OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline VEGF and CEA were not predictive for PFS/OS outcome to cediranib treatment; low sVEGFR-2 was associated with a trend towards improved cediranib effect in HORIZON II.Conclusion:Baseline VEGF and CEA levels were treatment-independent prognostic biomarkers for PFS and OS in both the studies </plain></SENT>
