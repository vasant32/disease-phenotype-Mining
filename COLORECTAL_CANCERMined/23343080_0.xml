<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">Chlorambucil</z:chebi> (CBL), an ancient direct-acting alkylating anticancer agent, is commonly used for initial treatment of some kinds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> but the use of CBL is often limited because of the unpleasant side effects due to its lack of specificity for targeting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this research we tried to increase the specificity of CBL by producing a novel conjugate by using glutamine amino acid (Glut) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on previous studies, poly <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> and nitrogen compounds noticeably are used by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells increasingly; therefore we decided to increase the efficiency and specificity of CBL by designing and producing a novel anti <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> conjugate using glutamine amino acid as an uptake enhancer, CBL, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30832">Adipic acid</z:chebi> Dihydrazide (ADH) as a spacer and linker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biological tests were carried out on HT29 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line to evaluate its anticancer properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biological tests like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, finding IC50, evaluating the induced mechanism of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of our novel CBL-Glutamine conjugate on HT29 cells, testing abnormal toxicity of this conjugate on mice in comparison with CBL drug were careid out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that not only CBL-Glutamine conjugate preserved its anti <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> property with regard to CBL drug, but also it represent lower abnormal toxicity in mice </plain></SENT>
