<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>Inguinal hernias</z:hpo> are one of the most common subjects in surgical practice and have been known to be associated with some other pathologies since 1831 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there are some series in literature reporting the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>inguinal hernias</z:hpo>, it is still controversial to perform colorectal diagnostic tools in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancers</z:e> are particularly accused to be in association with synchronous bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> as they increase the intra-abdominal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rectosigmoidoscopy was performed in 110 consecutive bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> patients and the results were recorded prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients having colorectal diseases were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no pathologies in 87 (%79,1) rectosigmoidoscopies, while benign pathologies (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e>) were diagnosed in 23 (%20,9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It has not been proved yet that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> increase the incidence of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>inguinal hernias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of benign pathologies in our series was similar to that of same age population without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a conclusion of this study we believe that rectosigmoidoscopy is not necessary for synchronous bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> unless the patient has any complaints or risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Colorectal screening tools are performed when the clinical findings or the story of the patient support <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>) (Tab </plain></SENT>
