<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated changes in colonoscopy adherence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening attitudes in 78 cancer-unaffected relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> mutation carriers before pre-test genetic counseling (baseline) and at 6 and 12 months post-disclosure of test results (52 mutation negative and 26 mutation positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While both groups were similar at baseline, at 12 months post-disclosure, a greater number of mutation-positive individuals had had a colonoscopy compared with mutation-negative individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From baseline to 12 months post-disclosure, the mutation-positive group demonstrated an increase in mean scores on measures of colonoscopy commitment, self-efficacy, and perceived benefits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, and a decrease in mean scores for perceived barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean scores on colonoscopy commitment decreased from baseline to 6 months in the mutation-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To conclude, adherence to risk-appropriate guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surveillance improved after genetic counseling and testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation-positive individuals reported increasingly positive attitudes toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening after receiving genetic test results, potentially reinforcing longer term colonoscopy adherence </plain></SENT>
