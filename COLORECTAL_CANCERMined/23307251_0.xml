<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the both values of neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in patients with initially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) were investigated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples were collected from 243 patients who were initially diagnosed with mCRC between 2005 and 2010 in the Sun Yat-sen University <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated NLR (p &lt; 0.001), PLR (p = 0.008), and CEA (p &lt; 0.001) were identified as statistically significant poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), while only NLR (p = 0.029) and CEA (p &lt; 0.001) were validated as independent predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis identified elevated NLR (p &lt; 0.001), PLR (p = 0.023), and CEA (p &lt; 0.001) as statistically significant poor predict factors for the progression-free survival (PFS) of first-line chemotherapy, while NLR (p = 0.013) and CEA (p = 0.001) were independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed significantly different OS (p &lt; 0.001) and PFS (p &lt; 0.001) among patients who had elevations in both NLR and CEA levels and those having one elevation or neither elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NLR, PLR, and CEA were significant predictors of OS and PFS in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, only NLR and CEA play as independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When coupled with CEA, NLR may lead to improved prognostic predictors </plain></SENT>
