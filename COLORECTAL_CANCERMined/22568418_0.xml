<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to examine how hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgeons approach the management of patients with hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (HCCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A web-based survey utilizing 10 clinical scenarios was distributed by e-mail to 37 HPB surgeons in Ontario, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study region has a population of approximately 13 million people and a universal, single-payer health care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Descriptive analyses were used to tabulate results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two (59%) surgeons responded to the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority (19/22, 86%) of respondents favoured neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with multiple synchronous and unilobar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>; only nine of 22 (41%) respondents favoured neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with a single synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the setting of residual resectable disease following downstaging chemotherapy, 77% (17/22) of surgeons advocated hepatic resection with either radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or wedge resection of the 'ghost' lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over 80% of surgeons would perform a liver and pulmonary resection in a patient with hepatic and multiple unilobar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None would offer liver resection to patients with multiple retroperitoneal node involvement, although 55% (12/22) would do so if a single retroperitoneal node was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperative portal vein embolization was favoured over RFA in patients with a small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and inadequate functional hepatic volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Notable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was observed among Ontario's HPB surgeons in approaches to HCCM </plain></SENT>
