<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) patterns of chromosome 7 disomy with efficacy of cetuximab therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We detected the EGFR FISH patterns and KRAS status in 74 tumors from cetuximab-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and analyzed with response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One of the 16 (6.25%) patients with chromosome 7 homogeneous disomy (defined as FISH negative) had objective response to cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 53(76.8%) patients with chromosome 7 pattern of variable ratios of disomy versus polysomy (defined as FISH positive) had a significantly higher RR (37.7% versus 6.25%; P = 0.01), a trend towards longer PFS (4.5 versus 2.9 months; P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 54 KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients, EGFR FISH-positive patients had significantly higher RR (51.3% versus 9%; P = 0.01) and longer PFS (5.0 versus 2.3 months; P = 0.02) than EGFR FISH-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, among 20 KRAS mutant-type patients, there was no difference in RR (0% versus 0%) and PFS (2.5 versus 3.8 months; P = 0.51) between EGFR FISH-positive and -negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show firstly that patients with EGFR FISH pattern of chromosome 7 disomy have a very low chance to benefit from cetuximab-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGFR FISH pattern of chromosome 7 disomy may be as a negative predicative factor for cetuximab response in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
