<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a promising technique to treat early colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> by facilitating en bloc resection without size limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although ESD for early gastrointestinal epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> has been popular in Japan, clinical experience with colorectal ESD has been rarely reported in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From March 2006 to December 2011, 92 consecutive patients with early colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> resected by ESD at Tri-Service General Hospital were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ESD was performed for colorectal epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with a noninvasive pit pattern which had the following criteria: (1) lesions difficult to remove en bloc with a snare, such as laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>-nongranular type (LST-NG) ≧20 mm and laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>-granular type (LST-G) ≧30 mm; (2) lesions with <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> or which had recurred after endoscopic mucosal resection with a nonlifting sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 66.3 ± 12.9 years, and the male-female ratio was 1.8 : 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 37.2 ± 17.9 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The en bloc resection rate was 90.2% and the R0 resection rate was 89.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforations</z:mpath> during ESD occurred in 11 patients (12.0%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were effectively treated by endoscopic closure with hemoclips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related morbidities or mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ESD is an effective method for en bloc resection of large early colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and those with a nonlifting sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An endoscopic technique to close <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> is essential for colorectal ESD </plain></SENT>
