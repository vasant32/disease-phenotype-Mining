<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a pilot study of five patients with newly diagnosed and untreated metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was confirmed by histopathological analysis before enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent F-5-FU PET/CT scanning before treatment and at approximately 24 h postbevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET/CT scanning consisted of a dynamic acquisition of images taken 0-20 min after injection of radiotracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of F-5-FU activity at the metastatic sites was assessed using visual interpretation and semiquantitative standardized uptake value analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sizes of the metastatic lesions ranged from the smallest lesion measuring 3.04 × 1.50 cm to the largest measuring 4.19 × 2.76 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By drawing regions of interest, time-activity curves were generated at each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site and area under the curve (AUC) analyses were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At baseline, during the first 5 min after F-5-FU injection the mean AUCtumor/AUCaorta ratio was 1.24 ± 0.30 (range, 0.424-2.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Less than 24 h after the administration of bevacizumab, the AUCtumor/AUCaorta ratio decreased to 1.06 ± 0.32 (range, 0.23-2.13, P=0.04), which represented an average decline of 20.2% (range, 0.4-45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radiotracer uptake on the 5, 10, 15, and 20-min images did not show any significant change between baseline and posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CT imaging showed stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size in one patient and a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> size in the remaining four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this pilot study of five patients with metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, F-5-FU PET/CT scanning showed a significant perfusion-related decrease in tracer activity 24 h postbevacizumab </plain></SENT>
