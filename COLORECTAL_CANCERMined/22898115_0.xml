<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the prevalence of physicians offering nonrecommended breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening for young women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The goal of the current paper was to examine the percentage of primary care physicians nationally who self-report offering breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests for young women, and physician/practice characteristics associated with such recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analysis was performed in 2011 on data from a 2008 cross-sectional survey presenting a vignette of a health maintenance visit by an asymptomatic woman aged 35 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study included surveys sent to 1546 U.S. family physicians, general internists, and obstetrician-gynecologists aged &lt;65 years, randomly selected from the AMA Physician Masterfile (60.6% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relevant respondent subsamples were used for the breast (n=505) and colorectal (n=721) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were weighted to represent physicians nationally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was physician self-report of offering breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 75.3% (95% CI =71.0%, 79.2%) of physicians offered <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening tests; most commonly these physicians reported offering mammography alone (76.5%, 95% CI= 71.6%, 80.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 39.3% (95% CI=35.5%, 43.2%) of physicians offered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests; most commonly these physicians reported offering FOBT alone (43.3%, 95% CI=37.2%, 49.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In adjusted analysis, physician factors associated with offering breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests were: estimating higher patient breast/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, and not <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preventive Services Task Force as a top influential organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of physicians report offering nonrecommended breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests for young women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Physicians' higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-risk estimation accounted for some overscreening, but even physicians who estimated the patient to be at the same risk as the general population reported offering nonrecommended screening tests </plain></SENT>
