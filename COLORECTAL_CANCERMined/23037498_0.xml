<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is an important agent in the oncologic armamentarium, with activity in a broad spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been approved in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740457" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">renal cancers</z:e>, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> multiforme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the published literature and briefing documents of the US Food and Drug Administration that provided the data leading to approval or change in approval status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bevacizumab initially received accelerated approval for the treatment of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, lack of confirmatory data from additional clinical trials resulted in the loss of that indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the expected and unexpected toxicities reported from clinical trials using bevacizumab have helped us to understand the drug's mechanism of action and to identify who are most likely to benefit from this important agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The side effects of treatment may provide important information about drug mechanism and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab is clearly an important agent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> and is likely to become more significant once a clinical or pathological marker to predict its efficacy has been identified </plain></SENT>
