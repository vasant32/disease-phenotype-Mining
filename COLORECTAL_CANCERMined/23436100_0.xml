<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether the use of stents as a bridge to surgery negatively affect the long-term outcome compared to curative surgery for left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2004 and December 2009, patients with left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> obstruction without distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients underwent radical resection after preoperative stent insertion (stent group), whereas 48 underwent emergency surgery with curative intent (surgery group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The short- and long-term outcomes between the two groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The stent and surgery groups had similar demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in primary anastomosis, laparoscopic-assisted surgery, operation time, time until first defecation and oral intake after surgery, postoperative hospital stay, and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stent group had an average hospital stay 7 days longer than the surgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the median follow-up period of 48.1 months, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were not significantly different between the stent and surgery groups (47.2 vs. 48.9 %, respectively; p = 0.499) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the 5-year survival rate was also similar in the two groups (70.4 vs. 76.4 %, respectively; p = 0.941) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> obstruction, stent insertion followed by surgery showed short-term advantages and similar oncologic outcomes compared to surgery without preoperative intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stent insertion as a bridge to surgery is a safe and feasible treatment option for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> obstruction </plain></SENT>
