<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> is a highly regulated mechanism of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> where pro-apoptotic proteins and caspases play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of pro-caspases at a definite time is essential to control the whole caspase cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrion contains some pro-apoptotic proteins, which need to come out in cytoplasm for apoptotic function such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">Cytochrome c</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">Cyt</z:chebi> c), while the Bcl-2 protein family works as the guard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane and prevents the escape of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">Cyt</z:chebi> c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">Cyt</z:chebi> c is out in cytoplasm, it binds with Apaf-1 (another pro-apoptotic protein also essential for proper cell differentiation) and pro-caspase-9, forming the Apoptosome complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the role of two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">Diclofenac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi>, in experimentally induced early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> of colon via apoptosome mechanism had been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been recognized that the prolonged use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> has its effect on reducing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> through apoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> in respect of apoptosome is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed, along with morphological and histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the expression levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">Cytochrome c</z:chebi>, Apaf-1, Caspases, and Bcl-2, it was observed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> do follow the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> or intrinsic pathway of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">Diclofenac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> on the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins have been observed, which may constitute the mechanism by which the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> are efficient in controlling the proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in the colon </plain></SENT>
