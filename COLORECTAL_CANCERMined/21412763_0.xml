<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Existing evidence is inconclusive on whether socioeconomic status (SES) and educational inequalities influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk, and whether low or high SES/educational level is associated with developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between educational level and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied data from 400,510 participants in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition) study, of whom 2,447 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (colon: 1,551, rectum: 896, mean follow-up 8.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard regression analysis stratified by age, gender and center, and adjusted for potential confounders were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative indices of inequality (RII) for education were estimated using Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conducted separate analyses for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, gender and geographical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with participants with college/university education, participants with vocational secondary education or less had a nonsignificantly lower risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When further stratified for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, adjusted risk estimates for the proximal colon were statistically significant for primary education or less (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.57-0.94) and for vocational secondary education (HR 0.76, 95%CI 0.58-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inverse association between low education and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was particularly found in women and Southern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These associations were statistically significant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and for proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, especially in the proximal colon, is lower in subjects with a lower educational level compared to those with a higher educational level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association is most pronounced in women and Southern Europe </plain></SENT>
