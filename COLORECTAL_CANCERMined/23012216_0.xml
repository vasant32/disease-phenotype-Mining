<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is increasingly being used to resect early colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, despite the technical difficulties associated with the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic-assisted colorectal surgery (LAC) is an alternative to open surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, and ESD was recently introduced as another alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared ESD with LAC as minimally invasive treatments for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 589 patients (297 patients with colorectal intramucosal or slightly submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancers</z:e> undergoing ESD; 292 patients with T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> undergoing LAC) who were treated at National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, between January 1998 and September 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes of ESD and LAC were evaluated retrospectively and compared on the basis of data that were originally collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the ESD group, mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 37 mm, mean procedure time was 106 minutes, and the en bloc and curative resection rates were 87 % and 80 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> (4.7%) and 5 cases of postprocedure <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (1.7%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> complications were successfully managed endoscopically except for one of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath>, which required emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the LAC group, mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 20 mm, mean operation time was 206 minutes, and complications included 31 wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, 2 pelvic abscesses, 3 anastomotic leakages, and 1 anastomotic bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stomas were necessary in 93 % of the patients who underwent LAC for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> located below the peritoneal reflection.Conclusions: ESD was associated with a lower complication rate than LAC, with favorable en bloc and curative resection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The safety profile and possibility of curative treatment with colorectal ESD provide advantages for the treatment of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> with nul risk of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
