<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NGAL also has important biological functions involved in immunity and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as well as responses to kidney damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NGAL expression has also been associated with certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and is important in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> patients have elevated levels of NGAL in their urine and it has been proposed that NGAL may be a prognostic indicator for certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (e.g. breast, brain, and others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NGAL expression is detected in response to various chemotherapeutic drugs including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and docetaxel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were interested in the roles of NGAL expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and whether it is associated with chemotherapeutic drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether increased NGAL expression led to resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells (MCF-7), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells (HT-29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We infected the various cell lines with a retrovirus encoding NGAL which we constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased NGAL expression was readily detected in the NGAL-infected cells but not the empty vector-infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, increased NGAL expression did not alter the sensitivity of the cells to the chemotherapeutic drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, although NGAL expression is often detected after chemotherapeutic drug treatment, it by itself, does not lead to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
