<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the prevalence of familial risk and its association with the occurrence of pathological significant lesions in subjects with positive faecal occult blood testing leading to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Faecal occult blood testing is offered biennially to subjects aged 50-70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a positive faecal test are invited to undergo colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Familial history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in subjects undergoing colonoscopy was routinely recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1995 to 2009, 4833 screenees with positive faecal occult blood test undergoing colonoscopy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent reported a positive first degree family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis evidenced that the probability of detecting pathological significant lesions was statistically associated with age, gender, type of test, repeated or first screening, and having at least 1 first degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects attending colonoscopy reporting a positive first degree family history are at increased risk for pathologically significant lesions </plain></SENT>
