<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolation is a routine process in gene expression analysis studies, the applicability of most widely available formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples is still limited compared to fresh frozen tissue samples due to the lower quality of the isolated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, novel automated isolation methods were developed in order to reduce manual sample handling and increase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> quality and quantity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present a comparison of the performance of fresh frozen and matched FFPE tissue samples obtained from the same surgically removed colonic specimens (10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 10 CRC) in RT-PCR experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolations were performed with the automated MagNA Pure 96 Cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> Large Volume Kit (Roche) compared to the manual RNeasy FFPE Mini Kit (Qiagen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific marker set (with 7 genes: COL12A1, CXCL1, CXCL2, GREM1, IL1B, IL8, SLC7A5) was performed with array real-time PCR using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) and RealTime ready assays on LightCyclerÂ® 480 System (Roche) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the gene expression of the analyzed markers, fresh frozen tumorous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples could be distinguished with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity after both isolation methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FFPE samples could be distinguished by similarly high specificity and sensitivity with the MagNA Pure 96 isolated samples (sensitivity: 90,0%; specificity: 90,0%) and the samples isolated with manual Qiagen method (sensitivity: 85,0%; specificity: 70,0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to these results, FFPE samples isolated by automated methods can serve as valuable source for retrospective gene expression studies in the field of biomarker discovery and development </plain></SENT>
