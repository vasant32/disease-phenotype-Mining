<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab plus irinotecan in irinotecan-refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients from South-East Asia and Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this open-label, phase II study, the main eligibility criteria were epidermal growth factor receptor-positive mCRC with progressive disease within 3 mo of an irinotecan-based regimen as the most recent chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received cetuximab 400 mg/m2 initially, then 250 mg/m2 every week, with the same regimen of irinotecan on which the patients had progressed (4 pre-defined regimens allowed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives included a further investigation of PFS, and an assessment of the overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>), overall survival and the safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and twenty nine patients were enrolled from 25 centers in the Asia-Pacific region and of these 123 received cetuximab plus irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common recent irinotecan regimen used was 180 mg/m2 every 2 wk which had been used in 93 patients (75.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PFS rate at 12 wk was 50% (95% confidence interval (CI, 41-59) and median PFS time was 12.1 wk (95% CI: 9.7-17.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ORR was 13.8% (95% CI: 8.3-21.2) and disease control rate was 49.6% (95% CI: 40.5-58.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median duration of response was 31.1 wk (95% CI: 18.0-42.6) and median overall survival was 9.5 mo (95% CI, 7.5-11.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> was 11.7 wk (95% CI: 9.1-17.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (13.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (8.9%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (5.7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients from Asia and Australia, this study confirms the activity and safety of cetuximab plus irinotecan observed in previous studies in Europe and South America </plain></SENT>
