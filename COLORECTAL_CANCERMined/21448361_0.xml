<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the current status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) management, as well as the usage of cytoreductive surgery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in mainland China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A potentially curative therapeutic strategy for selecting patients with PC, known as "Techniques", consists of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> in combination with HIPEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systemic search of published works and clinical trials was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional papers were retrieved by cross-checking references and obtaining information from Chinese oncologists and relevant conferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and one papers and one registered clinical trial on HIPEC were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A literature review identified 86 hospitals in 25 out of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 31 areas of mainland China that perform HIPEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The earliest report included in our survey was published in 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different approaches to HIPEC have been utilized, i.e. palliative, prophylactic, and possibly curative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one center has consistently performed HIPEC according to the "Sugarbaker Protocol", which involves evaluating the extent of PC with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153467" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal cancer</z:e> index and the results of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> with the completeness of cytoreduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive preliminary results were reported: 7 of 21 patients with PC survived, free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, during an 8-43-mo follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hyperthermic strategies that include HIPEC have been practiced for a long time in mainland China, whereas the "Sugarbaker Protocol/Techniques" has been only rarely implemented in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Peritoneal Surface <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group International hosts a biannual workshop with the intent to train more specialists in this field and provide support for the construction of quality treatment centers, especially in developing countries like China, whose population is huge and has a dramatically increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To popularize Sugarbaker Protocol/Techniques in mainland China in PC management arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> will be the responsibility of the upcoming Chinese Peritoneal Surface <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group </plain></SENT>
