<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated previously that urine contains low-molecular-weight (LMW) (&lt;300 bp), circulation-derived DNA that can be used to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific mutations if a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to develop an assay to detect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>)-associated, circulation-derived, epigenetic DNA marker hypermethylated vimentin gene (mVIM) in the urine of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An artificial 18-nucleotide DNA sequence was tagged at the 5' end of the primers of the first PCR cycle to increase the amplicon size, which was then integrated into the primers of the second PCR cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A quantitative MethyLight PCR-based assay targeting a 39-nucleotide template was developed and used to quantify mVIM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and matched urine samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>mVIM was detected in 75% of LMW urine DNA samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n = 20) and in 10% of urine samples of control subjects with no known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (n = 20); 12 of 17 LMW urine DNA samples (71%) but only 2 of 17 high-molecular-weight urine DNA samples (12%) from patients with mVIM-positive tissues contained detectable mVIM, suggesting that the mVIM detected in LMW urine DNA is derived from the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detection of mVIM in urine was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with controls (P &lt; 0.0001, by Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A potential urine test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening using epigenetic markers is discussed </plain></SENT>
