<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Levels of the pro-tumorigenic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) are increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, previously attributed to increased synthesis through COX-2 upregulation and, more recently, to decreased catabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functionally linked genes 15-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> transporter PGT co-operate in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> degradation and are downregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported repression of 15-PGDH expression by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, commonly deregulated during early colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we asked whether β-catenin also regulates PGT expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of β-catenin deletion in vivo was addressed by PGT immunostaining of β-catenin(-/lox)-villin-cre-ERT2 mouse tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of siRNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown and dnTCF4 induction in vitro was addressed by semi-quantitative and quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study shows for the first time that deletion of β-catenin in murine intestinal epithelium in vivo upregulates PGT protein, especially in the crypt epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, β-catenin knockdown in vitro increases PGT expression in both colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>-derived cell lines, as does dnTCF4 induction in LS174T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that β-catenin employs a two-pronged approach to inhibiting <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> turnover during colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> by repressing PGT expression in addition to 15-PGDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data highlight a potential mechanism that may contribute to the non-selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> aspirin's chemopreventive efficacy </plain></SENT>
