<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> is often caused by disturbance in the regulation and/or execution of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (PCD, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and autophagy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate these two pathways simultaneously in the same samples to understand further the pathological roles of PCDs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) array was used to analyse the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and autophagy-related genes involved in pro- and anti-action of the pathways in 15 paired (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and non-cancerous part) colorectal samples using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the reference gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GAPDH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> content was significantly higher (approximately 4Â·01 fold) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue than that of paired non-cancerous part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absolute <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for most of the 22 genes were higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after normalization with GAPDH Ct, the expressions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the analysed genes were decreased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues, except for damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of most of the genes involved in the same pathway was closely correlated to each other in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and non-cancerous tissues, and the correlation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor (TNFR) and Akt to other genes in the same pathway was increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high level expression of GAPDH might reflect the metabolic state of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, and PCDs were down-regulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues when metabolic state was taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This relative suppression of PCDs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue is supposed to be in favour of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell survival </plain></SENT>
