<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-resistant cells display different behaviour to this drug versus the sensitive cells and if this difference may be further exploited into the clinical treatments improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to establish a stable cell line resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line (Colo320) was exposed to increasing doses of the drug up to the clinically relevant plasma concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four cell groups with different levels of chemoresistance were subjected to additional doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and their cytotoxicity, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and DNA damage production were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells selected for resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> reacted differently to the application of additional doses of the drug, displaying lower toxicity and cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and fewer DNA cross-links formation, in accordance with the extent of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> pretreatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the cross-links formation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> being the main cause for cytotoxicity of this drug and a correlation between cytotoxicity and clinical outcome being shown repeatedly, we consider that the evaluation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and DNA damage could be a valuable tool to assess the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells sensitivity and thus to predict the response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
