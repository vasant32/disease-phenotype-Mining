<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Research projects and clinical trials strongly rely on high-quality biospecimens which are provided by biobanks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since differences in sample processing and storage can strongly affect the outcome of such studies, standardization between biobanks is necessary to guarantee reliable results of large, multicenter studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Aid Foundation (Deutsche Krebshilfe e.V.) has therefore initiated the priority program "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue banks" in 2010 by funding four biobank networks focusing on central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinomas</z:hpo>, and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter one, the North German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Bank of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> (ColoNet) is managed by surgeons, pathologists, gastroenterologists, oncologists, scientists, and medical computer scientists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The ColoNet consortium has developed and harmonized standard operating procedures concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biobanking aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Crucial steps for quality assurance have been implemented and resulted in certification according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIN</z:e> EN ISO 9001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A further achievement is the construction of a web-based database for exploring available samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, common scientific projects have been initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, ColoNet's repository will be used for research projects in order to improve early diagnosis, therapy, follow-up, and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apart from the routine sample storage at -170 °C, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> banks' unique characteristic is the participation of outpatient clinics and private practices to further expand the sample and clinical data collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The first 2 years of funding by the German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Aid Foundation have already led to a closer scientific connection between the participating institutions and to a substantial collection of biospecimens obtained under highly standardized conditions </plain></SENT>
