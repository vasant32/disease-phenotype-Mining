<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A link between leptin or leptin receptor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development has been proposed and here, the hypothesis that leptin and its receptor might be implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) progression and invasion was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum leptin and leptin receptor levels were evaluated by commercial ELISA kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The multinomial logistic regression model showed a positive association of leptin and leptin receptor with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages, which was significant for the leptin receptor in stage IV of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High circulating levels of leptin receptor occur in patients with advanced stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, suggesting a role for leptin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
