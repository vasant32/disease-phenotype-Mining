<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> is accepted widely as the standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is no firm evidence base for this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This questionnaire survey was carried out to assess the current practice preferences of cardiothoracic surgeons in Great Britain and Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An online questionnaire survey was emailed to cardiothoracic surgeons in Great Britain and Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survey was live for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses were collated with SurveyMonkey(Â®) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, there were 75 respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority (83%) indicated thoracic surgery as a specialist interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (99%) used thoracic computed tomography (CT) for staging; 70% added liver CT and 51% added pelvic CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fluorodeoxy-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography was used by 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequent indication for pulmonary resection (97%) was solitary lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> without extrathoracic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was used by 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, thoracotomy was used by 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A third (33%) used radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Synchronous liver and lung resection was contraindicated for 83% of respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Over three-quarters (77%) thought that scientific equipoise exists presently for lung resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> but only 21% supported a moratorium on this type of surgery until further evidence becomes available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that the majority of respondents use conventional cross-sectional imaging and either VATS or formal thoracotomy for resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The results emphasise the continuing need for formal randomised trials to provide evidence of any survival benefit from pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
