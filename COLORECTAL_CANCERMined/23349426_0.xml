<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: /st&gt; Retrospective population-level study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic and treatment information were obtained from the Alberta <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Date of oncologist-consult was obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: /st&gt; Alberta, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: /st&gt; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients diagnosed in 2005 with breast, colon, rectal or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> who were residents of Alberta, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: /st&gt; (i) Number of days from diagnosis to first treatment by treatment modality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site, (ii) number of days from surgery to post-surgery consultation and subsequent treatment and (iii) relationship between clinical and demographic factors and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific provincial median time for outcome measures (i) and (ii) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: /st&gt; Time from diagnosis to surgery, if first treatment, was âˆ¼4 months for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> compared with 1-2 months for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with this time interval for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> was stage at diagnosis but was region of residence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
