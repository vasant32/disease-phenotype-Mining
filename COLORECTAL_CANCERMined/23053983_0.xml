<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates gene expression of interleukin (IL)-12-related cytokine and IL-10 in stimulated monocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative quantification of IL-12A, IL-12B, IL-23A and IL-10 mRNA transcripts was performed on the third hours after stimulation by real-time qPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also explored an inhibitor of JNK signaling pathway activation for the observed cytokine gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A strong downregulation of IL-12B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> monocytes compared to healthy donors was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of transcription of IL-12B in stimulated monocytes was associated with the stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-12A gene in stimulated monocytes from patients with advanced was lower than early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed stage dependent JNK inhibition mediated reduction in IL-12A expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hyporesponsiveness was strongly expressed in monocytes from advanced then early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of IL-10 mRNA was almost equally in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> monocytes from early stages and healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that altered gene expression profiles of IL-12A, IL-12B, IL-23A at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> monocytes was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and can be attributed to anticancer immune response </plain></SENT>
