<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of a novel screening method that is as economical and non-invasive as the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A study was undertaken using canine scent detection to determine whether odour material can become an effective tool in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Exhaled breath and watery stool samples were obtained from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and from healthy controls prior to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each test group consisted of one sample from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and four control samples from volunteers without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These five samples were randomly and separately placed into five boxes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Labrador retriever specially trained in scent detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and a handler cooperated in the tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dog first smelled a standard breath sample from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, then smelled each sample station and sat down in front of the station in which a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> scent was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 33 and 37 groups of breath and watery stool samples, respectively, were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and controls, the sensitivity of canine scent detection of breath samples compared with conventional diagnosis by colonoscopy was 0.91 and the specificity was 0.99 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of canine scent detection of stool samples was 0.97 and the specificity was 0.99 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of canine scent detection was high even for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Canine scent detection was not confounded by current smoking, benign colorectal disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> scent does indeed exist and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific <z:chebi fb="29" ids="37577">chemical compounds</z:chebi> may be circulating throughout the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These odour materials may become effective tools in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the future, studies designed to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific volatile organic compounds will be important for the development of new methods for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
