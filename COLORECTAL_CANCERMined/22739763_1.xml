<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clamping maneuvers during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery reduce blood loss, but trigger reperfusion injury (RI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RI increases <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> in the reperfused organ through up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-8 is an important cytokine in RI promoting accumulation of neutrophils, a major source of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volatile <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> were demonstrated to reduce RI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> might attenuate MMP-9 up-regulation and consequently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell invasion in RI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isolated human neutrophils (n = 6) were preconditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi>, followed by stimulation with interleukin-8, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, or chemokine CXC-ligand 1 (CXCL1) to differentiate intracellular pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 release and activity were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and zymography, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CXC-receptor-2 (CXCR2) expression and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 were assessed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The impact of MMP-9 on the invasion of neutrophils and MC-38 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells was assessed using Matrigel-coated filters (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preconditioning reduced interleukin-8-induced MMP-9-release by 41% (±13, 5%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi>) and 40% (±13%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was also evident following stimulation of CXCR2 with CXCL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No impact on phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and MMP-9 release was observed with receptor-independent stimulation of protein kinase C with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning reduced transmigration of neutrophils and MC-38 tumor cells to baseline levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Volatile <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> impair neutrophil MMP-9 release and interfere with pathways downstream of CXCR2, but upstream of protein kinase C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Through down-regulation of MMP-9, volatile <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> decrease Matrigel breakdown and reduce subsequent migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
