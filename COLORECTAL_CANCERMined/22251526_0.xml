<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is an evaluation of the feasibility of SLCR for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Fifty-one consecutive patients received SLCR from 2008 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure was performed with four trocars and one laparoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The short-term outcomes and complications were investigated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 67 years (range 42-81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median operating time for SLCR was 168 minutes (range 90-268) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For one patient (1.96%) conversion to open surgery was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic leakage developed in 1 (1.96%) patient and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> developed in 2 (3.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median postoperative hospital stay was 8 (range 6-60) days without in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, SLCR for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is feasible and compares favorably with the standard technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diminished need for human operative assistance provides significant economic and organizational benefits </plain></SENT>
