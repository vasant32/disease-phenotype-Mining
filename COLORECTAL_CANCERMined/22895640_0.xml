<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>) present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues, are responsible for resistance to conventional therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, effective recognition of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> is of great importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, to explore the potential characterizations of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> by the expression of specific cell surface markers such as CD133 and CD44, we screened six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines using western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SW620, one of the six cell lines analyzed, was sorted into four subpopulations by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The capability of colony formation, proliferation rate, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, drug resistance, as well as their migratory and invasion potential were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that the combination of CD44 and CD133 correlates with the features of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> in SW620 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD44 positive cells showed more robust colony formation, higher proliferation, less spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, a higher resistance to drug-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and were enriched after drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among CD44 positive SW620 cells, the CD133 negative subpopulation was more migratory and invasive, which means that CD44+CD133- correlates with most of features proposed for <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the data presented herein showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> have a wide range of expression for CD44 and CD133; it is unlikely the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> can be characterized by any single marker or the same set of markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For SW620 cells, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> are likely represented by the CD44+CD133- surface marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> markers represented by one positive and one negative is in line with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, such as CD34+CD38- for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>; CD44+CD24- for breast and <z:mp ids='MP_0009153'>pancreatic tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The absence of surface molecule(s) on <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> will make it even more difficult to track and target this group of minority cells </plain></SENT>
