<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Although exercise has been addressed as a promising therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> adverse effects, few studies have evaluated the beneficial effects of exercise for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of supervised-exercise intervention with those of usual care on cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e>, sleep quality, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> undergoing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Patients with stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> admitted for adjuvant chemotherapy were allocated to either a supervised-exercise group that received a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program or a "usual care" control group for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcomes, QoL, muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e>, physical activity, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and sleep quality, were assessed at baseline and after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Significant interactions between intervention and time were observed for the role functioning and pain subscales of QoL and physical activity level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time main effects were significant for the secondary outcomes: hand-grip strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity level, and physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and pain subscales of QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: Compared with usual care, the supervised exercise demonstrated larger effects than usual care on physical activity level and role functioning and pain subscales of QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:: Supervised-exercise program is suggested to be incorporated as part of supportive care to promote the cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, physical activity level, and QoL of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> undergoing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
