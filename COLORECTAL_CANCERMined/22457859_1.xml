<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also found <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risks based on population ethnicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are described in the literature as having site and/or stage specificity, including rs10795668, rs3802842, rs6983267, and rs4939827 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Replication of initial findings in different ethnic groups by independent studies is required to unravel the population-specific differences in risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined whether inherited risk variants at rs10795668, rs3802842, rs6983267, and rs4939827 exerted a differential effect on colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> in a Romanian hospital based series of 153 CRC cases and 182 non-affected control subjects prospectively recruited between 2007 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal tumors</z:e> were significantly associated with rs4939827 (OR = 4.85, P = 0.002) and rs6983267 (OR = 3.00, P = 0.036), suggesting that carriers of risk alleles at these loci had increased susceptibility to development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carrying the C allele at rs3802842 appeared to be associated with a lower risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e> in our dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no association between genotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> as reflected by TNM staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The associations between SNPs, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site and staging remain to be further clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results should be considered cautiously, but may be taken into account in future, larger epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
