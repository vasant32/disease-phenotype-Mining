<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Upper urinary tract urothelial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (UTUC) shares many similarities with bladder-UC, but there is strong evidence on a clinical, aetiological, epidemiological and genetic level that key differences exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this review, we aim to highlight how UTUC differs from bladder-UC and report on the utility of molecular markers in the diagnosis and management of UTUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using the Medline and Embase databases and specific keyword combinations: 'urothelial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>', '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e>', 'transitional cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>', 'upper tract', 'upper urinary tract', 'genetics', 'prognosis' and 'biomarkers' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: UTUC has specific acquired (e.g. Balkans <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8050">phenacetin</z:chebi> abuse) and genetic hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors compared with bladder-UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, the molecular biology of UC is broadly similar, irrespective of location in the urinary tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there are distinct genetic (microsatellite instability) and epigenetic (hypermethylation) differences between some UTUC and bladder-UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical-pathological variables (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000126'>hydronephrosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> architecture, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, stage and grade) have independent predictive power in UTUC, but tissue and urinary biomarkers can improve the clinical prediction of recurrence, invasion and survival in UTUC, though the evidence level is weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: UTUC shares many similarities with bladder-UC, but there is strong evidence that they should be considered as distinct urothelial entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prospective multi-institutional studies investigating molecular markers are urgently needed to augment clinic-pathological predictors in UTUC </plain></SENT>
