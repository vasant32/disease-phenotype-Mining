<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The information available on the TRAP1 pathway describes just a few well-characterized functions of this protein in mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, our group's use of mass-spectrometric analysis identified TBP7, an AAA-ATPase of the 19S proteasomal subunit, as a putative TRAP1-interacting protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, TRAP1 and TBP7 colocalize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as demonstrated by biochemical and confocal/electron microscopic analyses, and interact directly, as confirmed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of TRAP1's presence in this cellular compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TRAP1 silencing by short-hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, in cells exposed to thapsigargin-induced ER stress, correlates with upregulation of BiP/Grp78, thus suggesting a role of TRAP1 in the refolding of damaged proteins and in ER stress protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistently, TRAP1 and/or TBP7 interference enhanced stress-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and increased intracellular protein ubiquitination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These experiments led us to hypothesize an involvement of TRAP1 in protein quality control for mistargeted/misfolded mitochondria-destined proteins, through interaction with the regulatory proteasome protein TBP7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, expression of specific MITO proteins decreased upon TRAP1 interference as a consequence of increased ubiquitination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proposed TRAP1 network has an impact in vivo, as it is conserved in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, is controlled by ER-localized TRAP1 interacting with TBP7 and provides a novel model of the ER-mitochondria crosstalk </plain></SENT>
