<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with biallelic mutations in these genes, however, present earlier, with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> syndrome (CMMRD) which is characterised by a spectrum of rare childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and caf√©-au-lait skin patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hallmark of MMR deficiency, microsatellite instability (MSI), is readily detectable in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> DNA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, but is also present in constitutional DNA of CMMRD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, detection of constitutional or germline MSI (gMSI) has hitherto relied on technically difficult assays that are not routinely applicable for clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently we have developed a simple high throughput screening methodology to detect gMSI in CMMRD patients based on the presence of stutter peaks flanking a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat allele when amplified from patient blood DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the three different microsatellite markers, the gMSI ratio was determined in a cohort of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and 10 CMMRD patients, with biallelic germline mutations in PMS2 (7 patients), MSH2 (1 patient) or MSH6 (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with either PMS2 or MSH2 mutations were easily identified; however this measure was not altered in patients with CMMRD due to MSH6 mutation </plain></SENT>
