<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Material and method: Between January 2004 and January 2011, 214 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have been operated on in our ward; from those, eight patients had multiple colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: The majority of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> (six cases) was hospitalized under emergency status, with incomplete or complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> through colonic obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The favourite localizations were on the sigmoid (six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>) and the transverse colon (four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was preoperatively assessed in three cases by colonoscopy and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema, intraoperative in four cases, postoperative in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Curative operations were performed in five cases and palliative operations in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediate postsurgical evolution was good, long time evolution was marked by the complications of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of five patients that were long term monitored, three have a five year survival, one has survived for three years and one deceased within a nine month period after surgery, with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Preoperative diagnosis of synchronous lesions can be difficult (emergency hospitalized patient, incomplete bowel preparation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002584'>intestinal bleeding</z:hpo>) and the colonoscopy exam can be incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rigorous intraoperative colonic examination is necessary in order to diagnose synchronous lesions and avoid surgical reintervention </plain></SENT>
