<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of d,l-leucovorin (d,l-LV) dose on efficacy and toxicity of first-line bevacizumab+mFOLFIRI or mFOLFIRI treatment has never been investigated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was an investigator initiated retrospective observational investigation performed on 450 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mFOLFIRI regimen consisted of irinotecan (180 mg/m(2)), d,l-LV low (200 mg/m(2)) or high (400 mg/m(2)) dose and bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) (400 mg/m(2)), followed by a 46-h infusion of 5-FU (2400 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bevacizumab+mFOLFIRI regimen consisted of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg)+mFOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficacy (objective response [OR], progression-free [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) and toxicity was evaluated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of high versus low dose d,l-LV in bevacizumab+mFOLFIRI regimen improved the OR rate (63 and 38 %, respectively; P = 0.00015), median PFS (13 and 9 months, respectively; P = 0.000005) and median OS (26 and 21 months, respectively; P = 0.0058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of mFOLFIRI and the toxicity pattern of both bevacizumab+mFOLFIRI and mFOLFIRI regimens were independent of d,l-LV dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beside the d,l-LV dose the bevacizumab-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was an independent marker of longer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of high d,l-LV dose in bevacizumab+mFOLFIRI regimen would enhance the antiangiogenic effect of bevacizumab and subsequently the efficacy of treatment without increasing the number of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings need to be further confirmed in a randomized controlled prospective trial </plain></SENT>
