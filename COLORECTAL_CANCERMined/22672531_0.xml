<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the frequency of advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in consulting patients in Iceland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The histological configuration of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (CRA) found in 3603 patients was classified into tubular (TA), villous (VA) and serrated (SA) and the degree of neoplastic severity into low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ (CIS), intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) and submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (SMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Advanced CRA were those showing HGD, CIS, IMC and/or SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with two or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> with the highest degree of epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was selected to record cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2006 a total of 19424 endoscopic examinations (13572 colonoscopies and 5852 sigmoidoscopies) were performed in Iceland (mean, 4856 endoscopies per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At histology a mean of 759.3 CRA per year were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, CRA were found in 15.6% of the colorectal endoscopies performed per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of the 3037 CRA studied, 67% were TA, 29% VA and the remaining 4% SA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LGD was present in 79%, HGD in 15%, CIS in 2.4%, IMC in 1.9% and SMC in 1.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, out of 3037 CRA investigated, 652 (21.5%) were advanced CRA; 71% of these showed HGD, 11% CIS, 9% IMC and 9% SMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of the 652 advanced CRA were advanced VA, and more than three-quarters of 58 advanced CRA with SMC, were advanced VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Advanced VA displaying intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGD and CIS) showed a propensity to evolve into invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, VA displaying HGD and CIS might be regarded as biological markers for predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is the first study in which the frequency of CRA and advanced CRA detected in consulting patients is reported on a nationwide basis </plain></SENT>
