<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physiological saline or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> was injected twice during 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in rats, followed by the same saline or tPA at reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sizes of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and protein factors relating to neurorepair and neuroregeneration were examined at 4d after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein factors examined were: a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> neurocan, semaphorin type 3A (Sema3A), a myelin-associated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> receptor (Nogo receptor, Nogo-R), a synaptic regenerative factor (growth associated protein-43, GAP43), and a chemotropic factor netrin receptor (deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two groups treated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> only or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> plus tPA showed a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared to the two groups treated by vehicle only or vehicle plus tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses indicated that protein expression of neurocan, Sema3A, Nogo-R, GAP43, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> was decreased with tPA, but recovered with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> prevented the reductions of these five proteins induced by tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates for the first time that exogenous tPA reduced protein factors involved in inhibiting and promoting axonal growth, but that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> ameliorated such damage in brain repair after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
