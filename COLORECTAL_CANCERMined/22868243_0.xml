<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: This randomized, multicenter phase II study involved 80 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients aged 70 years and above [performance status (PS) 0-2] or 65 years and above (PS 2), randomly assigned to arm A (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1250 mg/m twice daily on days 1-14) or arm B (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1000 mg/m twice daily on days 1-14, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 100 mg/m on day 1 initially, 130 mg/m for subsequent cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint was response rate, and secondary endpoints were toxicity, progression-free survival, overall survival, and quality of life (QoL), which was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Confirmed response rates were 22.5% and 35.0% (P=0.217), progression-free survival were 4.4 and 6.6 months (P=0.335), and overall survival were 14.2 and 11.0 months (P=0.106) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicities were frequently observed in arm B, but grade â‰¥3 toxicities were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in arm A tended to present more favorable preservation of QoL in global health status, physical and role functioning, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and appetite loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Initial aggressive treatment strategy would not be recommended for this patient population because QoL appeared more preserved, treatments were better tolerated, and survivals did not differ in patients treated with initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
