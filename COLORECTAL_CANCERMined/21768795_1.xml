<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here the clinical benefit of bevacizumab plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in a 74-year-old female patient with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
