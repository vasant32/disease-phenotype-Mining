<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the outcomes of 42 patients underwent resection + RFA + HAI + systemic chemotherapy (RRHS) with that of 43 patients underwent resection + RFA + systemic chemotherapy (RRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall survival, the survival free of hepatic recurrence and the median survival in the RRHS group were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher than those in RRS group at 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the rates of adverse effects were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For patients with unresectable synchronous liver-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, RRHS not only decreases but also postpones hepatic recurrence and therefore improves overall survival at 4 years, as compared with RRS </plain></SENT>
