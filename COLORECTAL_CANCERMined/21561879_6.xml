<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of maternal and postweaning <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in the offspring was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female rats were placed on a control or supplemental (2.5Ã— the control) diet prior to mating and during pregnancy and lactation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At weaning, male pups from each maternal diet group were randomised to the control or supplemental diet (n=55 per each of the four maternal/pup diet groups) for 31 weeks and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was induced by azoxymethane at 5 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At necropsy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> parameters as well as colorectal epithelial proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and global DNA methylation were determined in the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Maternal, but not postweaning, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation significantly reduced the odds of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> by 64% in the offspring (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.71; p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pups from the dams fed the control diet that were given postweaning <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation had significantly higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> multiplicity and burden than other groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maternal and postweaning <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation interacted in a manner that decreased rectal epithelial proliferation (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both maternal and postweaning <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation significantly decreased DNA damage in the rectum (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maternal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation significantly increased (p=0.007), whereas postweaning supplementation significantly decreased (p&lt;0.001), colorectal global DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest for the first time that maternal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation at the level equivalent to the average postfortification total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake in North America and to that recommended to women at reproductive age protects against the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This protective effect may be mediated in part by increased global DNA methylation and decreased epithelial proliferation and DNA damage in the colorectum </plain></SENT>
