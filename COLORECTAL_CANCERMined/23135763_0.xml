<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop consortium statements on screening, surveillance and management of high-risk individuals with an inherited predisposition to PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 49-expert multidisciplinary international consortium met to discuss pancreatic screening and vote on statements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consensus was considered reached if ≥ 75% agreed or disagreed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was excellent agreement that, to be successful, a screening programme should detect and treat T1N0M0 margin-negative PC and high-grade dysplastic precursor lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and intraductal papillary mucinous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was agreed that the following were candidates for screening: first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with PC from a familial PC kindred with at least two affected FDRs; patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031269" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Peutz-Jeghers syndrome</z:e>; and p16, BRCA2 and hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC) mutation carriers with ≥ 1 affected FDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consensus was not reached for the age to initiate screening or stop surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was agreed that initial screening should include endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and/or MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography not CT or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no consensus on the need for EUS fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> to evaluate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was disagreement on optimal screening modalities and intervals for follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When surgery is recommended it should be performed at a high-volume centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was great disagreement as to which screening abnormalities were of sufficient concern to for surgery to be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening is recommended for high-risk individuals, but more evidence is needed, particularly for how to manage patients with detected lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Screening and subsequent management should take place at high-volume centres with multidisciplinary teams, preferably within research protocols </plain></SENT>
