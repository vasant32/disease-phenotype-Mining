<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Limited data suggest that second resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> may improve survival, but no study has compared surgery with chemotherapy in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we retrospectively compared the clinical outcome of potentially resectable patients who received a second metastasectomy with those who did not in our single-centre experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> in our centre over a period of 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected patients who relapsed after radical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and were deemed resectable again by our multidisciplinary team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then compared the clinical outcome of those who received a second operation with those who refused surgery and also evaluated the role of prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 60 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine underwent a second resection and 31 refused surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival rates were 58.7 and 24.0 months, median times to progression were 14.4 and 6.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who received surgery plus perioperatory chemotherapy (18/29) had a significantly better outcome; 4/29 achieved long-term disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that in highly selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, a multimodal treatment plan, including a second resection, can achieve longer survival with respect to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
