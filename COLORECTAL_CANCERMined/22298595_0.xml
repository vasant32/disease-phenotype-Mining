<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show how Ras activation causes aberrant nuclear localization of phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; MEK) MEK1/2 to drive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated MEK1/2 was aberrantly located within the nucleus of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, and oncogenic activation of Ras was sufficient to induce nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enforced nuclear localization of MEK1 in epithelial cells or fibroblasts was sufficient for hyperactivation of ERK1/2, thereby driving cell proliferation, chromosomal <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, Ras-induced nuclear accumulation of activated MEK1/2 was reliant on downregulation of the spatial regulator Sef, the reexpression of which was sufficient to restore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MEK1/2 localization and a reversal of Ras-induced proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings indicate that Ras-induced downregulation of Sef is an early oncogenic event that contributes to genetic instability and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> by sustaining nuclear ERK1/2 signaling </plain></SENT>
