<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The response rate was the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Safety, progression-free survival time, and median survival time were secondary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were untreated patients with inoperable advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan was administered at a dose of 100 mg/m² (on days 1 and 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S-1 (40 mg/m²) was administered for 2 weeks (on days 1 to 14) and followed by a 2-week rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients had grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and six patients had grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other serious hematologic or nonhematologic adverse reactions occurred, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received IRIS safely on an outpatient basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 52.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.1-68.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 8.6 months (95% CI, 5.3-11.9), and median survival time was 23.4 months (95% CI, 15.9-30.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IRIS produced a high response rate and could be given safely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IRIS may become a first-line treatment for inoperable or recurrent advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
