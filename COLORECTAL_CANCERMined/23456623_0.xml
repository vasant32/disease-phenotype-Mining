<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most primary human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are resistant to monotherapy with TRAIL apoptogens, and thus the potential applicability of TRAIL in anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> therapy ultimately depends on its rational combination with drugs targeting these resistances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our high-throughput screening for novel agents/drugs that could sensitize TRAIL-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells to TRAIL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we found homoharringtonine (HHT), a cephalotaxus <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloid</z:chebi> and tested anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> drug, to be a very effective, low nanomolar enhancer of TRAIL-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>/growth suppression of these resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Co-treatment of TRAIL-resistant RKO or HT-29 cells with HHT and TRAIL led to the effective induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the complete elimination of the treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HHT suppressed the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and cFLIP and enhanced the TRAIL-triggered activation of JNK and p38 kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The shRNA-mediated down-regulation of cFLIP or Mcl-1 in HT-29 or RKO cells variably enhanced their TRAIL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but it did not markedly sensitize them to TRAIL-mediated growth suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, with the notable exception of RKO/sh cFLIP cells, the downregulation of cFLIP or Mcl-1 significantly lowered the effective concentration of HHT in HHT + TRAIL co-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined HHT + TRAIL therapy also led to the strong suppression of HT-29 tumors implanted into immunodeficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, HHT represents a very efficient enhancer of TRAIL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with potential application in TRAIL-based, anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> combination therapy </plain></SENT>
