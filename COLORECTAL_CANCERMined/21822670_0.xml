<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The incidence and mortality of gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are among the highest <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate whether variations of the human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) gene are related to the risk of gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 622 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> patients, 383 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, and 932 healthy controls recruited to screen for variations in the 5'untranslated region (UTR) and to screen for the missense mutation (p.Ser326Cys) in exon7 of the hOGG1 gene using high-resolution melting curve analysis (HRM) and subsequent sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The promoter luciferase activity assay was applied to assess the potential influence of the detected variants on gene function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four variations, c.-53G&gt;C, c.-45G&gt;A, c.-23A&gt;G, and c.-18G&gt;T, were detected in the 5'-UTR of the hOGG1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The case-control study indicated that the c.-53G/C heterozygous genotype was markedly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (P = 0.008, OR = 2.304, 95% CI, 1.258-4.221), but not with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathological association analysis showed that the variant of c.-53G&gt;C in the hOGG1 gene was prevalent in low-differentiation patients (P = 0.012, OR = 3.174, 95% CI: 1.352-7.448) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This variant decreased the gene promoter activity by approximately 17.8% (P = 0.041) and exhibited a synergistic effect with the missense mutation p.Ser326Cys of hOGG1 by enhancing susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The variant c.-53G&gt;C in the 5'-UTR of the hOGG1 gene is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> and is potentially associated with low-differentiation degree, but not with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
