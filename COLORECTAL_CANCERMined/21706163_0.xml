<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study was performed to test the association between Glu298Asp polymorphisms in the NOS3 gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, NOS3 Glu298Asp polymorphism was genotyped in 84 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 99 healthy subjects using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the distribution of NOS3 genotypes and frequencies of the alleles between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and controls (P = 0.016, P = 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings have suggested that NOS3 Glu298Asp polymorphism might be associated with the risk and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Turkish population </plain></SENT>
