<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the pathological and molecular features of KRAS-mutated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and to compare them with other <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation testing was performed in 776 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status was assessed using both immunohistochemistry and MethyLight techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype and BRAF V600E mutation status were derived from earlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation in KRAS codon 12 or codon 13 was present in 28% of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, KRAS-mutated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were more frequently observed in contiguity with a residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> (38 vs 21%; P&lt;0.001), demonstrated mucinous differentiation (46 vs 31%; P=0.001) and were associated with different MSI status (P&lt;0.001) and with MGMT methylation (47 vs 21%; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> demonstrating neither BRAF nor KRAS mutation, KRAS-mutated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> showed more frequent location in the proximal colon (41 vs 27%; P=0.001), mucinous differentiation (46 vs 25%; P&lt;0.001), presence of a contiguous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> (38 vs 22%; P&lt;0.001), MGMT methylation (47 vs 26%; P=0.01) and loss of MGMT immunohistochemical expression (27 vs 19%; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS-mutated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were distributed in a bimodal pattern along the proximal-distal axis of the colorectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with male subjects, female subjects were more likely to have KRAS-mutated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the transverse colon and descending colon (39 vs 15%; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference in overall survival was observed in patients according to their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> KRAS mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, KRAS-mutated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> frequently develop in contiguity with a residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> and show molecular features distinct from other colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, in particular from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with neither BRAF nor KRAS mutation.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 25 January 2013; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2012.240 </plain></SENT>
