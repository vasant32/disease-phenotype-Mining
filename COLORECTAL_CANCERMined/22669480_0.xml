<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The regulation of chaperone activities involves their interaction with cochaperones; therefore we investigated the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 and their specific co-chaperones HOP and CHIP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Hsp90 by 17AAG increased the levels of Hsp70, Hsp90 and HOP but not CHIP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes are linked to activation of the HSF1 transcription factor and we show that the HOP promoter contains HSF1 binding sites, and that HSF1 binding to the HOP promoter is increased following 17AAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lack of alteration in the co-chaperone CHIP is explained by a lack of HSF response elements in the CHIP promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-proliferating cells expressed higher levels of CHIP and lower HOP, Hsp70 and Hsp90 levels compared to proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased expression of CHIP in proliferating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells is in keeping with its proposed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor properties, while over-expression of HOP in proliferating cells may contribute to excessive Hsp90 activity and stabilization of client proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples, increased expression of Hsp70 and an increased ratio of HOP to CHIP were found, and were associated with decreased median survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that multiple changes occur in the chaperone/co-chaperone system in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> that impact patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the ability to identify individual alterations to this system will be beneficial for treatment strategy decisions, particularly those that employ chaperone inhibitors </plain></SENT>
