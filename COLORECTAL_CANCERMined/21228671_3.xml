<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet recent developments in the use of chemotherapy and surgery have promised improvements in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the treatment and survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> managed over the last 20 years at a tertiary referral center and to define independent predictors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> treated from 1989 through 1995 served as a historical control for comparison with prospective cohorts treated from 1996 through 2002 or from 2003 through 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan Meier technique was used to calculate overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine independent predictors of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 313 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-year overall survival was significantly higher in the 2003 to 2009 cohort (40.3%; 95%CI, 28.6-51.8%) than in either the 1989 to 1995 cohort (20.6%, 95%CI, 13.5- 28.6%) or the 1996 to 2002 cohort (19.3%; 95%CI, 12.8-26.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant independent predictors for overall survival included surgical resection with anastomosis (hazard ratio, 0.507; 95%CI, 0.371-0.692), surgical resection with stoma (0.578; 0.401-0.833), <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score 3 (1.493; 1.150-1.941) or score 4 (2.532; 1.505-4.258), receiving palliative chemotherapy (0.64; 0.457-0.885), and receiving palliative radiotherapy (0.543; 0.352-0.835) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of overall survival for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> treated from 1989 through 2009, significant improvements were noted only in the last 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvements may be related to more widespread use of palliative chemotherapy, newer chemotherapy agents, surgical excision of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, and lower postoperative mortality </plain></SENT>
