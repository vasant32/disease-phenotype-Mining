<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Regorafenib is a novel multikinase inhibitor that has demonstrated broad antitumor activity across various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> types, in preclinical and clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preclinical data show inhibitory activity of angiogenic, stromal and oncogenic tyrosine kinases through the targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3, tyrosine-protein kinase receptor TIE-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î², fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret, mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit, RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and V600E mutant serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phase I trials have shown that the drug is relatively well tolerated at doses of 160 mg daily on a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule, or 100 mg daily on a continuous schedule, with adverse effects typical of other multikinase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase II studies demonstrated clinical benefit in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types, mostly associated with prolonged stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phase III studies include the CORRECT trial, which ultimately led to FDA approval of the drug in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> previously treated with standard therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is still much work to be done to determine the role of regorafenib in the future of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on the development of regorafenib, from early preclinical work through phase I, II and III trials, as well as highlighting the current role and potential future directions of this novel agent </plain></SENT>
