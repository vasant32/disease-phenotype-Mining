<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify the percentage of US hospitals that offered CTC between 2005 and 2008 and factors that motivated or impeded adoption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on the provision of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening services by nonfederal, general hospitals were analyzed using the 2005 to 2008 American Hospital Association annual surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in 2009, exploratory interviews were conducted with representatives from radiology departments at 9 hospitals; 6 that provided CTC and 3 that did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2008, 17% of hospitals offered CTC, up from 13% in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine percent of hospitals that offered CTC in 2008 also offered optical colonoscopy services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors motivating the adoption of CTC included a desire to provide an alternative screening option for frail, elderly patients and patients with failed optical colonoscopy; long waits for optical colonoscopy; and promising evidence on CTC published in peer-reviewed literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lack of reimbursement was a commonly cited barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Growth of CT colonographic services at US hospitals occurred even in the absence of Medicare coverage or agreement among national guideline-setting organizations regarding CTC's use in screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Almost one-third of hospitals that offer CTC do not offer optical colonoscopy and may not be prepared to provide adequate follow-up for patients with failed CTC </plain></SENT>
