<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown if 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E(2)) treatment is sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation and cell migration in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) is reported to associate with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell mobility, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we treated human LoVo <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with E(2) to explore whether E(2) down-regulates cell proliferation and migration, and to identify the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms behind the down-regulatory responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that E(2) treatment <z:mp ids='MP_0000352'>decreased cell proliferation</z:mp> and cell cycle-regulating factors such as cyclin A, cyclin D1 and cyclin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, E(2) significantly inhibited cell migration and migration-related factors such as uPA, tPA, MMP-2, and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, E(2) treatment showed no effects on upregulating expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, -2, -3, and -4 (TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After administration of inhibitors including QNZ (NFκB inhibitor), LY294002 (Akt activation inhibitor), U0126 (ERK1/2 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) or SP600125 (JNK1/2 inhibitor), E(2) -downregulated cell migration and expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in LoVo cells is markedly inhibited only by p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB203580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Application of specific target gene siRNA (ERα, ERβ, p38α, and p38β) to LoVo cells further confirmed that p38 MAPK mediates E(2) /ERs inhibition of MMP-2 and -9 expression and cell motility in LoVo cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results suggest that E(2) treatment down-regulates cell proliferation by modulating the expression of cyclin A, cyclin D1 and cyclin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>E(2) treatment simultaneously impaired cell migration by inhibiting the expression of uPA, tPA, MMP-2, and MMP-9 through E(2) /ERs - p38α MAPK signaling pathway in human LoVo <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
