<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, containing the isomeric 1(R),2(R)-DACH carrier ligand, enjoys worldwide clinic application as a most important therapeutic agent in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By extending the investigation to human chemotherapy-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, we have demonstrated the real effectiveness of 1 in circumventing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> resistance in LoVo <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The uptake of compound 1 by the latter cells was similar to that of sensitive LoVo cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the DNA adducts of 1 are removed from repair systems with lower efficiency and are more effective in inhibiting DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase </plain></SENT>
