<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the mechanism and fully characterizing the nature of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> offers the potential to identify those at greatest risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a case-control study comparing histologic disease activity (HDA; neutrophils on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin [H&amp;E]-stained slides) with immunohistochemistry (IHC) directed against specific cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We correlated IHC results with data previously generated on methylation status of RUNX3 and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-α) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nonadjacent, nonneoplastic section of bowel wall was identified for each UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HDA was assessed for UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases (n = 50) and UC-controls (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sections were immunostained using antibodies against macrophages (CD68), neutrophils/monocytes (myeloperoxidase, MPO), and T cells (CD3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Slides were scored using ImageJ and results reported as the percent area positive for each marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HDA did not correlate with infiltrate levels as measured by IHC and increasing HDA was inversely related to UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the percent area positive for CD68 and MPO was significantly elevated in UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases versus controls (P = 0.04 and &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In areas designated inactive, MPO staining remained significantly higher in UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases versus controls (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased MPO staining was associated with methylation of RUNX3 and the TNF-α -308G&gt;A SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HDA is less sensitive than IHC and may underestimate inflammatory cell populations associated with UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The epigenetic/genetic associations related to elevated MPO staining in UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may offer new methods for risk stratification and adjunctive screening tools </plain></SENT>
