<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to determine, for patients who had undergone recent colonoscopy, associations between specific colonoscopy patient characteristics, exam characteristics and patients' perception of colonoscopy reducing their risk of dying from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data (2004-2008) from the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry, consisting of a Self-report Questionnaire, Colonoscopy Report form, and a Follow-up Questionnaire, which measured agreement responses to the statement, "Having a colonoscopy decreased my chances of dying from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to assess differences in patient responses by patient and colonoscopy characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A majority of patients (N=5,672, 81%) agreed that having a colonoscopy decreased their chances of dying from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a personal history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were more likely to agree that colonoscopy reduced their chances of dying compared to patients without prior polypectomy [OR (95% CI) =1.34 (1.06, 1.69)] and patients with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were 33% more likely to agree to the statement than those without a family history [OR (95% CI) =1.33 (1.12, 1.58)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Personal history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are significant predictors of patients' positive perception of colonoscopy, suggesting that personal experience, rather than the potential preventive effect of colonoscopy itself, may influence the perceived benefit of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intervention efforts should be made to effectively disseminate knowledge of the preventive benefit of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
