<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between dietary intakes and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> who visited a health promotion center for a routine health check-up colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study using data from individuals who had colonoscopy at Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center from October 2003 to December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 242 patients (162 males and 80 females) with histopathologically confirmed colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, and 464 (272 males and 192 females) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary data were obtained via 24 hour dietary recall, assisted by a registered dietitian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The student's t-test and the chi-square test were performed for the statistical comparison of means and proportions among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed to assess the relation between dietary intake and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total average energy intake of the patients (male: 2,407.5±429.2 kcal, female: 1,901.3±316.9 kcal) was higher than the controls (male: 2,249.6±430.4 kcal, female: 1,752.4±275.0 kcal; p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High energy intake (male: OR=4.13, 95% CI=1.70-10.05, p=0.002; female: OR=4.00, 95% CI=1.51-10.61, p=0.005) and animal protein intake (male: OR=3.97, 95% CI=1.66-9.49, p=0.002; female: OR=5.76, 95% CI=1.99-16.169, p=0.001) were found to be associated with the risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> after adjusting for confounders such as age, BMI, waist circumference, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In summary, high energy intake and animal protein were associated with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
