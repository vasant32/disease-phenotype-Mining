<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increasing use of gastrointestinal endoscopy, particularly for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, and increasing emphasis on health care quality highlight the need for endoscopy facilities to review the quality of the service they offer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To adapt the United Kingdom Global Rating Scale (UK-GRS) to develop a web-based and patient-centred tool to assess and improve the quality of endoscopy services provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on feedback from 22 sites across Canada that completed the UK endoscopy GRS, and integrating results of the Canadian consensus on safety and quality indicators in endoscopy and other Canadian consensus reports, a working group of endoscopists experienced with the GRS developed the GRS-Canada (GRS-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The GRS-C mirrors the two dimensions (clinical quality and quality of the patient experience) and 12 patient-centred items of the UK-GRS, but was modified to apply to Canadian health care infrastructure, language and current practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each item is assessed by a yes‚ÅÑno response to eight to 12 statements that are divided into levels graded D (basic) through A (advanced) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A core team consisting of a booking clerk, charge nurse and the physician responsible for the unit is recommended to complete the GRS-C twice yearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The GRS-C is intended to improve endoscopic services in Canada by providing endoscopy units with a straightforward process to review the quality of the service they provide </plain></SENT>
