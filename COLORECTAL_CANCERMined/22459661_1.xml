<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the learning curve for accurate interpretation of confocal images acquired with eCLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the learning curve of eCLE, its diagnostic accuracy, and the intra- and interobserver agreement for the differentiation of colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Post hoc assessment of selected eCLE images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved colonoscopic images from 47 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Learning curve of eCLE, accuracy, and intraobserver and interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three endoscopists received a short introduction to eCLE before evaluating 90 images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Observers assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eCLE images by using the Mainz classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After each set of 30 images, the accuracy of each observer was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The same procedure was repeated 6 months later by using the same set of images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Post hoc assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant changes between the first set of 30 images and the 2 consecutive sets (P = .08 and P = .180, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy was 85.6%, 95.6%, and 92.2% for each observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The κ values of the intraobserver agreement were 0.68, 0.84, and 0.77 for each observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The κ value for interobserver agreement was 0.73 during the first and 0.72 during the second assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accurate post hoc interpretation of eCLE confocal images can be learned quickly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>High diagnostic accuracy was achieved by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 observers during the initial stage of the assessment, which remained high thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Intra- and interobserver agreement was substantial for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on the real-time assessment of eCLE images </plain></SENT>
