<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Increased levels of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> may protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) development and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating epidemiologic evidence suggests these effects may be partly mediated by genetic variants of the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR) proposed to be associated with altered risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wished to determine if common VDR polymorphisms affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the Czech Republic, a homogenous European population with a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Frequencies of the common VDR gene polymorphisms rs2238136, rs1544410 (BsmI), rs7975232 (ApaI), and rs731236 (TaqI) were determined using allele-specific PCR in a case control analysis of a series of 754 CRC patients and 627 patients without malignant disease recruited from centers throughout the Czech Republic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between these variants and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the four polymorphisms tested had any significant effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in susceptibility when the population was stratified by anatomical sub-site, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol, or presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that common variation in the VDR gene had little effect on its own on predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Czech population </plain></SENT>
