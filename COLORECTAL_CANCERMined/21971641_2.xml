<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (mCRC) carrying activating mutations of the KRAS gene do not benefit from treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, KRAS mutation testing of mCRC patients is mandatory in the clinical setting for the choice of the most appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Co-amplification-at-lower denaturation-temperature PCR (COLD-PCR) is a novel modification of the conventional PCR method that selectively amplifies minority alleles from a mixture of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant sequences irrespective of the mutation type or position within the sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the sensitivity of a COLD-PCR method with conventional PCR/sequencing and the real-time PCR-based Therascreen kit to detect KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using dilutions of KRAS mutant DNA in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> DNA from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines with known KRAS status, we found that Fast COLD-PCR is more sensitive than the conventional PCR method, showing a sensitivity of 2.5% in detecting G&gt;A and G&gt;T mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detection of G&gt;C transversions was not improved by either Fast COLD-PCR or Full COLD-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We next analyzed by COLD-PCR, conventional PCR and Therascreen 52 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 36 samples with &gt;30% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, 8 samples were negative by conventional PCR, Therascreen and Fast COLD-PCR; 20 mutations identified by conventional PCR were confirmed by Therascreen and Fast COLD-PCR; 8 cases undetermined by conventional PCR were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> confirmed to carry KRAS G&gt;A or G&gt;T mutations by using either Therascreen or Fast COLD-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conventional PCR was able to detect only 2 KRAS mutations among 16 samples with &lt;30% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (12.5%), whereas Therascreen and Fast COLD-PCR identified 6 mutants (37.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that Fast COLD-PCR has a higher clinical sensitivity as compared with conventional PCR in detecting G&gt;C to A&gt;T changes in the KRAS gene, which represent &gt;90% of the mutations of this oncogene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
