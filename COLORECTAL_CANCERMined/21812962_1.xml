<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated the predictive significance on survival of baseline quality of life (QoL) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) with little information on the impact of changes in QoL scores on prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether changes in QoL during treatment could predict survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 396 stages III-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients available for a minimum follow-up of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QoL was evaluated at baseline and after 3 months of treatment using EORTC QLQ-C30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression evaluated the prognostic significance of baseline, 3-month and changes in QoL scores after adjusting for age, gender and stage at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, every 10-point increase in both baseline appetite loss and global QoL score was associated with a 7% increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with HR = 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.14; P = 0.02) and (HR = 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87-0.98; P = 0.01) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was associated with a 10-point improvement in physical function at 3 months (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.94; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was associated with a 10-point improvement in social function at 3 months (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13; P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence to indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients whose physical function improves within 3 months of treatment have a significantly increased probability of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings should be used in clinical practice to systematically address QoL-related problems of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients throughout their treatment course </plain></SENT>
