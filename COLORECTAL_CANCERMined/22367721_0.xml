<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Few prospective studies have examined the associations between blood levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, in conjunction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the associations between plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, MTHFR C677T, and A1298C, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in three large prospective studies: the Nurses' Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and the Physicians' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 602 incident cases were identified and individually matched to controls who provided blood specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used conditional logistic regression to calculate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and then pooled the estimates using a random effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among participants with low plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels: compared with the lowest quartile, RRs (95% CIs) for each successively higher quartile of plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels were 1.55 (1.14-2.11), 1.37 (1.00-1.88), and 1.47 (1.07-2.01; P for trend = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the MTHFR polymorphisms, RRs (95% CIs) were 0.62 (0.44-0.90) for 677TT versus CC/CT and 0.68 (0.31-1.51) for 1298CC versus AC/AA, and these lower-risk genotypes were associated with lower circulating plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we partitioned the variation in plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels, variation due to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake was not positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that low plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels were associated with lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reasons underlying a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with low plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels require elucidation because plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels can reflect dietary intake, genetic influences, and other factors </plain></SENT>
