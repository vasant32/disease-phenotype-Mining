<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandated elimination of copayments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, including colonoscopy, but little is known about the effects of copayment elimination on use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The University of Texas employee, retiree, and dependent health plan instituted and promoted a waiver of copayments for screening colonoscopies in fiscal year (FY) 2009; we examined the effects of removing cost sharing on colonoscopy use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 59,855 beneficiaries of the University of Texas employee, retiree, and dependent health plan, associated with 16 University of Texas health and nonhealth campuses, ages 50-64 years at any point in FYs 2002-2009 (267,191 person-years of follow-up evaluation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was colonoscopy incidence among individuals with no prior colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the age- and sex-standardized incidence ratios for colonoscopy in FY 2009 (after the copayment waiver) with the expected incidence for FY 2009, based on secular trends from years before the waiver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual incidence of colonoscopy increased to 9.5% after the copayment was waived, compared with an expected incidence of 8.0% (standardized incidence ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.23; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, and beneficiary status, the copayment waiver remained significantly associated with greater use of colonoscopy, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Waiving copayments for colonoscopy screening results in a statistically significant, but modest (1.5%), increase in use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional strategies beyond removing financial disincentives are needed to increase use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
