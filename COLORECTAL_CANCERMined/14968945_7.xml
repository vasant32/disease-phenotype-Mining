<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 318 consecutive patients who had undergone curative resection of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the prognostic value of VEGF concentrations in plasma and serum obtained 6 months postoperatively was analysed and the results compared with the prognostic value of postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations in matched serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, high serum and plasma VEGF ( &gt; 533 pg/ml and &gt; 112 pg/ml, respectively) had no significant (p = 0.17 and p = 0.13, respectively) impact on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, high serum CEA ( &gt; 5 ng/ ml) was significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) correlated to a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, in multivariate analyses, the combination of high serum CEA and high serum VEGF was significantly (hazard ratio 3.0, p = 0.02) associated with poor survival compared to high serum CEA and low serum VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that 6 months postoperatively serum CEA is a better prognostic marker than corresponding serum and plasma VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, high serum VEGF within high serum CEA was an even better predictor of overall survival than high serum CEA alone </plain></SENT>
