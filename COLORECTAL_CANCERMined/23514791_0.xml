<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> are fatal if untreated and resection can possibly be curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Predictive models stratify patients into riskÂ categories to predict prognosis and select those who can benefit from aggressive multidisciplinary treatment and intensive follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard linear models assume proportional hazards, whereas more flexible non-linear survival models based on ANNs may better predict individual long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinicopathological and perioperative data on patients who underwent liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> between 1994 and 2009 were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A five-fold cross-validated ANN model was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk variables were ranked and minimised through calibrated ANNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time dependent hazard ratio (HR) was calculated using the ANN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Performance of the ANN model and Cox regression were analysed using Harrell's C-index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 241 patients with a median age of 66 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and median survival was 56 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 28 potential risk variables, the ANN selected six: age, preoperative chemotherapy, size of largest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, haemorrhagic complications, preoperative CEA-level and number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The C-index was 0.72 for the ANN model and 0.66 for Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For the first time ANNs were used to successfully predict individual long-term survival for patients following liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the future, more complex prognostic factors can be incorporated into the ANN model to increase its predictive ability </plain></SENT>
