<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a phase I/II first-in-man trial with L19-TNF monotherapy in metastatic solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients to study safety and signs of clinical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six cohorts of patients were treated with increasing (1.3-13 μg/kg) doses of intravenous L19-TNF on day 1, 3, and 5 of repeated 3-weekly cycles, and 12 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were treated at 13 μg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PK, antibody formation, changes in lymphocyte subsets, 5-HIAA plasma levels as well as safety and clinical activity were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four patients received at least one L19-TNF dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum half-life of L19-TNF at 13 μg/kg was 33.6 min, and maximum peak serum concentration was 73.14 μg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mild chills, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> but no haemato- or unexpected toxicity were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 lumbar pain in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastasis</z:e> was the only dose-limiting toxicity found in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> responses were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transient stable disease occurred in 19 of 31 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous L19-TNF on day 1, 3, and 5 of a 3-weekly schedule was safe up to 13 μg/kg, but did not result in objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached, allowing for further dose escalation of L19-TNF possibly in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
