<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of the Wnt signalling pathway has been linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The orphan nuclear receptor TR3 plays important roles in proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated how TR3 suppresses intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> by regulating Wnt signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005266'>Intestinal polyps</z:hpo> were quantified in Apc(min/+), Apc(min/+)/TR3(-/-) and Apc(min/+)/villin-TR3 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wnt signalling activity was evaluated by assessing β-galactosidase activity in a BAT-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> reporter strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TR3 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> cytosporone B was used to evaluate the role of TR3 in intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Crosstalk between TR3 and β-catenin/TCF4 was analysed by molecular methods in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of TR3 by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase (GSK) 3β and the correlation between GSK3β activity and TR3 phosphorylation were evaluated in clinical samples and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TR3 was found to significantly suppress Wnt signalling activity and the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Apc(min/+)/TR3(-/-) mice developed more <z:hpo ids='HP_0005266'>intestinal polyps</z:hpo> than Apc(min/+)/TR3(+/+) mice, whereas either transgenic overexpression of TR3 in the intestine or treatment with cytosporone B in Apc(min/+) mice significantly decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumour</z:e> number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, TR3 disrupted the association of β-catenin and TCF4 on chromatin and facilitated the recruitment of transcriptional co-repressors to the promoters of Wnt signalling target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, TR3 was phosphorylated by GSK3β in most clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, which attenuated the inhibitory activity of TR3 towards Wnt signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TR3 is a negative regulator of Wnt signalling and thus significantly suppresses intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in Apc(min/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect of TR3 may be paradoxically overcome through phosphorylation by GSK3β in clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
