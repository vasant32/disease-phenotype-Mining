<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the accuracy of the latest generation of endoscopes with older generation models in detection of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared data from 2 prospective screening colonoscopy studies (the Berlin Colonoscopy Project 6); each study lasted approximately 6 months and included the same 6 colonoscopists, who worked in private practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants in group 1 (n = 1256) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined by using the latest generation of wide-angle, high-definition colonoscopes that were manufactured by the same company </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals in group 2 (n = 1400) were examined by endoscopists who used routine equipment (a mixture of endoscopes from different companies; none of those used to examine group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate was calculated on the basis of the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>/number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in patient parameters or withdrawal time between groups (8.0 vs 8.2 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate was significantly higher in group 1 (0.33) than in group 2 (0.27; P = .01); a greater number of patients with least 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> were identified in group 1 (22.1%) than in group 2 (18.2%; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A higher percentage of high-grade dysplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in group 1 (1.19%) than in group 2 (0.57%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The latest generation of wide-angle, high-definition colonoscopes improves rates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection by 22%, compared with mixed, older technology endoscopes used in routine private practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings might affect definitions of quality control parameters for colonoscopy screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
