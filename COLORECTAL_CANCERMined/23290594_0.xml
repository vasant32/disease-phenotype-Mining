<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that racial differences that exist in the distribution of ABO blood type would partially explain the racial disparity in overall survival seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: retrospective analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry of a university hospital for patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1996 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific, and treatment-specific variables were abstracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also obtained ABO blood group data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We divided patients into two groups based on where they underwent surgery: the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) or outside facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 833 patients, 182 (21.8%) were black </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in overall survival between blacks and whites for the entire group (P = 0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in overall survival between patients at the UAMS and outside facilities (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the outside facilities group, there was a statistically significant difference in overall survival between blacks and whites (hazard ratio, CI: 1.48 [1.06-2.00]; PÂ = 0.012); no race difference existed for the UAMS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ABO blood group had no effect on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On stage-stratified univariate and multivariate analyses, chemotherapy and surgery were the only statistically significant determinants of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, racial differences in ABO blood group distribution had no effect on overall survival </plain></SENT>
