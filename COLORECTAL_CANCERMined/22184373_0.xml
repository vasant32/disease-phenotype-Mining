<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Since the early 1980s, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) mortality rates for whites and blacks in the United States have been diverging as a result of earlier and larger reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates for whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether this mortality pattern varies by stage at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Incidence-Based Mortality database of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program was used to examine data from the nine original SEER regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our main outcome measures were changes in stage-specific mortality rates by race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1985 to 1987 to 2006 to 2008, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality rates decreased for each stage in both blacks and whites, but for every stage, the decreases were smaller for blacks, particularly for distant-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For localized stage, mortality rates decreased 30.3% in whites compared with 13.2% in blacks; for regional stage, declines were 48.5% in whites compared with 34.0% in blacks; and for distant stage, declines were 32.6% in whites compared with 4.6% in blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, the black-white rate ratios increased from 1.17 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.39) to 1.41 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.63) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>, from 1.03 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.14) to 1.30 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.44) for regional disease, and from 1.21 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.34) to 1.72 (95% CI, 1.58 to 1.86) for distant-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In absolute terms, the disparity in distant-stage mortality rates accounted for approximately 60% of the overall black-white mortality disparity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The black-white disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality increased for each stage of the disease, but the overall disparity in overall mortality was largely driven by trends for late-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concerted efforts to prevent or detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at earlier stages in blacks could improve the worsening black- white disparities </plain></SENT>
