<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Hippo pathway restricts the activity of transcriptional coactivators TAZ (WWTR1) and YAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TAZ and YAP are reported to be overexpressed in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, however, their prognostic significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> remains unstudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of TAZ and YAP, and their downstream transcriptional targets, AXL and CTGF, were extracted from two independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patient datasets available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, totaling 522 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of both TAZ and YAP were positively correlated with those of AXL and CTGF (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High level <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TAZ, AXL or CTGF significantly correlated with shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, patients co-overexpressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 genes had a significantly shorter survival time, and combinatorial expression of these 3 genes was an independent predictor for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The downstream target genes for TAZ-AXL-CTGF overexpression were identified by Java application MyStats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, genes that are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> progression (ANTXR1, EFEMP2, SULF1, TAGLN, VCAN, ZEB1 and ZEB2) were upregulated in patients co-overexpressing TAZ-AXL-CTGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This TAZ-AXL-CTGF gene expression signature (GES) was then applied to Connectivity Map to identify small molecules that could potentially be utilized to reverse this GES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the top 20 small molecules identified by connectivity map, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2639">amiloride</z:chebi> (a <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> sparing <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi>), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15367">tretinoin</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>) have shown therapeutic promise in inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using MyStats, we found that low level expression of either ANO1 or SQLE were associated with a better prognosis in patients who co-overexpressed TAZ-AXL-CTGF, and that ANO1 was an independent predictor of survival together with TAZ-AXL-CTGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, we confirmed that TAZ regulates Axl, and plays an important role in clonogenicity and non-adherent growth in vitro and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that TAZ could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
