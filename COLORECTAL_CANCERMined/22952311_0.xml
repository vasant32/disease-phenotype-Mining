<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Health behaviors are known risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and are more common in low socioeconomic status (SES) populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the extent to which behavioral risk factors and body mass index (BMI) explain SES disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence, overall and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed prospective National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study data on 506 488 participants who were recruited in 1995-1996 from six US states and two metropolitan areas and followed through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed baseline data on risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, including health behaviors, were obtained using questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SES was measured by self-reported education and census-tract data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome was primary incident invasive colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poisson regression was used to estimate the association between SES and risk of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with adjustment for age, sex, race and ethnicity, family history, and state of residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model estimates were used to derive percentage mediation by behavioral risk factors; bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals were obtained through bootstrap techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven-thousand six-hundred seventy-six participants developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SES differences in prevalence of physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, and unhealthy weight each explained between 11.3% (BMI) and 21.6% (diet) of the association between education and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and between 8.6% (smoking) and 15.3% (diet) of the association between neighborhood SES and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Health behaviors and BMI combined explained approximately 43.9% (95% CI = 35.1% to 57.9%) of the association of education and 36.2% (95% CI = 28.0% to 51.2%) of the association of neighborhood SES with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The percentage explained by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> factors and BMI combined was largest for right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> and smallest for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of the socioeconomic disparity in risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and particularly of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>, may be attributable to the higher prevalence of adverse health behaviors in low-SES populations </plain></SENT>
