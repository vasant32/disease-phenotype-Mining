<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>Skin rash</z:hpo> is a predictable and manageable side effect of anti-EGFR therapy such as cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to estimate the costs for the foreseeable management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> in patients treated with cetuximab in our institute in order to assess the direct medical economic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with cetuximab at our institute from June 2006 to May 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the severity and mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> for each grade and we identified the costs for the different therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated according to the general consensus management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> associated with cetuximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We evaluated 31 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 28.95 months (range, 1.84-75.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up 10 patients (32.3%) were alive with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, 18 patients (58.1%) had died, 1 patient (3.2%) was alive without evidence of disease, and 2 patients (6.5%) were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 8.26 months and the median overall survival 32.89 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (61.3%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicities</z:e>: 7 patients (22.6%) grade 1, 9 patients (29.0%) grade 2, 3 patients (9.7%) grade 3; no grade 4 skin toxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median duration of grade 1 toxicity was 79 days (no specific treatments were started), of grade 2 toxicity 95 days (cost range, € 199.50-294.50) and of grade 3 toxicity 64 days (cost range, € 159.42-233.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our experience, through the analysis of nonselected cases, showed that the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicities</z:e> related to cetuximab is not so expensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We recommend proper care of low-grade toxicities in order to reduce progression to high-grade toxicities and the resulting risk of hospitalization, which really impacts on costs </plain></SENT>
