<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the intestinal mucosa is characterized by a marked enrichment of immune cells such as macrophages as well as by high expression of cytokines and growth factors including transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule L1CAM mediates chemoresistance and migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and is elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues being associated with metastatic spread and poor prognosis for the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examine the role of TGF-β1-induced L1CAM expression and macrophages in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of intestinal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that TGF-β1 stimulation leads to a Slug-dependent upregulation of L1CAM expression already in the colonic intestinal epithelial cell line NCM460 thereby enhancing cell motility and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, NCM460 cells acquired a migratory and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistant phenotype if transfected with L1CAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of colonic biopsies revealed considerable L1CAM expression in intestinal epithelial cells in tissues from IBD patients but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, L1CAM expression increased with duration of disease being associated with the presence of CD33+ macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coculture with macrophages generated from monocyte colony-stimulating factor (MCSF)-treated monocytes led to the upregulation of Slug and L1CAM in NCM460 cells thereby elevating cell motility and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β1 signalling abolished expression of Slug and L1CAM in cocultured NCM460 cells resulting in decreased cell migration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data provide new insights into the mechanisms by which IBD promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of intestinal epithelial cells and underscore the role of L1CAM and macrophages in this scenario </plain></SENT>
