<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The difference in mortality between emergency and elective surgery for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235328" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic obstruction</z:e> is more than 5% in healthy patients below the age of 65 and increases with age to around 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery can be avoided by endoscopic placement of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SEMS as 'bridge to surgery' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between January 2001 and July 2008, SEMS were placed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235328" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic obstruction</z:e> in 45 patients (median age 72 years, range 35-91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure was technically successful in 43 patients (94%) with resolution of obstructive symptoms within 48 h in 87% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> occurred during the procedure or while awaiting surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two (4%) patients required a second endoscopic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a single-stage surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality was 2.2% (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histology showed advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (T3-4N1-2M0-1) in 75% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SEMS placement is a safe and effective procedure as bridge to surgery in patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235328" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic obstruction</z:e> due to colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This procedure carries a risk of serious complications well below that of the reported difference in mortality between emergency an elective surgery </plain></SENT>
