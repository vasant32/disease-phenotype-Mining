<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the EQ-5D health questionnaire for use in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were recruited from one ambulatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each participant consecutively self-administered the EQ-5D, the EORTC QLQ-C30, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Discriminatory ability was evaluated by comparing the SF-36 subscales with their corresponding EQ-5D dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Convergent validity was assessed by examining the correlations between the EQ-5D index, EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales, and SF-36 scale and summary scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Test-retest reliability was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects reporting problems in each EQ-5D dimension showed lower scores on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SF-36 subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, the relationships were stronger between the EQ-5D functional dimensions and physical function on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and between the EQ-5D <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> dimension and emotional function on the EORTC QLQ-C30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EQ-5D index and SF-36 scales were moderately or highly correlated. intraclass correlation coefficient of the EQ-5D index was 0.45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Korean version of the EQ-5D may be a valid tool for assessing the health-related quality of life of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, further research is needed to determine the reliability of the Korean EQ-5D over different time intervals and disease conditions </plain></SENT>
