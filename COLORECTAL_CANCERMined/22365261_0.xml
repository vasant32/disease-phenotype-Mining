<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A survey was conducted among a random sample (n = 1844) nested in a screening cohort of a rural population in Jiashan County, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information about diet, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and other factors was collected by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was dietary status, assessed by consumption (servings/week) of plant-based food and unhealthy food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear or multinomial logistic regressions were used to determine risk factors for dietary status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On average, individuals with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> ate 2.25 fewer servings of plant-based food each week compared with individuals without a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals who smoked and drank alcohol ate less plant-based food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After stratification by gender, there were multiple determinants for consumption of plant-based food for men, including family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, smoking, alcohol consumption and income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For women, the only association was found for income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consumption of unhealthy food was positively associated with high income and high body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Determinants for an unhealthy diet were the same in both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are gender disparities in the consumption of plant-based food and the risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in medically and economically underserved populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Men's insufficient consumption of plant-based food and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, such as smoking and drinking, may explain, in part, why men have a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than women </plain></SENT>
