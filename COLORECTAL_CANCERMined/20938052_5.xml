<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Alternative splicing is a crucial step in the generation of protein diversity and its misregulation is observed in many human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By analyzing 143 colorectal samples using exon arrays, SLC39A14, a divalent cation transporter, was identified as being aberrantly spliced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SLC39A14 contains two mutually exclusive exons 4A and 4B and the exon 4A/4B ratio was significantly altered in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (p = 3.6 × 10(-10)) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (p = 9.4 × 10(-11)), independent of microsatellite stability status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were validated in independent exon array data sets and by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aberrant Wnt signaling is a hallmark of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and is characterized by nuclear β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experimental inactivation of Wnt signaling in DLD1 and Ls174T cells by knockdown of β-catenin or overexpression of dominant negative TCFs (TCF1 and TCF4) altered the 4A/4B ratio, indicating that SLC39A14 splicing is regulated by the Wnt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An altered 4A/4B ratio was also observed in gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> where Wnt signaling is also known to be aberrantly activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The splicing factor SRSF1 and its regulator, the kinase SRPK1, were found to be deregulated upon Wnt inactivation in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SRPK1 was also found up-regulated in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> samples (p = 1.5 × 10(-5)) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples (p = 5 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In silico splicing factor binding analysis predicted SRSF1 to bind predominantly to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> associated exon 4B, hence, it was hypothesized that SRPK1 activates SRSF1 through phosphorylation, followed by SRSF1 binding to exon 4B and regulation of SLC39A14 splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indeed, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SRPK1 and SRSF1 in DLD1 and SW480 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells led to a change in the 4A/4B isoform ratio, supporting a role of these factors in the regulation of SLC39A14 splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, alternative splicing of SLC39A14 was identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> and found to be regulated by the Wnt pathway, most likely through regulation of SRPK1 and SRSF1 </plain></SENT>
