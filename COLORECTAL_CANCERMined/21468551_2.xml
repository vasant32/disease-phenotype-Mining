<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA copy number aberrations (DCNAs) were identified in association with clinicopathological features: a gain of 8q24.3 and losses of 9q33.1 and 20p12.2 were associated with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, gain of 8q24.3 and loss of 9q33.1 with disease stage, gain of 8q21.11 and loss of 10q21.3 with lymphovascular invasion and losses of 3p25.1, 10p15.3, 12q15 and 17p13.1 for venous invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These aberrations can be regarded as genomic biomarkers to predict the clinical outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and are expected to serve to individualize the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
