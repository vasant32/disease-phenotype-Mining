<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The JNK family of MAPKs is involved in a large variety of physiological and pathological processes in brain development, such as neural survival, migration, and polarity as well as axon regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether JNK activation is involved in axon guidance remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence indicating the JNK pathway is required for Netrin signaling in the developing <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1 increased JNK1, not JNK2 or JNK3, activity in the presence of deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (DSCAM), and expression of both of them further enhanced Netrin-1-induced JNK1 activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of JNK signaling either by a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, or expression of a dominant negative form of MKK4, a JNK upstream activator, blocked Netrin-1-induced JNK1 activation in HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1 increased endogenous JNK activity in primary neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1-induced JNK activation was inhibited either by the JNK inhibitor or an anti-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> function-blocking antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination of the anti-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> function-blocking antibody with expression of DSCAM shRNA in primary neurons totally abolished Netrin-1-induced JNK activation, whereas knockdown of DSCAM partially inhibited the Netrin-1 effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the developing spinal cord, phospho-JNK was strongly expressed in commissural axons before and as they crossed the floor plate, and Netrin-1 stimulation dramatically increased the level of endogenous phospho-JNK in commissural axon growth cones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of JNK signaling either by JNK1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference (RNAi) or the JNK inhibitor suppressed Netrin-1-induced neurite outgrowth and axon attraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of JNK1 in ovo caused defects in spinal cord commissural axon projection and pathfinding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study reveals that JNK1 is important in the coordination of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and DSCAM in Netrin-mediated attractive signaling </plain></SENT>
