<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Puerto Rico, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is the third leading cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in men and the second in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are limited published data on the prevalence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (CRN) among the US Hispanic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the prevalence of CRN (colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) among asymptomatic, Hispanic subjects who were screened in Puerto Rico and evaluated risk factors associated with CRN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the medical, endoscopic, and pathology records of individuals who underwent first-time screening colonoscopies at an ambulatory gastroenterology practice from January 1, 2008, to December 1, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CRN (overall and advanced), documented by colonoscopy and pathology reports, was calculated for the complete cohort and by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 745 Hispanic individuals who underwent screening colonoscopies during the study period, the prevalence for overall CRN was 25.1% and for advanced CRN (â‰¥ 1 cm and/or with advanced histology) was 4.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CRN was higher for men than women (32.0% vs 20.6%; P = .001; odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CRN was more frequently located in the proximal colon (67.7% proximal vs 32.3% distal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was associated with advanced CRN (odds ratio, 2.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-6.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CRN was more common among Hispanic men than women and increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CRNs among Hispanic individuals were predominantly located in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that there are ethnic and sex disparities in patterns of CRN that might be related to genomic admixture and have important implications for screening algorithms for Hispanic individuals </plain></SENT>
