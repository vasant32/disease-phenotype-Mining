<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: MET, the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, is frequently overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> with high metastatic tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the role of its negative regulators, miR-1 and miR-199a*, and its transcriptional activator, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-associated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> 1 (MACC1), in controlling MET expression in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of MET, miR-1, miR-199a*, and MACC1 was evaluated by real-time PCR in 52 matched pairs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and nontumoral surrounding tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biological role of miR-1 in controlling MET expression and biological activity was assessed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells either by its forced expression or by AntagomiR-mediated inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MiR-1 was downregulated in 84.6% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and its decrease significantly correlated with MET overexpression, particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that concurrent MACC1 upregulation and miR-1 downregulation are required to elicit the highest increase of MET expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a suppressive role of miR-1, its forced in vitro expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells reduced MET levels and impaired MET-induced invasive growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we identified a feedback loop between miR-1 and MET, resulting in their mutual regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies an oncosuppressive role of miR-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in which it acts by controlling MET expression through a feedback loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concomitant downregulation of miR-1 and increase of MACC1 can thus contribute to MET overexpression and to the metastatic behavior of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
