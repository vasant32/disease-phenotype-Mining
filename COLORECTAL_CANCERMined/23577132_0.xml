<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two allelic variants of the CYP2C9 gene, namely CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, differ from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CYP2C9*1 by single amino acid substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mutated alleles encode enzymes with altered properties that are associated with impaired metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the past decade, a number of case-control studies have been carried out to investigate the relationship between the CYP2C9 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility, but the results were conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate this inconsistency, we performed a meta-analysis of 13 studies involving a total of 20,879 subjects for CYP2C9*2 and *3 polymorphisms to evaluate the effect of CYP2C9 on genetic susceptibility for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the summary odds ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.87-1.03, P = 0.18) and 1.00 (95%CI: 0.86-1.16, P = 0.99) for CYP2C9 *2 and *3 carriers, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant results were observed in heterozygous and homozygous when compared with wild genotype for these polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the stratified analyses according to ethnicity, sample size, diagnostic criterion, HWE status and sex, no evidence of any gene-disease association was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our result suggest that the *2, *3 polymorphisms of CYP2C9 gene are not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
