<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multi-drug resistant cell line Lovo/5-FU was established by incubation with increasing dose of 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity to 5-FU and cis-diaminodichloroplatinum (CDDP) was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two dimensional electrophoresis plus mass spectrum(2-DE/MS) was used to identify the differentially expressed protein between Lovo and Lovo/5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identified protein was then verified by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IC50 concentrations of Lovo/5-FU to 5-FU and CDDP were increased by 31 and 3 times, compared with Lovo (both P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2DE-MS showed that CAP-G and RhoGDI2 were up-regulated, whereas 6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PGL</z:e>, DCI, Prdx-6 and Maspin were down-regulated in Lovo/5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis confirmed that the expression levels of RhoGDI2 and CAP-G in Lovo/5-FU were increased by 6.14 and 2.98 fold respectively (both P&lt;0.01), whereas Maspin was decreased to 5.2% of Lovo(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multi-gene and multi-pathway are involved in the development of multi-drug resistance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CAP-G, RhoGDI2 and Maspin are potential multi-drug resistant genes </plain></SENT>
