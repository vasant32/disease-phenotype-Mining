<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of modified Sijunzi Decoction (SJZD) on immune function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergoing chemotherapy (CM) with FOLFOX4 protocol (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> + calcium folinate + 5-fluorouracil) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomly assigned to two groups, the 22 in the control group treated with CM alone and the 23 in the treated group treated with CM plus SJZD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic course for both groups was 2 chemotherapy cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunologic indices, including T-lymphocyte subgroup and NK cell proportion were detected before and after treatment using immunofluorescence stain and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meantime, patients' quality of life (QOL) was scaled by KPS scoring, body mass was weighed, side and toxic effects of chemotherapy were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with pre-treatment, CD4 and CD4/CD8 significantly decreased after treatment in the control group (P &lt; 0.05), while in the treated group, CD3, CD4 and CD4/CD8 increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, CD4 and CD4/CD8 were much higher in the treated group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, the treated group had stabilized KPS score and body weight, and reduced chemotherapeutic toxicity shown as higher level of leucocyte amount, less symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SJZD could improve the immune function and QOL of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients undergoing FOLFOX4, and reduce the side effects of CM </plain></SENT>
