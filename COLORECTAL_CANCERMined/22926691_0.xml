<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identify the specific cytokines related to prognosis of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and assess their prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were divided into two groups according to their prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Difference in serum cytokine level between these groups was determined by the cytokine array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the specific cytokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha (MIP-3a) was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the sera of 242 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Several cytokines related to prognostic difference in stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median MIP-3a level (28.2 pg/ml) was used as a cut-off value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased MIP-3a was significantly associated with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, high MIP-3a was correlated with poor prognosis (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that high MIP-3a was an independent prognostic factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analysis, high MIP-3a was significantly associated with poor survival in patients with stage II, II/III, and IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum MIP-3a is not only an independent prognostic factor, but also an independent predictive factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, which may guide the decision making of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
