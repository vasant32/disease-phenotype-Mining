<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper reports a study examining the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) survival and access to healthcare in Texas using data from the Texas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We geo-referenced the data to the census tract level and used an enhanced 2-step floating catchment area method and factor analysis to estimate people's spatial and non-spatial access to healthcare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, Cox proportional hazard regression was employed to assess the influence of different factors on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival, and a spatial scan statistic was used to investigate the geographic disparity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival and the influence of access to healthcare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analyses revealed that Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks, and residents from several regions in Texas were more likely to die from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disadvantaged population groups based on factors rather than spatial access had an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spatial access to oncologists has a significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival in non-urban areas but not in urban areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Geographic disparities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival were largely influenced by factors rather than spatial access to healthcare </plain></SENT>
