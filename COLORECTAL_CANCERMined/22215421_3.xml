<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are statistically associated with low- to moderate-level risks of diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There has been limited study of complementarity for these two assessment methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk categorizations from FHRA and from Navigenics Personal Genome Screening (PGS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared FHRA with PGS for breast (22 females), prostate (22 males), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (44 males and females) assessed by kappa (κ) statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also assessed each participant's hereditary risk based on clinical criteria and/or gene-test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both FHRA and PGS placed 59%, 68% and 44% of participants into the same risk categories for breast, prostate, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, however, there was little concordance in FHRA versus PGS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risks (κ&lt;0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FHRA assigned 22 with hereditary risk compared with PGS, which identified one as high risk (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We assessed nine with hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, five with germline mutations, but none were classified as PGS high risk (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FHRA and PGS may be complementary tools for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, evaluation of family history remains the standard to evaluate an individual's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk until further research </plain></SENT>
