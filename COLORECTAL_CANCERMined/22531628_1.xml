<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of bevacizumab-induced arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> has recently been suggested as a potential predictive biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood pressure was recorded during the BOXER study, a phase II study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (CAPOX) plus bevacizumab as peri-operative treatment in 45 patients with poor-risk colorectal liver-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> unsuitable for upfront resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, the development of bevacizumab-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was correlated with clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen percent of patients developed â‰¥grade 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> while receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 4% developed grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and radiological response rate (P=0.642), progression-free survival (P=0.644) or overall survival (P=0.480) in those who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> compared with those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> did not predict radiological response or survival in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results highlight a number of important issues regarding the use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as a biomarker </plain></SENT>
