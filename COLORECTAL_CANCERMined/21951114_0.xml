<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to determine the current delay in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and establish whether there has been any improvement in the past 25 years in the same healthcare setting using the same methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: 152 patients undergoing surgery at our unit were personally interviewed during their hospital stay to determine the delay incurred for the diagnosis and treatment of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPSS software was used for univariate and multivariate analysis of the data obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the study population was comprised of 152 patients of mean age 71 years (SD 10; range 36 to 90 years), 82 men and 70 women (53.9 and 46.1% respectively; p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic delay for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at our unit currently runs at 7.28 months despite the fact that in 58% of patients the disease produced obvious symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although this delay in diagnosis is reduced over that observed 25 years ago, the difference is statistically not significant in terms of both doctor-attributed or patient-attributed delay (doctor-attributed delay was 3.28 months in 1985 versus 1.89 at present and patient-attributed delay was 3.18 months versus todayÂ´s 2.75; p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike the situation 25 years ago, no link was detected between diagnostic delay and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, stage D disease was diagnosed earlier (at 5.71 months) than stage A disease (at 11.16 months) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the diagnostic delay for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at our centre is 7.28 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This delay is excessive for a disease that produces evident symptoms in 90% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over the last 25 years little improvement has been noted in the overall delay in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, al though the delay attributed to the care provider has significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No relationship was detected between diagnostic delay and disease stage upon diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We feel the high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the failure of campaigns to increase awareness of early symptoms and no real improvement in its prognosis justify the introduction of large-scale colonoscopy screening for this disease </plain></SENT>
