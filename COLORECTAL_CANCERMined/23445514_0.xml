<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate OV-6 expression and its clinical implications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of OV-6 and its clinical implications were investigated in 94 patients with American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (AJCC) stage I-III primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and in 37 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who had received preoperative chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two main expression patterns of OV-6 were cytoplasmic and membranous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of OV-6, which was identified on the basis of overall staining intensity, was associated with perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and early relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Membranous OV-6 overexpression was also significantly associated with depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion, AJCC stage, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, and postoperative early relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly poorer in patients with high overall OV-6 expression than in those with low overall OV-6 expression (P = 0.015 and P = 0.029, respectively), and significantly poorer in patients with high membranous OV-6 expression than in those with low membranous OV-6 expression (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Membranous OV-6 expression was a more reliable prognostic marker than overall expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OV-6 is not unique to the hepatobiliary system, and may be a novel prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
