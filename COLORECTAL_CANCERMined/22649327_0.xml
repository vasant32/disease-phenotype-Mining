<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with lymph node harvest less than this may be considered under staged and may receive adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to ascertain median number of lymph nodes examined in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients undergoing colorectal resection between June 2007 and May 2008 were identified and pathological staging obtained using pathology database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 146 patients underwent standardised laparoscopic or open resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall median number of lymph nodes harvested/patient was 14 (3-40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When analysed by stage, median number of lymph nodes harvested in Dukes' A, B, and C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> was 10, 14, and 15, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>11/18 (61%) patients with Dukes' A <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> had lymph node harvest of less than 12 compared with 15/55 (27%) patients with Dukes' B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lymph node harvest in Dukes' A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> using standard techniques tends to be low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathologists may have to consider special techniques in harvesting lymph nodes for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
