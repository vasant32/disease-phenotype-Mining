<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, apatinib is undergoing phase II/III clinical trials in China for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apatinib is extensively metabolized in humans, and its major metabolites in circulation include cis-3-hydroxy-apatinib (M1-1), trans-3-hydroxy-apatinib (M1-2), apatinib-25-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxide</z:chebi> (M1-6), and cis-3-hydroxy-apatinib-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> (M9-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the pharmacokinetics of apatinib and its four major metabolites in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, a sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of apatinib, M1-1, M1-2, M1-6, and M9-2 in human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38560">simple protein</z:chebi> precipitation using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi> as the precipitation solvent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the analytes and the internal standard vatalanib were separated on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C(18) column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 1.8 μm, Agilent) using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi>: 5 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> with 0.1% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30751">formic acid</z:chebi> as the mobile phase with gradient elution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A chromatographic total run time of 9 min was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometry detection was conducted through electrospray ionization in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring modes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method was linear over the concentration range of 3.00-2000 ng/mL for each analyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lower limit of quantification for each analyte was 3.00 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intra-assay precision for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the analytes was less than 11.3%, the inter-assay precision was less than 13.8%, and the accuracy was between -5.8% and 3.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The validated method was successfully applied to a clinical pharmacokinetic study following oral administration of 500 mg apatinib mesylate in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
