<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclic [W(RW)(4)] and the corresponding linear <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (RW)(4) were conjugated with Dox through an appropriate linker to afford cyclic [W(RW)(4)]-Dox and linear (RW)(4)-Dox conjugates to enhance the cellular uptake and cellular retention of the parent drug for sustained anticancer activity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry analysis showed 3.6-fold higher cellular uptake of cyclic [W(RW)(4)]-Dox than Dox alone in SK-OV-3 cells after 24 h incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cellular hydrolysis study showed that 99% of cyclic [W(RW)(4)]-Dox was hydrolyzed intracellularly within 72 h and released Dox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that cyclic [W(RW)(4)]-Dox can be used as a potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> for improving the cellular delivery and retention of Dox </plain></SENT>
