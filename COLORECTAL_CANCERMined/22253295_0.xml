<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> is essential for one-carbon metabolism, a pathway required by DNA synthesis, methylation, and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low dietary and circulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and polymorphic variation in this pathway are associated with increased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 882 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 82 one-carbon metabolism genes for 1,331 cases of advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, identified by sigmoidoscopy at baseline, and 1,501 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ovarian Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial (PLCO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated associations between one-carbon genes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and stratified by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We applied the Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (ARTP) method to assess statistical significance at the gene and pathway levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> intake was inversely associated with advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk [odds ratio (OR) by quartile = 0.85, P = 1.9 × 10(-5)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no statistically significant associations between one-carbon genes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As hypothesized, we observed a statistically significant pathway-level association (P = 0.038) in the lowest quartile of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>; no significant associations were found in higher quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several genes including <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) and cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1) contributed to this signal (gene-level P = 0.001 and 0.0073, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most statistically significant SNP was rs244072 in <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> (P = 2.37 × 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPACT: Stratification by dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and application of the ARTP method revealed statistically significant pathway- and gene-level associations between one-carbon metabolism genes and risk of advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, which were not apparent in analysis of the entire population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> intake may interact with associations between common variants in one-carbon metabolism genes and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk </plain></SENT>
