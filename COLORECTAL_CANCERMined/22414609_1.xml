<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, the mutational status of the KRAS oncogene has become incorporated into standard medical care as a predictive marker for therapeutic decisions related to patients with metastasized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is necessary, because these patients benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy with increased progression-free survival only if the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> does not carry a mutation in KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many different analytical platforms, both those commercially available and those developed in house, have been used within pathology laboratories to assess KRAS mutational status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For a testing laboratory to become accredited to perform such tests, it is essential that they perform reliability testing, but it has not previously been possible to perform this kind of testing on the complete workflow on a large scale without compromising reproducibility or the mimicry of the control sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed a novel synthetic control for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples in a blind study conducted within nine laboratories across Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that FFPE material can, at least in part, mimic clinical samples and we demonstrate this control to be a valuable tool in the assessment of platforms used in testing for KRAS mutational status </plain></SENT>
