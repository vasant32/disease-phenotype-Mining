<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study identifies the claims made on the basis of delay in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> to the Swedish insurance agency (whose English name is The County Council´s Mutual Insurance Company) and the impact and consequences of the delay on prognosis, treatment and survival for patients who reported the claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Company handles claims of medical malpractice where claimants seek compensation for alleged suffering and/or negative clinical impacts of diagnostic delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2008, a total of 80 patients filed claims for negative effects resulting from delays in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Review of the claims led to identification of delay for 62 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms that were overlooked and other causes of delay that had any relation to therapy, prognosis and economic compensation were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median delay in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This delay was considered to have had an impact on the therapy in 20 % of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was postulated to have been adversely affected for 15 % of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The delay was mainly caused by incomplete consideration of the symptoms hematoschisis or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, changed bowel routine, or incomplete clinical or radiological examination and by misinterpretations of the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No impact of duration of delay on survival was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The importance of identifying concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> at diagnosis was overwhelming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Economic compensation was given in 79 % of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study found that claims for compensation for delay in diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The delay in the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> was considered to have had an impact on the magnitude of therapeutic measures for a fifth of the patients who filed claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Economic compensation for the patients´ injuries was given in almost 80 % of the cases </plain></SENT>
