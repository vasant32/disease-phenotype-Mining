<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Biological entities do not perform in isolation, and often, it is the nature and degree of interactions among numerous biological entities which ultimately determines any final outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, experimental data on any single biological entity can be of limited value when considered only in isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this, we propose that augmenting individual entity data with the literature will not only better define the entity's own significance but also uncover relationships with novel biological entities.To test this notion, we developed a comprehensive text mining and computational methodology that focused on discovering new targets of one class of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23367">molecular entities</z:chebi>, transcription factors (TF), within one particular disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used 39 molecular entities known to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> along with six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> terms as the bait list, or list of search terms, for mining the biomedical literature to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific genes and proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the literature-mined data, we constructed a global TF interaction network for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then developed a multi-level, multi-parametric methodology to identify TFs to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The small bait list, when augmented with literature-mined data, identified a large number of biological entities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative importance of these TF and their associated modules was identified using functional and topological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional validation of these highly-ranked TF using the literature strengthened our findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some of the novel TF that we identified were: SLUG, RUNX1, IRF1, HIF1A, ATF-2, ABL1, ELK-1 and GATA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some of these TFs are associated with functional modules in known pathways of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, including the Beta-catenin/development, immune response, transcription, and DNA damage pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our methodology of using text mining data and a multi-level, multi-parameter scoring technique was able to identify both known and novel TF that have roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Starting with just one TF (SMAD3) in the bait list, the literature mining process identified an additional 116 CRC-associated TFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our network-based analysis showed that these TFs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> belonged to any of 13 major functional groups that are known to play important roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among these identified TFs, we obtained a novel six-node module consisting of ATF2-P53-JNK1-ELK1-EPHB2-HIF1A, from which the novel JNK1-ELK1 association could potentially be a significant marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
