<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether long-term oncological outcomes are affected for patients who undergo repeat surgery in the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: From a prospective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> database, patients who underwent resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1982 and 2008 and were reoperated within 30 days after surgery (group A) were matched for age (±5 years), gender, year of surgery (±2 years), American Society of Anesthesiology score, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site (colon or rectum), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage and differentiation with patients who did not undergo reoperation (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were compared for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and local recurrence (LR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 89 reoperated patients (45 rectal, 44 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>) were matched to an equal number of non-reoperated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anterior resection (39.2%) and right hemicolectomy (19.1%) were predominant primary operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications for reoperation were anastomotic leak/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (n=40, 45%), massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (n=15, 16.9%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> (n=11, 12.4%), wound complications (n=9, 10.1%) and other indications (n=14, 15.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group A had significantly greater overall morbidity (100% vs 27%, P=0.001) and required more blood transfusions (20.2% vs 7.9%, P=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant therapy use, on the other hand, was more common in group B (23.6% vs 12.3%, P=0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year OS and DFS were lower in the reoperated group (OS 55.3% vs 66.4%, P=0.02; DFS 50.8% vs 60.8%, P=0.06, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five-year LR was slightly lower in the reoperated group (2.9% vs 6.3%, P=0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non-reoperated patients matched for patient, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and operative characteristics, patients reoperated in the early postoperative period have worse long-term oncological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Adoption of strategies to reduce the risk of reoperation may be associated with the additional advantage of improved oncological outcomes in addition to the short-term advantages </plain></SENT>
