<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to measure the amounts of pro-GRP-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, characterize the immunoreactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and investigate its effect on proliferation in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pro-GRP-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were quantitated by region-specific ELISA in extracts of five human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines and 20 tumors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactive material was purified by HPLC and its mass and sequence established by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of GRPamide was determined by RIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of DLD-1 cells and murine gastrointestinal mucosa was measured by [(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation and mitotic index, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was purified and identified as pro-GRP42-98 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resected stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> contained significantly less pro-GRP immunoreactivity than stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and no amidated GRP was detected in cell lines or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that nonamidated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from the C terminus of pro-GRP are expressed in significant quantities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and stimulate the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
