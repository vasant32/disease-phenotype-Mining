<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite compelling preclinical data in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), the efficacy of HDACIs has been disappointing in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vorinostat and panobinostat in a dose- and exposure-dependent manner in order to better understand the dynamics of drug action and antitumor efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a standard 72 h drug exposure MTS assay, notable concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects were observed in the IC(50) range of 1.2-2.8 μmol/L for vorinostat and 5.1-17.5 nmol/L for panobinostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, shorter clinically relevant exposures of 3 or 6 h failed to elicit any significant growth inhibition and in most cases a &gt;24 h exposure to vorinostat or panobinostat was required to induce a sigmoidal dose-response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed in colony formation assays where ≥24 h of exposure was required to effectively reduce colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-H3, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-H4 and p21 by vorinostat were transient and rapidly reversed within 12 h of drug removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, panobinostat-induced <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-H3, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-H4, and p21 persisted for 48 h after an initial 3 h exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of HCT116 xenografts with panobinostat induced significant increases in <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-H3 and downregulation of thymidylate synthase after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although HDACIs exert both potent growth inhibition and cytotoxic effects when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells were exposed to drug for ≥24 h, these cells demonstrate an inherent ability to survive HDACI concentrations and exposure times that exceed those clinically achievable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Continued efforts to develop novel HDACIs with improved pharmacokinetics/phamacodynamics, enhanced intratumoral delivery and class/isoform-specificity are needed to improve the therapeutic potential of HDACIs and HDACI-based combination regimens in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
