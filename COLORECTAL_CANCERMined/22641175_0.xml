<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have reported that the upregulation of UCHL1 is related to lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its molecular mechanisms remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we transfected pcDNA3.1/UCHL1 and the pcDNA3.1/UCHL1-C90S mutant into HCT8 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes in biological features in these stable transfectants were examined both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was used to analyze the changes in the β-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that UCHL1 re-expression promoted the proliferation, migration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> potential of HCT8 cells both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that UCHL1 could decelerate β-catenin degradation depending on its deubiquitinating activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The accumulated β-catenin consequently activated the β-catenin/TCF pathway and induced the expression of cyclin D1 and uPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations imply that UCHL1 may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression by activating the β-catenin/TCF pathway through its deubi-quitinating activity </plain></SENT>
