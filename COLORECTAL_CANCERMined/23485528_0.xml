<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been found on the membranes of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, acting as a receptor for a wide variety of ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its presence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell surface and its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> metastatic progression remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we reported that GRP78 was predominantly present in the form of clustering aggregates on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell surfaces, and its surface abundance was strongly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> differentiation stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we observed that cell-surface GRP78 had an interaction with the ECM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule Î²1-integrin and was involved in cell-matrix <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> through regulation of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase (FAK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the present data also implicated that surface GRP78 promoted the cell invasion process, and this effect was at least partly mediated through its association with uPA-uPAR protease system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, our data suggests that surface GRP78 promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell migration and invasion by regulating cell-matrix <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and ECM degradation, which is independent of its signaling receptor function </plain></SENT>
