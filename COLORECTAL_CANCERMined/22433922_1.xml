<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Several advanced imaging techniques have been developed to improve differentiation of colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These techniques need to be assessed for both feasibility and accuracy in order to prove their value in daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study assessed the feasibility of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) in acquiring videos of sufficient quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the accuracy of pCLE for the differentiation of colorectal lesions was assessed and compared with narrow-band imaging (NBI) and chromoendoscopy (CE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients scheduled for surveillance colonoscopy at our centre were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were performed by two expert colonoscopists, who previously participated in studies evaluating pCLE, NBI, and CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> detected lesions during colonoscopy were differentiated real-time with NBI and CE for Kudo pit pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions were also assessed real-time for vascular pattern intensity (VPI) during NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, pCLE videos of each lesion were acquired and biopsies were taken for histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pCLE videos were assessed post-hoc for the percentage of time demonstrating sufficient image quality (i.e., depicting at least one crypt or vessel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, pCLE videos were assessed post-hoc for diagnostic accuracy by two experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 154 lesions detected in 64 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of Kudo pit pattern with NBI for predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (88.7%) was significantly better than accuracy of VPI (77.5%, P = 0.05) but not significantly different from CE (89.3%, P = 0.125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During pCLE, no histology was shown at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> on the video in 19 lesions (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean time to acquire a pCLE video of the remaining 135 lesions was 50 seconds (s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>47) per lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The median percentage demonstrating sufficient quality per video was 40.5% (interquartile range 21.2-67.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of pCLE for both observers (66.7 and 71.9%) was significantly lower than accuracy of CE (P &lt; 0.001) and NBI (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Video acquisition with pCLE could not be achieved in a small number of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The majority of pCLE videos demonstrated insufficient quality in more than half of the time recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Moreover, post-hoc accuracy of pCLE was significantly lower in comparison with real-time accuracy of CE and NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Future research should assess whether further increase in experience could improve pCLE video acquisition and determine the real-time accuracy of pCLE for differentiating colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
