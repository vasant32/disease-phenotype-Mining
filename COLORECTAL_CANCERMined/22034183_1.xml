<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Complication management appears to be of vital importance to differences in survival following surgery between surgical units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Failure-to-rescue (FTR) rates have not yet distinguished surgical from general medical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether variability exists in FTR rates after reoperation for serious surgical complications following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections in England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database was used to identify patients undergoing primary resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 2000 and 2008 in English National Health Service (NHS) trusts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Units were ranked into quintiles according to overall risk-adjusted mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Highest and lowest mortality quintiles were compared with respect to reoperation rates and FTR-surgical (FTR-S) rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FTR-S was defined as the proportion of patients with an unplanned reoperation who died within the same admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some 144 542 patients undergoing resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 150 English NHS trusts were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On ranking according to risk-adjusted mortality, rates varied significantly between lowest and highest mortality quintiles (5·4 and 9·3 per cent respectively; P = 0·029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lowest and highest mortality quintiles had equivalent adjusted reoperation rates (both 4·8 per cent; P = 0·211) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FTR-S rates were significantly higher at units within the worst mortality quintile (16·8 versus 11·1 per cent; P = 0·002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FTR-S rates differed significantly between English colorectal units, highlighting variability in ability to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This variability may represent differences in serious surgical complication management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FTR-S represents a readily collectable marker of surgical complication management that is likely to be applicable to other surgical specialties </plain></SENT>
