<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is a marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> were shown to be the driving force of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> we suspected that the expression of ALDH1 correlated with the prognostic 5 year survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ALDH1 expression was analyzed in a highly stratified collective of 186 T3 N0 M0 G2 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens applying immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the analysis a scoring system for the expression of ALDH1 was developed that was aided by the pattern of the subcellular expression of beta-catenin which is a well known indicator for colorectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First, ALDH1 expression could be assigned to two groups which correlated with the absence or presence of nuclear beta-catenin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second, ALDH1 group 2 expression patterning correlated highly significantly with low long term survival (p=0.010) of patients with T3 N0 M0 G2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This correlation was found univariately and when applying the multivariate Cox-model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ALDH1 expression pattern is an independent prognostic marker for survival of T3 N0 M0 G2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
