<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates that mucosal healing may change the natural course of the disease by decreasing the need for surgery and reducing hospitalization rates in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mucosal healing may also prevent the development of long-term disease complications, such as bowel damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic healing may be the ultimate therapeutic goal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, whereas its impact on the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete mucosal healing may be required before considering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug withdrawal</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Targeting early <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is more effective than approaches aimed at healing mucosa in longstanding disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="?"><plain>Several questions remain to be answered: should mucosal healing be systematically used in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="?"><plain>Should we optimize therapies to achieve mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="?"><plain>What is the degree of intestinal healing that is required to change the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large prospective studies addressing these issues are needed </plain></SENT>
