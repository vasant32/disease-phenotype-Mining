<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>) has some particularities from point of view of epidemiology, clinical aspects, therapy and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATHERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the patients operated in the First Surgical Unit Ia≈üi during 2004 until 2009, for right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' data from the medical files were digitally encoded and included into a MS Access database, and statistically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 219 cases were included into the analysis, which represents 24.17% from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 66 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A palpable mass into the right abdominal quadrant was founded in 41.5% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in 65.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abdominal ultrasound exam has been performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, with 71.3% sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> positive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resectability was 89.5% but without multivisceral resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intraoperative complication rate was 6.8%; postoperative morbidity was 19.4% with an incidence of anastomotic leak of 1.38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative mortality rate was 2.77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean overall survival was 40.13 +/- 1.93 months (median: 49.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prognosis factors for the survival rate were: histologic type of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grading, vascular and perineural invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in more than 3 lymphnodes as well as resection of fewer than 11 lymphnodes were found as negative prognosis factors for the survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> has an increasing incidence and it is associated especially with elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> resectability is about 90% with acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Perineural and vascular invasion as well as rate of positive lymphnodes and count of resected lymphnodes are prognosis factor for overall survival rate </plain></SENT>
