<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Deficiency or reduced expression of signal transduction and activation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> family protein Quaking (Qki) is associated with developmental defects in neural and vascular tissues and the development of debilitating human diseases including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying the aberrant downregulation or deficiency of Qki were uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Expression of miR-574-5p, Qki5/6/7/7b splicing variants, β-catenin and p27(Kip1) was determined in mouse and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and tissues to investigate the post-transcriptional regulation of Qki isoforms by miR-574-5p and its impact on β-catenin/p27(Kip1) signalling, cell cycle progression, proliferation, migration, invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues of C57BL/6-Apc(min/+) mice, miR-574-5p was found to be significantly upregulated and negatively correlated with the expression of Qki but positively correlated with the expression of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In mouse and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, miR-574-5p was shown to regulate Qki isoforms (Qki6/7 in particular) post-transcriptionally and caused altered expression in β-catenin and p27(Kip1) , increased proliferation, migration and invasion and decreased differentiation and cell cycle exit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues, miR-574-5p was shown to be greatly upregulated and inversely correlated with the expression of Qkis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, inhibition of miR-574-5p was shown to suppress the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Together, these novel findings suggest that miR-574-5p is a potent ribo-regulator for Qkis and that aberrant miR-574-5p upregulation can be oncogenic </plain></SENT>
