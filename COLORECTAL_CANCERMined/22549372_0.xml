<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is expressed by endothelial cells and other tissues in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both intact ANGPTL4 and its partly degraded C-terminal fragment may promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study had two purposes: to measure and compare preoperative plasma ANGPTL4 levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and benign colorectal disease (BCD) and to determine plasma levels after minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma was obtained from an IRB-approved plasma/data bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative plasma ANGPTL4 levels were measured for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and BCD patients, but postoperative levels were determined only for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients for whom a preoperative, a postoperative day (POD) 3, and at least one late postoperative sample (POD 7-55) were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late samples were bundled into four time blocks and considered as single time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ANGPTL4 levels (mean ± SD) were measured via ELISA and compared (significance, p &lt; 0.01 after Bonferroni correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (71 % colon, 29 % rectal) and 60 BCD (62 % <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e>, 38 % <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>) patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean preoperative plasma ANGPTL4 level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (247.2 ± 230.7 ng/ml) was lower than the BCD group result (330.8 ± 239.0 ng/ml, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relationship between plasma levels and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as judged by three criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In regard to the postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> analysis, the "n" for each time point varied: lower plasma levels (p &lt; 0.001) were noted on POD 3 (161.4 ± 140.4 ng/ml, n = 80), POD 7-13 (144.6 ± 134.5 ng/ml, n = 46), POD 14-20 (139.0 ± 117.8 ng/ml, n = 27), POD 21-27 (138.9 ± 202.4, n = 20), and POD 28-55 (160.1 ± 179.0, n = 42) when compared to preoperative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is associated with lower preoperative plasma ANGPTL4 levels compared with BCD, and the levels may vary inversely with disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After MICR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, levels are significantly lower for over a month compared with the preoperative level; the cause for this persistent decrease is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The implications of both the lower preoperative level and the persistently decreased postoperative levels are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed </plain></SENT>
