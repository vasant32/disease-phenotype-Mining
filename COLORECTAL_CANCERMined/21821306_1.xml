<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze our initial experience with this aggressive strategy, and to define the prognosis and the surgical indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 35 patients who underwent surgical treatments for both hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, from January 1997 to December 2008, were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 18 females and 17 males with a median age was 62.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was located at the colon in 23 patients (65.7%) and in the rectum in 12 patients (34.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 65.3% and 31.5% from the date of primary colorectal resection, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients who underwent metachronous hepatic and pulmonary surgical treatment, the 10-year survival rate was 40.9%, which was significantly better than that of those undergoing synchronous hepatic and pulmonary surgical treatment (p=0.0265) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who have pulmonary less than ten of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> thus seemed to have a better prognosis than those with more than ten, but the difference was quite significant (p=0.0719) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, synchronous hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> was identified as an independent predictor of adverse survival (p=0.0073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that hepatic and pulmonary surgical treatment can provide a better prognosis for patients with metachronous hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that aggressive metastasectomy can be an option for selected patients, even if a patient has been previously treated for hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
