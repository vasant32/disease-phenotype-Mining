<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to examine factors contributing to the observed stage IIB outcome, specifically nodal harvest, receipt of chemotherapy, and use of a new coding system to derive stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The provincial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases diagnosed during the study period and staged this cohort using the Collaborative Stage (CS) Data Collection System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the cohort were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves compared 5-year OS for patients with stage IIB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> based on the factors of interest, and compared patients with stage IIB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> to those with stage IIA and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OS for patients with stage IIB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 187) was 44.7%, and differed depending on adequacy of nodal harvest (P = .005) and whether pathological or clinical/mixed evidence was used to derive stage (P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathologically-staged patients with stage IIB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> who had adequate nodal harvest had marginally improved OS compared to pathologically-staged patients who had inadequate nodal harvest (P = .07), and improved survival compared to patients with clinical/mixed stage (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathologically-staged patients with stage IIB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with adequate nodal harvest demonstrated similar 5-year OS to those with stage IIA and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (P = .52 and P = .25, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models supported these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of clinical/mixed evidence into staging classification and, perhaps to a lesser extent, the adequacy of nodal harvest appear to contribute to the observed worse survival for patients with stage IIB versus stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
