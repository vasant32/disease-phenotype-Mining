<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Laparoscopic colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is associated with definite short-term benefits, and is increasingly practised worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The limitations of a pure laparoscopic approach include a relative lack of tactile feedback and long procedural time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery was introduced in an attempt to facilitate operation by improving the tactile sensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, there is no consensus as to which approach is better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein we conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy (HALC) with total laparoscopic colectomy (TLC) in the management of right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the caecum and ascending colon were recruited and randomized to undergo either HALC or TLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measured outcomes included operative time, blood loss, conversion rate, postoperative morbidities, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, disease recurrence and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients (HALC=30, TLC=30) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two groups were comparable with regard to age, gender distribution, body mass index and final histopathological staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between the groups in terms of operating time, conversion rate, operative blood loss, pain score and length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 27 to 33 months, no difference was observed in terms of disease recurrence, and the 5-year survival rates remained similar (83%vs 80%, P=0.923) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HALC is safe and feasible, but it does not show any significant benefits over TLC in terms of operating time and conversion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Routine use of the hand-assisted laparoscopic technique in right hemicolectomy is therefore not recommended </plain></SENT>
