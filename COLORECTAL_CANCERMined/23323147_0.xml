<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The discovery of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of cellular targets and the rational generation of selective targeting agents has opened an era of new opportunities and extraordinary challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specificity of these agents renders them capable of specifically targeting the inherent abnormalities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, potentially resulting in less toxicity than traditional nonselective cytotoxics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the many new types of rationally designed agents are therapeutics targeting various strategic facets of growth signal transduction, malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, survival, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and cell-cycle regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of these agents is likely to require some changes from the traditional drug development paradigms to realize their full potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor and the vascular endothelial growth factor have provided proof of principle that disruption of signal cascades in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This experience has also taught us that resistance to such rationally developed targeted therapeutic strategies is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this article, we review the role of signal transduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, introduce promising molecular targets, and outline therapeutic approaches under development </plain></SENT>
