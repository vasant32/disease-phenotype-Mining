<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several methodologies and complementary protocols have been previously implemented and has provided significant prediction results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the previously implicated prediction methods were capable of investigating the most likely deleterious nsSNPs, but due to the lack of genotype-phenotype association analysis, the prediction results lacked in accuracy level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work we implemented the computational compilation of protein conformational changes as well as the probable disease-associated phenotypic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our result suggested E403K mutation in mitotic centromere-associated kinesin protein as highly damaging and showed strong concordance to the previously observed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mutations aggregation tendency and energy value changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the molecular dynamics simulation results showed major loss in conformation and stability of mutant N-terminal kinesin-like domain structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The result obtained in this study will provide future prospect of computational approaches in determining the SNPs that may affect the native conformation of protein structure and lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated disorders </plain></SENT>
