<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, specific wait times for colonoscopy among patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outpatient cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed at colonoscopy in London, Ontario, in 2010 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wait times from the date of referral to colonoscopy were reviewed and compared with maximal wait times established by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) stratified according to indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> stage at the time of diagnosis was compared with colonoscopy wait times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 106 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six per cent of patients waited longer than CAG targets, with a mean (± SD) wait time of 79 ± 101 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage was associated with shorter wait time, likely as a result of triaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long wait times for diagnostic colonoscopy among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remain an issue, with a significant proportion of cases not meeting maximal CAG wait time targets </plain></SENT>
