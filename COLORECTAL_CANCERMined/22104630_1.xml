<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that migrants have lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality rates compared to the Australian-born population, particularly for colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo>, which are associated with an affluent lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study seeks to update knowledge in this field by examining mortality from colorectal, stomach, lung, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancers</z:e>, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> combined between 1981 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average annual age and sex-standardised mortality rates were calculated for each region of birth, period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Generally, mortality rates declined over the study period for most conditions for the majority of migrant groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notable exceptions included migrants from South Eastern Europe and Eastern Europe who experienced a significant increase in mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> combined and Australian-born individuals who recorded a significant increase in mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> of the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Migrants generally had more favourable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality outcomes, particularly for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Migrants from Southern Europe, South Eastern Europe, Chinese Asia and Southern Asia had the greatest advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, migrants displayed higher rates of stomach, lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancers</z:e> than the Australian-born population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The migrant advantage can in part be explained by the protective effects of diet, lifestyle and reproductive behaviours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations for why some migrants display greater mortality from stomach and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> include the consumption of abrasive, salted and preserved foods and higher rates of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Greater emphasis should be placed on targeting at-risk migrant groups through screening and education programs at migrant resource centres and community groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study calls for further research to explain the observed trends, which has the potential to uncover important risk and protective factors </plain></SENT>
