<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2006 to 2009, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were prospectively included in a phase II trial evaluating the combination of irinotecan and cetuximab every second week, as third-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FDG PET/CT was performed between 1 and 14 d before the first treatment and after every fourth treatment cycle until progression was identified by CT with Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> (RECIST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response evaluation with (18)F-FDG PET/CT was retrospectively performed according to both EORTC criteria and PERCIST, classifying the patients into 4 response categories: complete metabolic response (CMR), partial metabolic response (PMR), stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e>), and progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> (PMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual best overall metabolic response (BOmR) was registered with both sets of criteria, as well as survival within response categories, and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 61 patients and 203 PET/CT scans were eligible for response evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With EORTC criteria, 38 had PMR, 16 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e>, and 7 had PMD as their BOmR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With PERCIST, 34 had PMR, 20 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e>, and 7 had PMD as their BOmR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was agreement between EORTC criteria and PERCIST in 87% of the patients, and the corresponding κ-coefficient was 0.76 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disagreements were confined to PMR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) in months with EORTC criteria was 14.2 in the PMR group and 7.2 in the combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e> + PMD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With PERCIST, it was 14.5 in the PMR group and 7.9 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e> + PMD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Response evaluation with EORTC criteria and PERCIST gave similar responses and OS outcomes with good agreement on BOmR (κ-coefficient, 0.76) and similar significant differences in median OS between response groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compared with EORTC criteria, we find PERCIST unambiguous because of clear definitions and therefore more straightforward to use </plain></SENT>
