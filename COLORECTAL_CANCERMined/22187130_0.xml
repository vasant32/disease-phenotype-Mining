<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the risk factors affecting long-term outcomes of patients with pT1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> have been unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to identify risk factors for postoperative recurrence and overall survival in patients with pT1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1990 and January 2003, a total of 284 patients with pT1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> underwent radical surgery in the authors' institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of clinicopathological factors on postoperative recurrence and overall survival was estimated by univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 55 months (interquartile range: 47.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative recurrence occurred in 8 (2.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year and 10-year disease-free survival rates were 98.4 and 92.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed the presence of lymphatic invasion only was an independent risk factor for postoperative recurrence in pT1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (hazard ratio: 11.622; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year and 10-year disease-free survival rates of the patients in N-ly- group, the N-ly + group, and the N+ group were 99.5%/98.2% and 96.3%/75.2%, and 93.3%/93.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 4 of the 8 recurrences were found more than 5 years after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lymphatic invasion was an independent risk factor for recurrence in pT1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
