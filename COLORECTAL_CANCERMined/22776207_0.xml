<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those who have been previously referred and investigated for suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may present one group that does not warrant repeat urgent referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper aims to identify the incidence and diagnostic yield of repeat CRC2ww referrals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method:  <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CRC2ww patients referred to our unit over a 4-year period were identified retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Referral indication, outcome and instances of repeat referral were identified from MDT, endoscopy and imaging databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results:  2735 CRC2ww referrals were made over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 122 were repeated CRC2ww referrals, with the incidence increasing from 2% in 2008 to 6% in 2010 (p=0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time to repeat referral was 1070 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>267 cancers were detected after initial referral, including 212 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield was lower but not significantly so after repeated referral (6 cancers) compared with initial referral (5% vs 10%, p=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  The incidence of repeat referral is low but the diagnostic yield is not insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exclusion of these patients from urgent assessment and investigation will not significantly reduce workload and may risk missing some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>. © 2012 The Authors Colorectal Disease © 2012 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland </plain></SENT>
