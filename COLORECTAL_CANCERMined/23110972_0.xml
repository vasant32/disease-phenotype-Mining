<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sufficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> (LR) is essential for a successful outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) reduces the growth of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> also acts as a regulator of <z:mp ids='MP_0003333'>liver fibrosis</z:mp> and potentially LR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>, significantly inhibits the growth of CRCLM, but its effect on LR remains undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After 70% of partial hepatectomy, mice were randomly assigned to control or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LR was measured by liver-to-body weight ratio on days 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hepatocyte proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell size, hepatic stellate cell (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) count, and sinusoidal endothelial cell density were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) protein levels, liver injury markers, and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> levels were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At day 2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> increased liver-to-body weight ratio (56.5 ± 1.7 captopril versus 49.3 ± 2.4 control, P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was associated with increased <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> count (65.4 ± 4.8 cells per 100,000 μm(2), 48.7 ± 2.3, P = 0.007) and MMP-9 levels (0.68 ± 0.12 AU, 0.12 ± 0.04, P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (P = 0.045) and angiotensin 1 receptor (P = 0.039) were reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> at day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">Captopril</z:chebi> enhanced early LR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This effect was associated with increased <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> numbers and MMP-9 protein, whereas hepatocyte proliferation was lower than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">Captopril</z:chebi> may provide a beneficial treatment option for the management of patients with CRCLM </plain></SENT>
