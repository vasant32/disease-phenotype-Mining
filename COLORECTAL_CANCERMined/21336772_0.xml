<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the clinical outcomes of patients with BM from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) to assess the benefit of systemic chemotherapy (CT) administered after surgical or radiotherapeutic control of BM and to identify independent prognostic factors associated with survival after BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between August 2001 and July 2009, 118 patients with symptomatic BM from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> received either cranial irradiation or craniotomy at two large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers in South Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospective review and statistical analysis of clinical characteristics and outcomes were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median time from diagnosis of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> to detection of BM was 12.2 months (range 0-76.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (11%) exhibited brain involvement at initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median survival after BM development was 4.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-4.9 months] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients (40%) had been treated previously with the chemotherapeutic agents fluoropyrimidine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who received CT after BM exhibited significantly improved survival compared with those who did not (12.4 versus 3.1 months, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that CT intervention after presentation with BM was significantly associated with survival after BM, and the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.30 (95% CI 0.17-0.51, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although BM is a late-stage phenomenon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, approximately two-thirds of patients were still unexposed to irinotecan or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> at the development of BM in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, additional chemotherapeutic intervention after BM associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may be beneficial for selected patients </plain></SENT>
