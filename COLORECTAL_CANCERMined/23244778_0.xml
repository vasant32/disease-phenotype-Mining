<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic literature search according to the PRISMA guidelines was conducted using the PubMed database of the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>National library of Medicine using the keywords: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, extra-hepatic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e>, cytoreductive surgery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>), HIPEC and combinations hereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Papers focussing on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and HIPEC for PM combined with curative treatment of CRLM were included, provided sufficient information on survival outcomes could be extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Duplicate publications were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis was performed using the method described by Tierney et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After screening and full-text assessment of 39 papers, six articles were included containing data on combined PM and CRLM in patients treated with curative resection of both sites and HIPEC or early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three articles provided enough statistical information for meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pooled hazard ratio (HR) was extracted from survival curves and was 1.24 (CI 0.96-1.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A comparison was made with patients presenting with isolated PM undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and HIPEC and with patients with disseminated disease undergoing (modern) systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of randomized controlled studies, we found in this systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with a combination of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in the liver as well as in the peritoneum show a trend towards a lower overall survival after curative resection and HIPEC, when compared to patients with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and HIPEC (pooled HR1.24, CI 0.96-1.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> show a tendency towards increased median overall survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and HIPEC combined with resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> when compared to treatment with modern systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
