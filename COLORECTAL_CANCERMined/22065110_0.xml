<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although the regional lymph node status is essential for staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the importance of the total number of collected nodes remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the impact of the metastatic lymph node ratio (LNR) on the survival of patients with Dukes C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with Dukes C histology were selected from a prospectively collected database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> resected between 1997 and 2007 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic, histopathological and adjuvant treatment data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total number of positive lymph nodes was divided by the total number of lymph nodes examined to calculate the LNR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorised into LNR groups 1 to 5 according to cut-off points: ≤0.1, 0.21, 0.36, 0.6 and ≥0.61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival from the date of operation was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was performed to identify those factors influencing survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,098 patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections, 41% were staged as Dukes C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four percent of patients received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median number of lymph nodes harvested and positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> were 11 (range 1-52) and 4 (range 1-28), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients who received chemotherapy, 5-year survival was 69.3% for LNR 1 and 23.6% for LNR 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When no chemotherapy was given, the 5-year survival was 43.1% for LNR 1 and 8.7% for LNR 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current evaluation of positive lymph nodes may not accurately stage Dukes C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The assessment of the LNR is a useful prognostic method in this heterogenous group of patients </plain></SENT>
