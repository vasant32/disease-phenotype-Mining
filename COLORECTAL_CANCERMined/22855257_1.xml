<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data included 150,912 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50 and 79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify risk factors independently associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> during a median follow-up time of 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,210 women developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 282 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven risk factors were independently associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> at the p &lt; 0.001 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In decreasing order of associated χ(2) values, they were age, waist girth (especially for subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), use of hormone therapy at baseline (protective), years smoked, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (protective presumably because of medications used for treatment), relatives with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, lower hematocrit levels, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, less use of sleep medication, and cholecystectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 factors, three were significantly associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>: age, waist, and not taking hormone therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results provide additional support for the importance of waist girth, hormone therapy, smoking, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and cholecystectomy as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some factors previously identified as influencing risk (exercise and black race) did not have a strong independent association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in this analysis </plain></SENT>
