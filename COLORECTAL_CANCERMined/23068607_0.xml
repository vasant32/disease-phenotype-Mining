<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Investigation of NDRG2 molecular interactions by yeast two-hybrid screening identified prenylated Rab acceptor-1 (PRA1), involved in vesicle trafficking and protein transport, as binding partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding of NDRG2 (and NDRG1-4) with PRA1 in vitro was confirmed by GST pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation, and colocalization was verified by confocal microscopy in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular coexpression showed that NDRG2 and PRA1 synergistically downregulate T-cell factor (TCF) promoter activity and GSK3β phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that NDRG2 and PRA1 might act synergistically to prevent signaling of TCF/β-catenin </plain></SENT>
