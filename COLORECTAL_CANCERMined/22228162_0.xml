<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relative roles of microsatellite instability and epigenetic instability in the development of synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of medical records with histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular examination of stored tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The study took place at Seoul National University Hospital, Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 46 patients with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and 105 patients with solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics including microsatellite instability, mismatch repair gene expression, CpG island methylator phenotype, and mutation of KRAS and BRAF were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were more likely to be men than those with solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and had a tendency toward colocalization of individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the left or right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSI-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were more frequent in synchronous than in solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of CpG island methylator phenotype-high and KRAS and BRAF mutations were not different between synchronous and solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences between synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were observed in overall survival or progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Within the synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> group, patients with individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> discordant for microsatellite instability status had the worst clinical outcome, whereas those with individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> concordant for microsatellite instability-deficient status had the best clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by its retrospective nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis was performed only on cancerous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that microsatellite instability plays a more important role than does epigenetic instability in the development of synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, and that information regarding concordant or discordant microsatellite instability status between individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> might help to predict clinical outcome of synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
