<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> have been linked to the regulation of circulating hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), an adipose tissue-derived cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the CYP19A1 gene which alters sex hormones production may influence HGF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between the CYP19A1 gene variants and plasma HGF concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We evaluated 45 common and putative functional variants of CYP19A1 and circulating levels of HGF among 260 postmenopausal women who later developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the distribution of HGF levels was highly skewed, we transformed HGF concentrations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women into a log-, ranked-, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> score-scale value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression with adjustment for age was used to evaluate the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed an association between the rs7172156, rs1008805, rs6493494, rs749292, and rs11636639 variants and HGF levels in ranked and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> score scales (corrected p values ≤0.02), although the association of these 5 SNPs with log-scale HGF was not significant (corrected p values ≥0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The associations remained unchanged after additional adjustment for hormone therapy use and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These 5 SNPs, which were in linkage disequilibrium (pairwise D'≥97%, r(2)≥56%), constituted a block with 2 common haplotypes accounting for 82% frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common haplotype, TCCCA, was associated with lower ranked- or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> score-transformed HGF levels (corrected p values ≤0.001), whereas the second most common haplotype, CTTCA, was associated with higher ranked- or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> score-transformed HGF levels (corrected p values ≤0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings of a potential association between the CYP19A1 variants and circulating HGF levels warrant confirmation in studies with larger sample size </plain></SENT>
