<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive factors of failure of two-stage hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between 2000 and 2010, 48 patients with irresectable CLM were eligible for two-stage hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The planned strategy was a) cleaning of the left hepatic lobe (first hepatectomy), b) right portal vein embolisation and c) right hepatectomy (second hepatectomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients had occult CLM (n = 5) or extra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e> (n = 1), which was discovered during the first hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, 42 patients completed the first hepatectomy and underwent portal vein embolisation in order to receive the second hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients did not undergo a second hepatectomy due to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Upon univariate analysis, two factors were identified that precluded patients from having the second hepatectomy: the combined resection of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> during the first hepatectomy (p = 0.01) and administration of chemotherapy between the two hepatectomies (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An independent association with impairment to perform the two-stage strategy was demonstrated by multivariate analysis for only the combined resection of the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during the first hepatectomy (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the small number of patients and the absence of equivalent conclusions in other studies, we cannot recommend performance of an isolated colorectal resection prior to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, resection of an asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> before chemotherapy should not be considered as an outdated procedure </plain></SENT>
