<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite recent advances, there is a compelling need to better characterize prognostic markers for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates protein expression of NHERF1, HIF-1α and TWIST1 and their relationship in distant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (DNM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (T) and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (ANM), lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (LNM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (LM), determining their role as potential markers in advanced stages of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of nuclear NHERF1 was shown in 47% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, which exhibited a significant association with poor histological grade (P=0.0346) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear NHERF1 showed a higher expression in T, LNM and LM than both DNM (P&lt;0.0001) and ANM (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear HIF-1α was significantly higher in T, LNM and LM than DNM and ANM (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between nuclear NHERF1 and nuclear HIF-1α was found in LNM (r=0.331, P=0.020), where an extended co-localization of the two proteins was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TWIST1 was more expressed in T than DNM and ANM (P&lt;0.0001) and was higher in T than LNM and LM (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, nuclear NHERF1 was directly correlated to TWIST1 (r=0.339, P=0.015) in T samples, where a high co-expression of the two proteins was demonstrated both in no longer polarized epithelial cells and in invasive mesenchymal elements adjacent to hypoxic and perinecrotic colonic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, nuclear NHERF1 expression was associated with poorer differentiation grade and with higher expression both of HIF-1α in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic metastasis</z:e> and TWIST1 in invasive front of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results support the oncogenic role of NHERF1 and promote nuclear NHERF1 as a potential new biomarker of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
