<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgery is the primary treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> for both curative and palliative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Availability of high quality surgery data is essential for assessing many aspects of the quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the quality of different administrative data sources in identifying surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with respect to completeness and accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> residents in Alberta, Canada who were diagnosed with invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in years 2000-2005 were identified from the Alberta <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery data for these patients were obtained from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (which collects the date of surgery for which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> was removed) and compared to surgery data obtained from two different administrative data sources: Physician Billing and Hospital Inpatient data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and observed agreement were calculated compared to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Physician Billing data alone or combined with Hospital Inpatient data demonstrated equally high sensitivity (97% for both) and observed agreement with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry data (93% for both) for identifying surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Hospital Inpatient data, however, had the highest specificity (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value varied by disease stage and across data sources for stage IV (99% for stages I-III and 83-89% for stage IV), the specificity is better for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> surgeries (72-85%) than for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> surgeries (60-73%); validation measures did not vary over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Physician Billing data identify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery more completely than Hospital Inpatient data although both sources have a high level of completeness </plain></SENT>
