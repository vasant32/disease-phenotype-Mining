<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic salvage surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is a novel but technically challenging option for surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic surgery in patients with recurrent or metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in comparison with an open approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data used in this study were obtained from databases, the data of which were collected prospectively from January 1996 to February 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data pertaining to patients, operations, and short-term outcomes were analyzed and compared between open and laparoscopic salvage groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 3,425 patients studied, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> recurred in 565 patients (16.5%) and 41 patients had colorectal salvage operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients with recurrence underwent open surgery and 15 cases underwent laparoscopic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The short-term outcomes of the laparoscopic group were comparable with those of the open surgery group or were partly favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The five-year disease-free interval and overall survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent cancer</z:e> patients were not significantly different from those of the open patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> occurred in 13 patients (0.38%), 5 of whom had open surgery and 6 had laparoscopic salvage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only significant difference between the groups was a shorter operating time for the laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Late in the study, four patients in the laparoscopic recurrent group and one patient in the metachronous group were converted to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery yielded short-term outcomes that were comparable to those of conventional open surgery, in both recurrent and metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, minimally invasive salvage approaches should be considered as a treatment option for the recurrent and the metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
