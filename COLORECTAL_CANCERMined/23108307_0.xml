<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adipocytokines are primarily adipocyte-derived products, although certain members are also synthesized by other cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These adipocytokines, similarly to classical cytokines, are characterized by very pleiotropic functions affecting biological processes throughout the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of adipocytokines has recently been recognized, such as adiponectin, leptin, pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor/Nampt/visfatin, resistin, progranulin, and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin has emerged as the most abundant circulating adipocytokine, is produced almost exclusively by adipocytes, and has mainly anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, leptin is produced by many cell types beyond adipocytes, regulates immunity and T cell functions, and acts in a more pro-inflammatory fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adipocytokines play a fundamental role in adipose tissue homeostasis (i.e. health) and disease, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related disorders such as non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> diseases (NAFLD) and their complications, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lack of adiponectin as observed in NAFLD drives <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the liver, and evidence is increasing that this adipocytokine has many anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> properties and might play a rather protective role in <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of leptin in NAFLD is still unclear and this adipocytokine seems to have opposite effects in <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>, acting more as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence is increasing that <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> tissue produces various adipocytokines, and adiponectin expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> seems to be decreased whereas leptin expression is rather increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, adipocytokines are increasingly recognized as pleiotropic molecules involved in the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>, which might lead to therapeutic approaches targeting these mediators </plain></SENT>
