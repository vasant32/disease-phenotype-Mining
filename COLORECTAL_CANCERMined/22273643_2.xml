<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect 4 MicroRNA (miRNA) in the stool samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients to determine whether these miRNAs could be biomarkers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective comparison study was carried out in the Department of Colorectal Surgery, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China from September 2009 to March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We detected 4 miRNAs (miR-143, miR-145, miR-21, and miR-106a) in the stool samples of 38 CRC patients and 13 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from the stool samples was extracted using the EZNA TM stool <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> kit R6828-01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The miRNA quantification was carried out using TaqMan miRNA assays and the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-143 and miR-145 in the stool of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were lower than in those of the healthy persons (p&lt;0.005, median of 2-∆∆ct) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found in the expression levels of both miR-21 and miR-106a between the stool of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and those of the healthy persons (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The detection of fecal miRNAs is a potential method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis or screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Particularly, the down-regulation of fecal miR-143 and miR-145 could be a potential marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
