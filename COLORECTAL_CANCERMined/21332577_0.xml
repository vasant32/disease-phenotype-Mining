<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Men have higher incidence and mortality rates for nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and frequently use health behaviours that reflect their masculinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There has been minimal investigation into the influence of gender on the experience of a 'shared' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From November 2006 to November 2008, a qualitative study was conducted involving 38 individuals (24 men, 14 women) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were generated using semi-structured interviews at four time points over an 18-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This paper reports the participants' experience at diagnosis and during surgery (time point 1) with the purpose of examining the impact of gender on this experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: In general, men appeared more accepting of their diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of females seemed more emotional and more affected by the physical side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was variation in both gender groups, with some men and women portraying both 'masculine' and 'feminine' traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also individual variation in relation to context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It appears that many men may have been experiencing side effects and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> that they were reluctant to discuss, particularly as some men portrayed typical 'masculine' traits in public, but felt able to open up in private </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nurses should not make assumptions based on the traditional view of masculinity, and should determine how each man wants to deal with their diagnosis and not presume that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men need to 'open up' about their illness </plain></SENT>
