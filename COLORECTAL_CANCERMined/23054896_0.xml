<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: With modern multimodality therapy, patients with resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) can experience up to 50-60Â % 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These improved outcomes have become more commonplace via achievements in multidisciplinary care, improved definition of resectability, and advances in technical skill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Even patients with synchronous and/or extensive bilateral disease have benefited from novel surgical strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment sequencing of synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with CLM can be simplified into the following three paradigms: (classic colorectal-first), simultaneous (combined), or reverse approach (liver-first) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decision of whether to treat the CLM or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> first depends on which site dominates oncologically and symptomatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin (FOLFOX) and irinotecan with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin (FOLFIRI) are the foundations of modern chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although each regimen has positively impacted survivals, both have the potential for negative effects on the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor liver</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi> is associated with vascular injury (sinusoidal ballooning, microvascular injury, nodular regenerative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, and long-term <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>) but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan has been associated with steatohepatitis, especially in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Steatohepatitis from irinotecan is the only chemotherapy-associated liver injury (CALI) associated with increased mortality from postoperative hepatic insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extended duration of preoperative chemotherapy is also associated with CALI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To determine resectability and to prevent overtreatment with systemic therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients should receive high-quality cross-sectional imaging and be evaluated by a hepatobiliary surgeon before starting chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even as chemotherapy improves, liver surgeons will continue to play a central role in treatment planning by offering the best chance for prolonged survival-safe R0 resection with curative intent </plain></SENT>
