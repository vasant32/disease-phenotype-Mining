<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was conducted using the gastroenterology and endoscopy unit electronic data base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> and colonoscopy were regarded as cases and those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> and colonoscopy as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were matched for age, sex, colonoscopy purpose and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was the risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, advanced lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk was expressed as odds ratio (OR) with the respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 178 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> patients, 44 were included as cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> patients were included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cases, the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and advanced colonic lesions was 20%, 16% and 4.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In controls, it was 15%, 9% and3.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and advanced colonic lesions was similar in both groups: OR 1.48 (95% CI 0.59-3.73), OR 1.89 (95% CI 0.66-5.42) and OR 1.34 (95% CI 0.26-7.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> within this cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> was similar to the control population </plain></SENT>
