<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the survival benefit of RIT compared with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An anastomosis was constructed in male Wag/Rij rats after intraluminal injection of CC531 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic efficacy of (177) Lu-labelled MG1 (single intravenous dose of 300 MBq/kg, n = 20) was compared with that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy (6 weekly cycles administered intraperitoneally, n = 20) and no treatment (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was monitored by bodyweight measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both chemotherapy and RIT affected bodyweight, but the weight of animals in the RIT group remained significantly higher than in the chemotherapy group (median slope of bodyweight plot 0·48 versus 0·30 g/day; P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that overall survival in the RIT and chemotherapy groups was significantly better than that in the control group (50 and 46 per cent versus 25 per cent respectively after 170 days; P = 0·024 and P = 0·029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival after treatment with RIT did not differ from that after chemotherapy (P = 0·911) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RIT is as effective as chemotherapy in experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
