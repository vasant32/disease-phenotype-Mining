<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stereotactic radiation therapy is an evolving modality to treat otherwise unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, two local therapies: 1) single session robotic radiosurgery (RRS) and 2) percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were compared in a total of 60 heavily pretreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with a total of 35 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> not qualifying for surgery that were treated in curative intent with RRS were prospectively followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To compare efficacy of both treatment modalities, patients treated with RFA during the same period of time were matched according to number and size of the treated lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> free survival (DFS), and freedom from distant recurrence (FFDR) were analyzed for efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related side effects were recorded for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median diameter of the treated lesions was 33 mm (7-53 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One- and two-year local control rates showed no significant difference but favored RRS (85% vs. 65% and 80% vs. 61%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A significantly longer local DFS of patients treated with RRS compared to RFA (34.4 months vs. 6.0 months; p &lt; 0.001) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both, median FFDR (11.4 months for RRS vs. 7.1 months for RFA p = 0.25) and the recurrence rate (67% for RRS and 63% for RFA, p &gt; 0.99) were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Single session RRS is a safe and effective method to treat colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, a trend towards longer DFS was seen in patients treated with RRS when compared to RFA </plain></SENT>
