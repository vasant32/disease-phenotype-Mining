<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In mammalian cells, POLQ (pol Î¸) is an unusual specialized DNA polymerase whose in vivo function is under active investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>POLQ has been implicated by different experiments to play a role in resistance to ionizing radiation and defense against genomic instability, in base excision repair, and in immunological diversification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protein is formed by an N-terminal helicase-like domain, a C-terminal DNA polymerase domain, and a large central domain that spans between the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This arrangement is also found in the Drosophila Mus308 protein, which functions in resistance to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homologs of POLQ and Mus308 are found in multicellular eukaryotes, including plants, but a comparison of phenotypes suggests that not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these genes are functional orthologs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flies defective in Mus308 are sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, while mammalian cells defective in POLQ are primarily sensitive to DNA double-strand breaking agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells from Polq(-/-) mice are hypersensitive to radiation and peripheral blood cells display increased spontaneous and ionizing radiation-induced levels of micronuclei (a hallmark of gross chromosomal aberrations), though mice apparently develop normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of POLQ in human and mouse cells causes sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other double strand breaking agents and increased DNA damage signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Retrospective studies of clinical samples show that higher levels of POLQ gene expression in breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are correlated with poorer outcomes for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A clear understanding of the mechanism of action and physiologic function of POLQ in the cell is likely to bear clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
