<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) has been a mainstay of chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but it is still unknown whether the combining of 5-FU with novel molecular-targeting agents is effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a direct target of 5-FU, and the low TS level has been generally supposed to sensitize 5-FU's efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that RB-reactivating agents could enhance the efficacy of 5-FU, because the RB-reactivating agents could suppress the function of transcription factor E2F of TS gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used three RB-reactivating agents, trametinib/GSK1120212 (MEK inhibitor), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> (PPARÎ± <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>), and LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), with 5-FU against human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> HT-29 and HCT15 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trametinib induced p15 and p27 expression and reduced cyclin D1 levels in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> also dephosphorlated ERK1/2 and reduced cyclin D1 levels in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LY294002 induced p27 expression in HCT15 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three agents caused dephosphorylation of RB protein and G1-phase arrest with a reduction of TS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the combination of 5-FU with each of the agents resulted in a significant decrease of colony numbers in HT-29 or HCT15 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest "RB-reactivation therapy" using molecular-targeting agents to be a new strategy for 5-FU-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In particular, we strongly expect trametinib, which was discovered in Japan and was recently submitted to FDA for approval, to be used together with established regimens for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
