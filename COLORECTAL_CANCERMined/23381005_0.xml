<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, actual population screening has, in many countries, halted at the level of individual testing and discussions on differences between screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a wealth of new evidence from various community-based studies looking at test uptake, screening-programme organization and the importance of quality assurance, population screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is now moving into a new realm, promising better results in terms of reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such a shift in the paradigm requires a change from opportunistic, individual testing towards organized population screening with comprehensive monitoring and full-programme quality assurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, a combination of factors--including test characteristics, uptake, screenee autonomy, costs and capacity--must be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, evidence from randomized trials comparing different tests must be supplemented by studies of acceptance and uptake to obtain the full picture of the effectiveness (in terms of morbidity, mortality and cost) the different strategies have </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this Review, we discuss a range of screening modalities and describe the factors to be considered to achieve a truly effective population <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programme </plain></SENT>
