<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The LGR5 is known as a Wnt signaling target gene, and its expression pattern is related with β-catenin mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> is a member of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and regulates metabolism, aging, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the intensity of growth factor signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, it acts as a negative or positive regulator of Wnt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> on Wnt signaling and its target gene LGR5 is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of ROS on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> cells were treated with exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>, after which cellular responses and the expression of LGR5 were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SNU-C2A cells, proliferation increased following treatment with 50-300 µM of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>, whereas cell viability significantly decreased after treatment with 600-900 µM of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase (HO)-1 and jun, which aid in the reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, were induced in the low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-treated SNU-C2A cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The LGR5 expression level was significantly increased following 50-300 µM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> treatment; in addition, β-catenin was increased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the increased β-catenin was detected not in the nucleus but in the cytoplasm, which means that β-catenin was stabilized in the cytoplasm and not translocated into the nucleus where it could function as a transcription factor for the expression of LGR5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no direct interaction between LGR5 and β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that LGR5 expression increased when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells were treated with a low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the LGR5 increase resulted via activation of the JNK signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The induction of LGR5 expression influenced cell proliferation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
