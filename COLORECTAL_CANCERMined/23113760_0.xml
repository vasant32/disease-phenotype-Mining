<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate further the relevance of RRM2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>), we correlated the expression of RRM2 with the clinical outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective outcome study was conducted on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> collected from the COH [(City of Hope) National Medical Center, 217 cases] and ZJU (Zhejiang University, 220 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IHC (immunohistochemistry) was employed to determine the protein expression level of RRM2, and quantitative real-time PCR was employed to validate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that the adjusted ORs (odds ratios) of RRM2-high for distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were 2.06 [95% CI (confidence interval), 1.01-4.30] and 5.89 (95% CI, 1.51-39.13) in the COH and ZJU sets respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier analysis displayed that high expression of RRM2 had a negative impact on the OS (overall survival) and PFS (progress-free survival) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in both sets significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate Cox analysis further demonstrated that HRs (hazard ratios) of RRM2-high for OS were 1.88 (95% CI, 1.03-3.36) and 2.06 (95% CI, 1.10-4.00) in the COH and ZJU sets respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis demonstrated that the HR of RRM2 dramatically increased to 12.22 (95% CI, 1.62-258.31) in the MMR (mismatch repair) gene-deficient subgroup in the COH set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, a real-time study demonstrated that down-regulation of RRM2 by siRNA (small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) could significantly and specifically reduce the cell growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> ability in HT-29 and HCT-8 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore RRM2 is an independent prognostic factor and predicts poor survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is also a potential predictor for identifying good responders to chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
