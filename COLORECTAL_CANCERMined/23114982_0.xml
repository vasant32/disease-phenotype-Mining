<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As yet, however, gene-environment (G × E) interactions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have been studied mostly for a small number of candidate genes only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the possible interaction, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> etiology, between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the one hand, and overweight, smoking and alcohol consumption on the other, at a genome-wide level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end, we adopted a two-tiered approach comprising a case-only screening stage I (314 cases) and a case-control validation stage II (259 cases, 1,002 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interactions with the smallest p value in stage I were verified in stage II using multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we specifically studied known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-associated SNPs for possible G × E interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon adjustment for sex and age, and after allowing for multiple testing, however, only a single SNP (rs1944511) was found to be involved in a statistically significant interaction, namely with overweight (multiplicity-corrected p = 0.042 in stage II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several other G × E interactions were nominally significant but failed correction for multiple testing, including a previously reported interaction between rs9929218 and alcohol consumption that also emerged in our candidate SNP study (nominal p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notably, none of the interactions identified in our genome-wide analysis was with a previously reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-associated SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study therefore highlights the potential of an "agnostic" genome-wide approach to G × E analysis </plain></SENT>
