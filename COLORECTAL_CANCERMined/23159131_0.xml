<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine whether data from observational studies supports the hypothesis of an increased risk of overall and site-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> among individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using exogenous insulin therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of nine key biomedical databases for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> years up to December 2011, restricted to the English language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from cohort and nested case-control studies were included in random effects meta-analyses of site-specific and overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence comparing ever use and new use of: (1) insulin to no insulin and; (2) insulin glargine to other insulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search yielded 3052 unique citations, of which 19 were selected for inclusion, representing data for 1,332,120 people and 41,947 cancers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>Pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> risk was increased among new users of insulin (RR: 3.18, 95%CI: 3.27-3.71, I(2)=32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New use of insulin glargine was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> (RR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.05-2.51, I(2)=0%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> (RR: 2.68, 95%CI: 1.50-4.79, I(2)=0%) but a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (RR: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.64-0.94, I(2)=15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: New use of insulin or insulin glargine was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, possibly due to reverse causality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New use of insulin glargine was associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> but an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results should be interpreted with caution due to limitations of included studies </plain></SENT>
