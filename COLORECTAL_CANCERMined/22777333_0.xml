<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized phase II trial of modified leucovorin, fluorouracil and irinotecan (mFOLFIRI) + bevacizumab and sequential IRIS + bevacizumab as first- or second-line therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were randomly assigned to receive mFOLFIRI + bevacizumab or sequential IRIS + bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg of bevacizumab and 150 mg/m(2) of irinitecan, and 80 mg/m(2)/day of S-1 orally from day 3 until day 16 as a 3-week course) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the safety of each method until week 12, with the secondary endpoint being the comparison of the safety and efficacy of the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The safety of the two treatments was comparable, except that G3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> and diarrhoea were less frequent with sequential IRIS + bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 62% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.1-79.8] versus 72% (95% CI 50.6-86.2), and progression-free survival was 324 days (95% CI 247-475) versus 345 days (95% CI 312-594) with mFOLFIRI + bevacizumab versus IRIS + bevacizumab, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sequential IRIS + bevacizumab is a safe and effective method of systemic chemotherapy against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and is compatible with mFOLFIRI + bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
