<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior meta-analyses did not distinguish between ET and EPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the relative risks (RR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> due to ET versus EPT among peri- or postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a total of 2,661 articles, four randomized controlled trials, eight cohort and eight case-control studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variables assessed included study characteristics, duration and recency of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use, method of assessment of HT use, outcome definition and its ascertainment method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RRs were synthesized by random-effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that EPT ever use was associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.68-0.81), and so was ET ever use (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While current use of ET was associated with a significantly reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85), former use was not (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.67-1.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recency did not significantly modify the association between EPT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EPT former use was associated with a lower RR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to ET former use (p = 0.008) but no such difference was observed between EPT and ET current use (p = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, we found consistent evidence supporting the association between EPT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk reduction, regardless of recency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While literature for the association between ET and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, our analyses suggest only current use of ET is associated with a decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
