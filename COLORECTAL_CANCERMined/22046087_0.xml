<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the expression and clinical significance of transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma (TIF1γ), Smad4 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβR) across a spectrum representing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue microarrays were prepared from archival paraffin embedded tissue, including 51 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 25 tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (TA) and 26 HPs, each with matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against TIF1γ, Smad4 and TGFβRII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of expression were scored semi-quantitatively (score 0-3 or loss and retention for Smad4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overexpression of TIF1γ was detected in 5/26 (19%) HP; however, it was seen in a significantly higher proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, 15/25 (60%) TAs and 24/51 (47%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa, HP, and TAs showed strong Smad4 expression, while its expression was absent in 22/51 (43%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of TGFβRII was more commonly seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, 13/25 (52%) TAs and 29/51 (57%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> compared to 9/26 (35%) HP (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a correlation between TIF1γ overexpression and Smad4 loss in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (Kendall tau rank correlation value = 0.35, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of TIF1γ overexpression were significantly higher in stage III than in stage I and II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that over-expression of TIF1γ occurs in early stages of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, is inversely related with Smad4 loss, and may be a prognostic indicator for poor outcome </plain></SENT>
