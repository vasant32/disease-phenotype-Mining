<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in the Taiwanese population with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to identify BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HRM analysis is a new gene scan tool that quickly performs the PCR and identifies sequence alterations without requiring post-PCR treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, DNAs were extracted from 182 cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples for clinical KRAS mutational analysis by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the samples were also tested for mutations within BRAF V600E and PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20) by HRM analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results were confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations is 1.1%, and 7.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, we found that nine patients (4.9%) with the KRAS mutation were coexistent with the PIK3CA mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients (2.2%) without the KRAS mutation were existent with the PIK3CA mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (1.1%) without the KRAS mutation were existent with the BRAF mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, we suppose that HRM analysis is rapid, feasible, and powerful diagnostic tool for the detection of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our results indicated the prevalence of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutational status in the Taiwanese population </plain></SENT>
