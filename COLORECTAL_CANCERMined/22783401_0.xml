<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is a key regulator of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, and consists of Aurora B kinase, INCENP, Survivin and Borealin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aurora B is a member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases, and Survivin belongs to the inhibitors of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (IAP) gene family, and is also a member of the CPC family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aurora B and Survivin have also been reported to be overexpressed in various human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; however, as yet no studies have investigated the co-expression of Survivin and Aurora B in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study, the correlation between Aurora B and Survivin expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry and the associated pathological features in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our present findings showed that nuclear Aurora B and cytoplasmic Survivin expression are strongly associated with and involved in lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that nuclear Aurora B and cytoplasmic Survivin are useful diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
