<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of present study are to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in the treatment of MCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a computerized search using combinations of the following keywords: "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>," "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Xeloda</z:chebi>," "chemotherapy," "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>," or "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>." RESULTS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> chemotherapy was associated with a significantly prolonged progression-free survival (WMD = 1.24; 95% CI, 0.04-2.44; P = 0.04), whereas overall survival was not statistically significant (WMD [random] = 0.29; P = 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> groups had equal 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.59-1.12, P = 0.21; OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.61-1.15, P = 0.27; OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.78-2.05, P = 0.34; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis also demonstrates that the response rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy was comparable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy (OR = 1.02, 95% CI, 0.90-1.14; P = 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When comparing single-agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin, our results showed an overall OR of 1.56 (95% CI, 1.16-2.09) in favor of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When toxicity was evaluated, a statistically significant benefit with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-based therapy was seen, especially for grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71-0.91; P = 0.00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy demonstrated a significantly superior progression-free survival, equivalent overall survival, and comparable response rate with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations support the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in the treatment of MCRC as a first-line or as a neoadjuvant modality </plain></SENT>
