<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Defects in DNA repair pathways have been linked with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant radiotherapy has become commonplace in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> however it is associated with a higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is known that radiation results in DNA damage directly or indirectly by radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) by causing double-strand breaks (DSBs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of work in RIBE has been performed in cell lines and limited studies have been in or ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The first study aim was to examine by immunohistochemistry, levels of DSB (expression of the protein MRE11) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic tissue outside the irradiated field post neo-adjuvant radiotherapy (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These levels were compared to (a) irradiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue post neo-adjuvant radiation within the same group, (b) a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient group (group 2) who had not undergone neo-adjuvant radiotherapy and (c) a non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patient group (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second aim was to determine if MRE11 expression levels were related to survival or radio-sensitivity post neo-adjuvant radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a highly significant increase in MRE 11 expression in group 1 versus groups 2 and 3 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between MRE11 levels and survival or radio-sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings show radiotherapy causes DSBs at significantly higher levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa of patients post neo-adjuvant treatment which may represent RIBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If this damage remains unrepaired, increased levels of genomic instability may contribute to the higher occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancers</z:e> in patients treated post neo-adjuvant radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
