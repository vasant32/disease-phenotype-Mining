<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) associated with MSI, an intermediate methylation subgroup is also a feature of non-MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> have no evidence of either MSI or CIN, here called Microsatellite and Chromosomal Stable (MACS), and require their methylation profile to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and molecular features of 170 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were investigated and stratified into MSI, CIN and MACS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MACS were most often found in the left colon and had a significantly lower BRAF mutation frequency (p &lt; 0.001) compared with MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MACS had better survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.244, p = 0.017] compared with CIN, but were similar to MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of 1,505 CpG loci from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes was analysed in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (n = 44 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> pairs) and compared with CIN, MSI and MACS status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using two-way hierarchical clustering, three subgroups were identified, which associated with CIN, MSI and MACS status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using significance analysis of microarray, 16 CpG loci demonstrating methylation changes associated with MACS were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A combination of six loci identified MACS with 81% sensitivity and 93% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This result now requires independent validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hypomethylation of a CpG locus within the sonic hedgehog (SHH) promoter correlated with increased gene expression and was associated significantly with MACS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we propose that MACS have distinct clinicopathological features and can be distinguished from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> by a specific set of methylation loci </plain></SENT>
