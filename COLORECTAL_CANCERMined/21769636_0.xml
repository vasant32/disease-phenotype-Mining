<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that bevacizumab discontinuation could lead to an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> flare and eventually to an accelerated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> has not been confirmed in a recent large pooled analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore the optimal duration of bevacizumab still remains undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: PFS and OS were retrospectively analyzed in patients with previously untreated mCRC who received bevacizumab 5 mg/Kg and standard FOLFIRI regimen (leucovorin, infusional fluorouracil and irinotecan) up to a maximum of 12 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 209 patients were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five (26.3%) patients received at least 6 administrations and 114 (54.5%) received a maximum of 12 administrations of bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median exposure to bevacizumab was 148 days (4.9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median PFS and OS were 10.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.2-12.2 months] and 31.6 months (95% CI 25.8-37.3 months), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall objective response rate was 49.8% (95% CI 42.9-56.6) and the disease control rate 81.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately 65% and 30% of patients received some form of second- and third-line therapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The toxicity profile of bevacizumab was consistent with that documented in previous trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis remarkably long PFS and OS were obtained with a first-line therapy duration limited to a maximum of 12 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data does not support a decreased PFS or increased mortality after discontinuation of bevacizumab in mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
