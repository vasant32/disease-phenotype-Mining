<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Clinical data from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who underwent surgical resections from 1994 to 2004 was analyzed retrospectively using the documented records and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017185" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal tumor</z:e> databases at the gastrointestinal institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate the association between clinical variables and overall survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A consecutive series of 1.294 CRC patients were enrolled for the final analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The five-year survival rates were 94.1%, 80.2%, 61.7% and 23.2% of patients with stage from I to IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seven patients (8.3%) had disease recurrence during the follow-up with a median of 50.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After radical surgical resections, patients with recurrence could still expect a five-year survival rate of 44.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that patient age &gt;60 years, infiltrative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo>, poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, disease recurrence and late TNM stage were associated with poor survival (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall postoperative survival in this series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was mainly affected by patient age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e>, histological grade, TNM stage and disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For those patients with recurrence, surgical resection should be recommended primarily if the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is resectable </plain></SENT>
