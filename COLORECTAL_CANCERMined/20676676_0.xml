<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and quality of life of a short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (XELOX) followed by single-agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> in patients with previously untreated, inoperable, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 130 mg/m(2) on d1 plus oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily (bid) on d1-14 every 21 days for four cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients achieving stable disease (SD) or better than received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1,250 mg/m(2) bid on d1-14 every 21 days until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 21/45 (47%) of patients responded to the initial XELOX chemotherapy whilst SD or better was documented in 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 6.7 (95% CI 5.7-9.6) months, and median overall survival (OS) was 20.5 (95% CI 13.1-28.1) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 34 patients who then received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> maintenance therapy, the median PFS was 8.1 (95% CI 6.2-11.8) months and median OS was 23.1 (95% CI 17.8-28.5) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A marked reduction in the vast majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades of adverse event occurred on switching from initial XELOX to maintenance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> chemotherapy including grades 1-2 (77 vs. 47%) and grade 3 (7 vs. 3%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, diarrhoea and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-course XELOX followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> maintenance therapy provides an active and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A median OS of more than 20 months is promising and by limiting the number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> infusions, this approach minimises the risk of unwanted cumulative neurotoxicity, is cheaper and more convenient for both patients and healthcare providers </plain></SENT>
