<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The microenvironment of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> can influence both the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the behavior of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells which, in turn, can rapidly adapt to environmental changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence points to the involvement of amoeboid cell migration and thus of cell blebbing in the metastatic process; however, the cues that promote amoeboid cell behavior in physiological and pathological conditions have not yet been clearly identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is found in high amount in the microenvironment of aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and is considered as an independent marker of bad prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show by immunoblotting, activity assay and immunofluorescence that, in SW620 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, matrix-associated PAI-1 plays a role in the cell behavior needed for amoeboid migration by maintaining cell blebbing, localizing PDK1 and ROCK1 at the cell membrane and maintaining the RhoA/ROCK1/MLC-P pathway activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained by modeling PAI-1 deposition around <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> indicate that matrix-bound PAI-1 is heterogeneously distributed at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> periphery and that, at certain spots, the elevated concentrations of matrix-bound PAI-1 needed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells to undergo the mesenchymal-amoeboid transition can be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Matrix-bound PAI-1, as a matricellular protein, could thus represent one of the physiopathological requirements to support metastatic formation </plain></SENT>
