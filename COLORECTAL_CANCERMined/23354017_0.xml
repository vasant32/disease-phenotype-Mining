<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some patients with these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> have not been found to have pathogenic germline mutations and are considered to have Lynch-like syndrome (LLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in families of patients with LLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a population-based cohort of 1705 consecutive patients, performing MSI tests and immunohistochemical analyses of MMR proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> when they were found to have pathogenic germline mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with MSI and loss of MSH2 and/or MSH6 expression, isolated loss of PMS2 or loss of MLH1 without MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, and no pathogenic mutation were considered to have LLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics of patients and the age- and sex-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in families were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was significantly lower in families of patients with LLS than in families with confirmed cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> (SIR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, 6.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.58-9.54; SIR for LLS, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.16-3.56; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was higher in families of patients with LLS than in families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (SIR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.79; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in families with LLS is lower that of families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> but higher than that of families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the need for special screening and surveillance strategies for these patients and their relatives </plain></SENT>
