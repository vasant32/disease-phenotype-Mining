<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although epidemiologic studies suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, its effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database (1998-2006) to conduct a retrospective cohort study of 36,079 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> to determine the independent effect of MetS and its components on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free rates (RFRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on MetS and its components were ascertained from Medicare claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OS and RFRs in patients with and without MetS and its components were compared using multivariate Cox models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MetS had no apparent effect on OS or RFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) and elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were associated with worse OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.17 [95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.21] and 1.08 [95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.12], respectively) and worse RFRs (aHR, 1.25 [95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.34] and 1.22 [95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.33], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> was associated with improved survival (aHR, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.80) and reduced recurrence (aHR, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects were consistent for both men and women and were more pronounced in patients with early stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MetS had no apparent effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> outcomes, probably because of the combined adverse effects of elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/DM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and the protective effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> in patients with nonmetastatic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that patients who have early stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> with elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/DM and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may benefit from more intensive surveillance and/or broader use of adjuvant therapy and that trials to define the benefits of low-fat diets, insulin-lowering agents, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on recurrence/survival in patients with nonmetastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> are warranted </plain></SENT>
