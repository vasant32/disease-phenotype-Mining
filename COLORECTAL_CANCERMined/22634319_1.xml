<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This first-in-human phase I clinical trial aimed to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and appropriate dose for phase II studies; characterize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters; and assess antitumor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bardoxolone <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> was administered orally once daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An accelerated titration design was employed until a grade 2-related adverse event occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation was then employed until the MTD was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single dose and steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of the drug were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assessment of Nrf2 activation was examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by measuring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> oxidoreductase (NQO1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical assessment of markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, cell cycle, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was carried out on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The DLTs were grade 3 reversible liver transaminase elevations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MTD was established as 900 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response occurred in a mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient, and a partial response was observed in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011779'>anaplastic thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NQO1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels increased in PBMCs, and NF-κB and cyclin D1 levels decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bardoxolone <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> was well tolerated with an MTD of 900 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The increase in eGFR suggests that bardoxolone <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> might be beneficial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses and pharmacodynamic effects were observed, supporting continued development of other synthetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36615">triterpenoids</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
