<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, however, the study of this subject has been very limited and results are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the relationship between KRAS mutations and NF-κB activation and their effect on chemotherapy response and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: NF-κB activation was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 167 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens in which the KRAS mutation status was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and pathologic data were extracted from the medical records and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 167 tumors screened, 63 (37.7 %) had NF-κB activation, 59 (35.3 %) had KRAS mutations, and 30 (18.0 %) had both NF-κB activation and KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of NF-κB activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with KRAS mutations was significantly higher than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> KRAS; 50.8 versus 30.6 %, P = 0.012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with both KRAS mutations and NF-κB activation had a lower objective response to first-line chemotherapy than patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 23.8 versus 49.4 % (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with both KRAS mutations and NF-κB activation, overall survival of patients in other groups was significantly higher; median overall survival was 28.4 months (95 % CI 21.0-35.8) versus 46.3 months (95 % CI 39.4-53.2), hazard ratio 0.259 (95 % CI 0.125-0.538), P = 0.005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NF-κB activation was associated with KRAS mutation, and both KRAS mutation and NF-κB activation were indicative of high tolerance of chemotherapy and poor prognosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> with KRAS mutations and NF-κB activation may be a unique subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
