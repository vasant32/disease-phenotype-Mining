<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We have monitored the perioperative changes of plasmatic values of plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 (PAI-1) in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients depending on the stage of disease and the use of prophylactic low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred 100 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients (64 men and 36 women) with average age of 60, in two randomized groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were surgically treated using the same technique and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hours before the surgery, the first group (48 patients) received LMWH-nadroparin calcium in doses of 0.3 or 0.4 mL sc, while the second group (52 patients) received it eight hours after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the surgery, Nadroparin calcium was administered daily using the same dose as before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected: before the surgery, 10 minutes after the first surgical incision, 8 hours after the surgery, and on the 3rd, 5th and 10 th postoperative days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The staging of the disease (according to the Dukes classification) was compared with the patients' blood plasma concentration of PAI-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis using the c2 test, the <z:chebi fb="162" ids="6605">LSD</z:chebi> test, Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney test was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was patohistologicaly confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 100 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the Dukes classification, 6 patients had stage A, 51 had stage B, and 43 had stage C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 measurements showed that baseline measurements were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> boundaries for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes after the first incision a sharp decline of PAI-1 values in the plasma of both patient groups was observed, which could be explained by the use due to the effect on t-PA secreted from the damaged endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 values in both groups of subjects have returned to starting (baseline) values, and remained within these values through the third, fourth and fifth measurement in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the two randomized groups which leads to the conclusion that the application of LMWH does not affect PAI-1 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference of the tested parameters according to the Dukes classification was obtained only for parameter PAI-1 for pairs Dukes A:B as well as Dukes A:C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant correlation was found for plasma values of fibrinolysis inhibitor PAI-1 according to the Dukes classification, but it does not correlate to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion through intestinal wall structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The reason for the statistically significant increase of PAI-1 values in the Dukes A stage remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: By activating t-PA and blocking PAI-1, Nadroparin calcium perioperatively makes the haemostasis system stable and balanced </plain></SENT>
