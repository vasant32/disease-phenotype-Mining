<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Data from patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before resection were reviewed and evaluated to see whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy influences the predictive outcome of R1 resections (margin is 0 mm) in patients with CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2000 and December 2008, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients undergoing liver resection for CRLM were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into those who did and did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome after R0 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free margin &gt;0 mm) and R1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free margin 0 mm) resection was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 264 were eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients without chemotherapy showed a significant difference in median disease-free survival (DFS) after R0 or R1 resection: 17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 10-24] months versus 8 (95% CI 4-12) months (P &lt; 0.001), whereas in patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy the difference in DFS between R0 and R1 resection was not significant: 18 (95% CI 10-26) months versus 9 (95% CI 0-20) months (P = 0.303) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients without chemotherapy showed a significant difference in median overall survival (OS) after R0 or R1 resection: 53 (95% CI 40-66) months versus 30 (95% CI 13-47) months (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the median OS showed no significant difference: 65 (95% CI 39-92) months for the R0 group versus the R1 group, in whom the median OS was not reached (P = 0.645) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, R1 resection was of no predictive value for DFS and OS </plain></SENT>
