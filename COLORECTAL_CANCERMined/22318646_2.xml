<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent elective resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (open resection, n = 1,197; laparoscopic resection, n = 814) from January 2000 to December 2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The operative details, postoperative complications, postoperative outcomes, and survival data were collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made between patients who had laparoscopic and open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age, gender, medical morbidity, and American Society of Anesthesiologists status were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic resection was associated with significantly less blood loss and a shorter hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operating mortality and morbidity were significantly lower in the laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The qualities of the specimens in terms of the distal resection margin and the number of lymph nodes examined were not inferior in the laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the median follow-up of 40.3 months, the 5-year overall survival (74.1% vs. 65.5%, p &lt; 0.001) and disease specific survival (81.9% vs. 75.2%, p = 0.002) were significantly better in patients with non-disseminated disease in the laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operative approach was an independent prognostic factor in the overall (risk ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.093-1.700, p = 0.006) and disease specific (risk ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.005-1.738, p = 0.048) survivals in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is associated with more favorable overall and disease specific survivals when compared with open resection in a high volume tertiary center </plain></SENT>
