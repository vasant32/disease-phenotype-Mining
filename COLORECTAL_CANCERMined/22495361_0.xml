<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Families with germ line mutations in 1 of 6 mismatch repair genes are known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The largest number of mutations has been detected in the mismatch repair genes MLH1 and MSH2, but several mutations in MSH6 have also been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: : Whether HNPCC families are screened for mutations in mismatch repair genes often relies on their immunohistochemical profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate this approach in Lynch families carrying mutations in MSH6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Results of the screening of the MSH6 gene in HNPCC families were compared with those obtained on immunohistochemical protein analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 56 (7%) of 815 families, at least 1 MSH6 mutation, 23 definitively pathogenic mutations and 38 missense mutations or unclassified variants, and several polymorphisms in the MSH6 gene were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In families carrying a pathogenic MSH6 mutation, 69.6% of 23 <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinomas</z:mp> showed absence of pMSH6 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 34.5%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proteins could be detected, whereas in 34.5% pMSH6 was present and pMLH1/pPMS2 was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: If genetic screening of HNPCC families depended on immunohistochemical results, a substantial number of families harboring a pathogenic mutation in MSH6 and the vast majority of families harboring an MSH6 unclassified variant would not be detected </plain></SENT>
