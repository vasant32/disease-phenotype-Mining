<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (age ≥70) who were treated with curative operation were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared 57 patients whose survival time was less than 2 years with 117 patients with survival time exceeding 5 years, based on the clinical, pathologic, and preoperative clinical laboratory analysis findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A risk scoring system on basis of factors determined by multiple logistic regression analysis was explored and validated by both receiver operating characteristic and survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Neuroticism</z:e>, rural residence, deep layer invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and high serum CEA levels were found to be associated with adverse prognosis in the multivariate logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk scoring system based on these factors showed that the patients with total score exceeding 2.5 had a significantly poorer prognosis (P &lt; 0.05), which was validated by survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neuroticism</z:e>, rural residence, deep layer invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and high serum CEA level should be regarded as a high-risk group; a simple scoring system based on these factors could be used to evaluate the risk and facilitate treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for elderly patients </plain></SENT>
