<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 140 patients with operable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to preoperative PLR, the patients were divided into low PLR group (PLR&lt;250) and high PLR group (PLRâ‰¥250) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival rates and the clinicopathological factors in the two groups were analyzed using univariate analysis and COX regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients with a high PLR had a significantly lower overall 5-year survival rate than those with a low PLR (71.4% vs 51.5%, P=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion, lymph nodes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TMN</z:e> stage, and PLR as significant risk factors for reduced overall 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In COX regression model, a high PLR was identified as an independent risk factor for poorer prognosis in patients with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (RR: 2.213; 95%CI: 1.007-4.863, P=0.0048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preoperative PLR can be a clinically significant factor for assessment of prognosis of resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
