<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to search for individual characteristics and clinical aspects associated with successful psychosocial adjustment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) undergoing (CT) chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Seventy-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated with CT or CRT in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale Self-Reporting (PAIS-SR) questionnaire was used as a measurement of psychosocial adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Psychosocial adaptation was successful in 18 patients (24%) and unsuccessful in 57 patients (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Young patients, married patients and males showed lower psychosocial adaptation to disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is associated with the decrease in sexual relations, economic resources and psychological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients complained that they were unsatisfied due to the lack of disease and treatment information offered by the heath care team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: In the process of adaptation, clinical features such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location and treatment scheme are considered basic, as well as age, education, marital status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Areas such as sexuality, interpersonal and family relationships, economic status and emotional state of patients affected by the disease and treatments provide a deep complexity in the study of the psychosocial adaptation process in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
