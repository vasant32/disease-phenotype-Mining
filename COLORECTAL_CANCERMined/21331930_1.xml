<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of patients with known or suspected recurrent colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is now an accepted indication for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PET and CT are complimentary, and therefore, integrated PET/CT imaging should be performed where available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET/CT is indicated as the initial test for diagnosis and staging of recurrence, and for preoperative staging (N and M) of known recurrence that is considered to be resectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET imaging is valuable for the differentiation of posttreatment changes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumor</z:e>, differentiation of benign from malignant lesions (indeterminate lymph nodes, hepatic, and pulmonary lesions), and the evaluation of patients with rising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers in the absence of a known source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The addition of FDG-PET/CT to the evaluation of these patients reduces overall treatment costs by accurately identifying patients who will and will not benefit from surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This new powerful technology provides more accurate interpretation of both CT and FDG-PET images and therefore more optimal patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PET/CT fusion images affect the clinical management by guiding further procedures (biopsy, surgery, and radiation therapy), excluding the need for additional procedures, and changing both inter- and intramodality therapy </plain></SENT>
