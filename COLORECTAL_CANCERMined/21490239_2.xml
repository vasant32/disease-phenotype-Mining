<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the effect modification of MHT-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in postmenopausal women by 47 polymorphisms with known or putative functional relevance in 16 candidate genes related to hormone metabolism (COMT, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP17A1, GSTP, and HSD17B1), transport (ABCB1), and signaling (ESR1, ESR2, SHBG, PGR, and NR1I2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 685 CRC patients and 684 healthy controls from a German population-based case-control study (DACHS) were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiplicative statistical interaction between polymorphisms and ever MHT use as well as duration of use was assessed using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk associated with ever MHT use as well as with duration was significantly modified by rs1202168 in the transporter gene ABCB1 (P interaction=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MHT-associated risk reduction was not significant in homozygous non-carriers (odds ratio (OR) ever use=0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.34; OR per 5 year duration=0.94, 95% CI 0.83-1.08), while homozygous carriers of the minor T allele had a 57% lower risk with ever use of MHT (95% CI 0.21-0.88) and a 22% lower risk per 5 years of MHT use (95% CI 0.62-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant effect modification was also observed for the ESR1_rs910416 polymorphism (P interaction=0.03 for ever use and 0.07 for duration of use), whereby the decreased risk was attenuated in homozygous carriers of the minor C allele (OR ever use=0.87, 95% CI 0.48-1.60, OR per 5 year duration=0.99, 95% CI 0.83-1.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of this exploratory study provide first evidence that polymorphisms in genes related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> transport and signaling may modify MHT-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk but warrant replication in an independent population </plain></SENT>
