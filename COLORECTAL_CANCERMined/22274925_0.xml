<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the mechanisms involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced silencing of RUNX3 in terms of epigenetic alteration since the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene transcription are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RUNX3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions were down-regulated in response to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>) in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line SNU-407 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This down-regulation was abolished with pretreatment of the ROS scavenger, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, methylation-specific PCR data revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> treatment increased RUNX3 promoter methylation; however, NAC and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), decreased it, suggesting that an epigenetic regulatory mechanism by ROS-induced methylation may be involved in RUNX3 silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> treatment resulted in DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) up-regulation with increased expression and activity, increased binding of DNMT1 to HADC1, and increased DNMT1 binding to the RUNX3 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 5-Aza-dC treatment prevented the decrease in RUNX3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> treatment inhibited the nuclear localization and expression of RUNX3, which was abolished by NAC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the down-regulation of RUNX3 expression by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> also influenced cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the data suggested that ROS silenced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor, RUNX3, by epigenetic regulation and may therefore be associated with the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
