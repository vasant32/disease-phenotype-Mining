<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genetic variant in the gene encoding the selenoprotein <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase 4 (GPX4) has been reported to influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study GPX4 expression was knocked down by 60% using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> silencing and the effects were investigated using an unbiased transcriptomic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis of the total Caco-2 cell transcriptome was carried out using Illumina HumanHT-12v3 beadchips and the data were validated by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that the major canonical pathways affected by GPX4 knockdown were oxidative phosphorylation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16389">ubiquinone</z:chebi> biosynthesis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and the top two toxicological lists were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and real-time PCR confirmed that knockdown affected target genes encoding components of respiratory complexes I, IV, and V as well as the protein <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor (AIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GPX4 knockdown increased levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> reactive oxygen species and oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time-course experiments showed that changes in AIF expression preceded those in the respiratory complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in Caco-2 gut epithelial cells GPx4, through effects on AIF, plays a major role in maintaining the oxidative phosphorylation system and protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
