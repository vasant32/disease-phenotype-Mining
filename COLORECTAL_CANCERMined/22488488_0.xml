<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To quantify the extent to which a clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> mortality reduction due to screening could have been masked by control arm screening (contamination) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used three independently developed models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> natural history to conduct a virtual PLCO trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simulated participants underwent pre-trial screening based on population patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention arm followed observed compliance during the trial then resumed population screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A contaminated control arm followed observed contamination during the trial then resumed population screening, while an uncontaminated control arm discontinued screening upon entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assumed a clinically significant screening benefit, applied population treatments and survival patterns, and calculated mortality rate ratios relative to the contaminated and uncontaminated control arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The virtual trial reproduced observed incidence, including stage and grade distributions, and control arm mortality after 10 years of complete follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under the assumed screening benefit, the three models found that contamination increased the mortality rate ratio from 0.68-0.77 to 0.86-0.91, increased the chance of excess mortality in the intervention arm from 0-4 % to 15-28 %, and decreased the power of the trial to detect a mortality difference from 40-70 % to 9-25 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our computer simulation models indicate that contamination substantially limited the ability of the PLCO to identify a clinically significant screening benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While the trial shows annual screening does not reduce mortality relative to population screening, contamination prevents concluding whether screening reduces mortality relative to no screening </plain></SENT>
