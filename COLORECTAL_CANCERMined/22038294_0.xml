<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for early recurrence in patients who had undergone curative resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) and to evaluate the outcome after recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 119 patients were divided into 2 groups: an early recurrence group (n = 54) who had recurrence within 2 years of curative resection of CRLM and a 2-year recurrence-free group (n = 65) who remained disease-free for at least 2 years following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the initial 5-year period after surgery, 4 out of 65 patients (6%) in the 2-year recurrence-free group and 29 out of 54 patients (54%) in the early recurrence group died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that postoperative morbidity was an independent predictor of early recurrence after curative resection of CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early recurrence is the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 5 years after curative resection of CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative morbidity increases the risk of early recurrence in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reduction in perioperative morbidity may, therefore, improve the outcome of curative resection, as well as reducing medical costs </plain></SENT>
