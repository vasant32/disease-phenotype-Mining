<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the characteristics of people who have never been screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we use the health belief model to examine the constructs associated with screening behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used data from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to create three study outcomes: people who have been screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and are up-to-date with current recommendations, people who have been screened but are not up-to-date, and people who have never been screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used multivariate logistic regression modeling to calculate predicted marginal estimates examining the associations between the screening outcomes and demographic and Health Belief Model (HBM) characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall 29% of respondents had never been screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the adjusted model, 36.6% of US adults age 50-59 years and 29.1% of US men reported never being screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found statistically significant differences among screening outcomes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demographics and HBM constructs except could not see a doctor because of costs in the last 12 months, where approximately 29% reported no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>New interventions should focus on those subpopulations that have never been screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
