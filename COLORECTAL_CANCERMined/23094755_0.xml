<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten years ago, few if any researchers in Asia showed interest in nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Today, NAFLD is increasingly recognized as a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> not only in Western countries but also in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its importance is exemplified by its high prevalence, disease progression, and association with major medical disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Asia, 15-30% of the general adult population suffers from NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, the reported prevalence is typically over 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with the active form of NAFLD, namely steatohepatitis (NASH), may have <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> progression and eventually develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with NASH-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> have similar mortality to those with other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, and they have a high risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> up to 2-3% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, NAFLD patients have a high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One major challenge for practicing clinicians is how to identify patients with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> among many who are found to have NAFLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While liver biopsy is traditionally considered the gold standard for disease staging, it is invasive and unpleasant, and is an impractical tool for a disease that affects a quarter of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To this end, new developments in transient elastography and biomarkers such as cytokeratin-18 fragments can help exclude significant <z:mp ids='MP_0003333'>liver fibrosis</z:mp> and NASH, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This article summarizes a young researcher's journey through this exciting area of research and what he has learned from amazing people <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> around the world </plain></SENT>
