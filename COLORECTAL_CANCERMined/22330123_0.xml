<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon is the most common histopathological type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Western Europe and the United States, it is the third most common type and accounts for 98% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CRC">cancers of the large intestine</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Uganda, as elsewhere in Africa, the majority of patients are elderly (at least 60 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, more recently, it has been observed that younger patients (less than 40 years of age) are presenting with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is also an increase in its incidence and most patients present late, possibly because of the lack of a comprehensive national screening and preventive health-care program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinicopathological features of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the case of a young man in Kampala, Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man from Kampala, Uganda, presented with gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distension</z:hpo>, progressive loss of weight, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was initially screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus/acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a battery of tests, a diagnosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was finally established with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining of a cell block made from the sediment of a liter of cytospun ascitic fluid, which showed atypical glands floating in abundant extracellular mucin, suggestive of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ancillary tests with alcian blue/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi> Schiff and mucicarmine staining revealed that it was a mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed strong positivity with CDX2, confirming that the origin of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> has been noted to occur with increasing frequency in young adults in Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients have mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, present late, and have rapid disease progression and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> should no longer be excluded from consideration only on the basis of a patient's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A high index of suspicion is important in the diagnosis of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in young African patients </plain></SENT>
