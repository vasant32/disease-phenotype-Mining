<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) poison is frequently included in the treatment regimens for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no predictive biomarkers for Top1 poisons are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here report a study on the TOP1 gene copy number in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and its association with patient prognosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The study included TOP1 and CEN-20 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from 154 stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> chemonaïve patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of aberration in the TOP1 gene copy number, the CEN-20 copy number and the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio were analyzed and associated with overall survival (OS), time to recurrence (TTR) and in a subgroup analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients only with time to local recurrence (LR in RC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the TOP1 and CEN-20 copy numbers were correlated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> Ki67 proliferation index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 35.7% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had an increased TOP1 copy number above 4n gene copies per cell and 28.6% and 9.7% had a TOP1/CEN-20 ratio ≥1.5 or ≥2.0, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TOP1 copy number and the TOP1/CEN-20 ratios were separately added into multivariate analyses as continuous variables, in which also age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> location and Ki67 status were added as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio, the TOP1 copy number was significantly associated with OS (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42-0.90; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither the TOP1 copy number nor the ratio was significantly associated with TTR and only the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio was significantly associated with LR in RC (HR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.08-0.83; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between the TOP1 copy number and proliferation, while a weak and inverse correlation between the CEN-20 copy number and proliferation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that increased TOP1 gene copy numbers are frequent findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> but unrelated to the proliferative status of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association with prognosis is important to consider when planning and analyzing future studies investigating TOP1 as a potential predictive biomarker for Top1 poisons </plain></SENT>
