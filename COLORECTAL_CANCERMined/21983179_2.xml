<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A considerable percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> are resistant to standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because patients with a priori-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> do not benefit from multimodal treatment, understanding and overcoming this resistance remains of utmost clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently reported overexpression of the Wnt transcription factor TCF4, also known as TCF7L2, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> that were resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because Wnt signaling has not been associated with treatment response, we aimed to investigate whether TCF4 mediates chemoradioresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference-mediated silencing of TCF4 was employed in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines, and sensitivity to (chemo-) radiotherapy was assessed using a standard colony formation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Silencing of TCF4 caused a significant sensitization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells to clinically relevant doses of X-rays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was restricted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with high T cell factor (TCF) reporter activity, presumably in a β-catenin-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiosensitization was the consequence of (i) a transcriptional deregulation of Wnt/TCF4 target genes, (ii) a silencing-induced G(2)/M phase arrest, (iii) an impaired ability to adequately halt cell cycle progression after radiation and (iv) a compromised DNA double strand break repair as assessed by γH2AX staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results indicate a novel mechanism through which the Wnt transcription factor TCF4 mediates chemoradioresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they suggest that TCF4 is a promising molecular target to sensitize resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to (chemo-) radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
