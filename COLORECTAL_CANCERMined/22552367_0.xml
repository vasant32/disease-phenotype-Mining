<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858970" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenicity</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used azoxymethane/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (AOM/DSS)-induced mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> model to investigate their <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that exposure to As(III) or Cr(VI), alone or in combination, together with AOM/DSS pretreatment has a promotion effect, increasing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> incidence, multiplicity, size, and grade, as well as cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry revealed that As(III) or Cr(VI) treatment alone significantly changed the density of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of β-catenin and phospho-GSK was increased by treatment of carcinogenic metals alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, the expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase1 (NOX1) and the level of 8-OHdG were also increased by treatment of carcinogenic metals alone </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in an in vitro system, exposure of CRL-1807 to carcinogenic metals increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, the expression of β-catenin, phospho-GSK, and NOX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of ROS generation by addition of SOD or catalase inhibited β-catenin expression and activity </plain></SENT>
