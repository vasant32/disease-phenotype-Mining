<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of both variants in Swedish cases and controls was similar to those previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that previously unknown sequence variations at the position of amino acid 423 (R423Q, R423P, and R423R) appear to occur more frequently in cases than in controls (p = 0.02), a finding that warrants future studies </plain></SENT>
