<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 16% relative risk reduction (RRR) of mortality was found in a meta-analysis based on four randomized controlled trials (RCT) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper was to scrutinize these trials for potential biases and assess their influence on the screening trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods  The four RCTs were reviewed based on the principles of 'Critical Appraisal of the Medical Literature' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Principal investigators of the four RCTs were contacted to clarify uncertainties in their study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from The Danish Data Archives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Authors of the Cochrane review were contacted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results  Six biases were identified, of which five favour screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of the biases identified were specific to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening: type of diagnostic method, place of surgery and diagnostic delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion  The 16% RRR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality found in the updated Cochrane review's meta-analysis is overestimated </plain></SENT>
