<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since dietary factors have been connected to a reduced risk of a diversity of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, in this study we investigated the effects of tomato powder (TP) on the development of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Wistar rats, and possible mechanism(s) by which TP shows its chemopreventive activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that TP added to feed at 5% rate decreases the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) and reduces the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and growth of AOM-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate that TP supplementation shows its chemopreventive activities through inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression via NF-ÎºB pathway and promotion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as well as regulating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in colorectal tissue of AOM-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings identify an intimate connection between dietary supplementation of TP and the decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in rats, and suggest that consumption of TP would be a natural candidate for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in men </plain></SENT>
