<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Errors in surgical pathology are partly due to the increasing workload of pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To reduce this workload, 'pathologists' assistants' (PAs) have been trained to take over some of the pathologists' recurrent tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of these tasks is the precise examination of ≥10 lymph nodes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e>), which is of paramount importance to reduce the risk of understaging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the role of PAs in harvesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> in colorectal resection specimens and, by doing so, in improving patient safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> harvest was retrospectively reviewed in 557 pathology reports on colorectal resection specimens collected in two Dutch hospitals from 2008 until 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PAs sampled ≥10 LNs in significantly more cases than pathologists did (83.2% vs 60.9% in hospital A and 79.2% vs 67.6% in hospital B) and recovered on average significantly more <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> than pathologists did (18.5 vs 12.2 in hospital A and 16.6 vs 13.2 in hospital B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PAs harvested a significantly higher percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> &lt;5 mm than pathologists did (64.2% vs 53.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy due to inadequate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> sampling alone were significantly higher for cases dissected by pathologists than for those dissected by PAs (17.3% vs 1.1% in hospital A and 13.1% vs 3.4% in hospital B) CONCLUSIONS: PAs contribute to patient safety since they recover more and, in particular, smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> from colorectal resection specimens than pathologists do </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they help to reduce costs and morbidity by reducing the number of patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy due to inadequate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> sampling alone </plain></SENT>
