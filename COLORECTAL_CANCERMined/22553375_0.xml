<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Dysregulation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) and Src signaling pathways commonly occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the PIK3CA gene are associated with an increase in severity of disease and worse clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of Src have been identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> and are suggested to play a central role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because these pathways appear to enhance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, molecularly targeted agents for both pathways are currently being evaluated in early-phase clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines and a patient-derived explant model to investigate the efficacy of saracatinib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the PIK3CA were evaluated to examine the association between mutations in the PIK3CA gene and sensitivity to saracatinib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have identified a subset of patients with a PIK3CA (exon 9 and 20) mutation with increased sensitivity to saracatinib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) mutation was also shown to be associated with increased sensitivity to saracatinib and have a reduced affinity for miR-520a and miR-525a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we show that Src inhibition reduces the interaction between Src and p85, subsequently decreasing Akt-dependent signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that a personalized approach in targeting Src in PIK3CA-mutant patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> may prove effective in a subset of patients with this genetic alteration </plain></SENT>
