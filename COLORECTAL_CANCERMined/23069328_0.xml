<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The native Australian bush fruit Illawarra plum (Podocarpus elatus Endl., Podocarpaceae) has a high content of anthocyanin-rich phenolics, with an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity at levels higher than most fruits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the molecular mechanisms of the anti-proliferative activity of Illawarra plum on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-tumorigenic young adult mouse colonic (YAMC) cells and tumorigenic human colonic (HT-29) cells were treated with a polyphenolic-rich Illawarra plum extract (0-1000 μg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Illawarra plum had anti-proliferative properties in only the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, with growth suppressed in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of HT-29 cells with Illawarra plum extract (500 μg/ml; 24 h) was also associated with a 2-fold increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and a cell cycle delay in the S phase (P &lt; 0·01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assessment of biomarkers for DNA damage revealed that plum treatment caused a 93 % down-regulation of telomerase activity (P &lt; 0·001) and a decrease in telomere length (up to 75 %; P &lt; 0·01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Illawarra plum extract also induced morphological alterations to HT-29 cells that were suggestive of induction of autophagy, as the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles was observed in many cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This could be induced by the increased (6-fold) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) activity (P &lt; 0·001) and the trend for increased expression of the class III HDAC sirtuin 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study has shown that Illawarra plum extract is able to reduce the proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells by altering the cell cycle, increasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and possibly inducing autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The active ingredients in Illawarra plum may provide an alternative chemoprevention strategy to conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
