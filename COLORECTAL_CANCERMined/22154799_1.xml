<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A well-characterized proteome resource holds special promise for the discovery of novel biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, quantification of the differences between physiological conditions together with deep down profiling has become increasingly challenging in proteomics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we perform expression profiling of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) proteome by stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis included performing mTRAQ and cICAT labeling in a pooled sample of three microsatellite stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and a pooled sample of their matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified and quantified a total of 3688 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, 1487 proteins were expressed differentially between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues by higher than 2-fold; 1009 proteins showed increased expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue, whereas 478 proteins showed decreased expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic analysis revealed that our data were largely consistent with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> relevant signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/Î²-catenin, caveolar-mediated endocytosis, and RAN signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, known as the Waburg hypothesis, was also confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our data showing alterations in the proteomic profile of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> constitutes a useful resource that may provide insights into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> with later goal of identifying biologically and clinically relevant marker proteins </plain></SENT>
