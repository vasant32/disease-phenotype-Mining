<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Methods for predicting individual responsiveness to targeted chemotherapy are urgently needed, considering the frequent resistance and extremely high cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A chemosensitive single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery schema is presented that utilizes (i) genome-wide SNP screening with a human SNP array and an in vitro chemosensitivity assay in 118 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, (ii) clinical association analysis in the other 98 patients who had received chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e>, and (iii) biological utility assessment using cell viability assays of transfected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine SNPs related to bevacizumab and cetuximab regimen sensitivity were chosen during screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall responses for bevacizumab regimens revealed that patients carrying the TT genotype at ANXA11 rs1049550 or at least one G allele at LINS1 rs11247226 seemed greater chemosensitive than those carrying at least one C allele or the AA genotype, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For cetuximab regimens, patients carrying the GG genotype at DFNB31 rs2274159 or LIFR rs3729740 seemed greater chemosensitive than those carrying at least one A allele (P = 0.025 and P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity analyses showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> RKO and HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> clones transfected with the G allele at LIFR rs3729740 and the C allele at ISX rs361863 were more sensitive to cetuximab regimens than those with the A and T allele, respectively (P â‰¤ 0.001-0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensitive SNP markers were identified using a novel three-step process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The candidate marker LIFR rs3729740 and possibly ISX rs361863 will hopefully predict responsive patients to cetuximab regimens, although further validation is needed in large cohorts </plain></SENT>
