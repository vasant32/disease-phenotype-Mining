<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Gharbiah <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry is the only population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry in Egypt since 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the data of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients included in the registry for the period of 1999-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> medical records of the 1364 patients diagnosed in Gharbiah during the study period were retrieved and the following information abstracted: age, residence, diagnosis date, grade, stage, topology, clinical characteristics, and histology variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Egyptian census data for 1996 and 2006 were used to provide the general population's statistics on age, sex, residence and other related demographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to age- and sex-specific incidence rate analyses, we analyze the data to explore the incidence distribution by rural-urban differences among the 8 districts of the province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also compared the incidence rates of Gharbiah to the rates of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data of the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the 9 year-period, 1364 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disease incidence under age 40 years was relatively high (1.3/10(5)) while the incidence in the age groups 40 and over was very low (12.0/10(5), 19.4/10(5) and 21.2/10(5) in the age groups 40-59 years, 60-69 years and &gt; 70 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (97.2%) had no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and 37.2% of the patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e> in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> was more common in patients from urban (55%) than rural (45%) areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regional differences in colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> incidence in the 8 districts of the study province may reflect different etiologic patterns in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The registry data of Egypt shows a slightly higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> than the United States in subjects under age 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results also shows significantly lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in subjects over age 40 years compared to the same age group in the United States SEER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, low incidence in older subjects, and high rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in Egypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future studies should explore clinical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">molecular disease</z:e> patterns </plain></SENT>
