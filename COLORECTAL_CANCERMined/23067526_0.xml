<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of (18)F-FDG PET-CT in the diagnosis of recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in patients with elevated values of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and/or signs of recurrence in the multidetector CT (MDCT), and to demonstrate that good results can be obtained applying the ALARA principles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 54 patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, who underwent an (18)F-FDG PET-CT, administering a mean dose of 222 MBq (6 mCi) of (18)F-FDG, from 07/2007 to 01/2011 was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were excluded, thus studying 47 (27 males, 20 females, mean age 63 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was confirmed by histopathology study in 14 cases and by clinical evolution in 33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 4 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A: patients with elevation of CEA and suspected recurrence in the MDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B: elevation of CEA, without suspicious lesions in the MDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>C: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of CEA and positive MDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>D: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of CEA and uncertain MDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, NPV and overall accuracy of 91%, 69%, 89%, 75% and 85% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For group A, we found 100% sensitivity, in group B, 75% sensitivity with 100% specificity%, for C, sensitivity was 89% with 71% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, in group D, sensitivity was 100% and specificity 60%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Applying a low dose, the (18)F-FDG PET-CT has high diagnostic performance in patients with suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, approaching in a higher grade the ALARA criteria </plain></SENT>
