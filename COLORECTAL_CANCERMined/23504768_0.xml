<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The addition of an antiepidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR)-directed monoclonal antibody to chemotherapy for these patients significantly improved progression-free survival, response rates, and R0 resection rates to a greater extent than overall survival compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, 2 recent randomized phase 3 trials, the MRC COIN trial and the Nordic VII trial, reported an unexpected lack of benefit from the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy in the first-line setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, recent retrospective analyses performed on a pooled data set from major clinical trials added more complexity, reporting an unexpected association of KRAS G13D mutation with a better clinical outcome compared with patients who had other KRAS mutations in the first-line and salvage settings, whereas the other independent analysis failed to demonstrate a benefit from panitumumab in patients with the same KRAS G13D mutation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, the authors analyze the previous randomized clinical trials and more critically re-evaluate recent trials and subgroup analyses to derive 3 factors that need to be taken into consideration regarding the addition of EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies to chemotherapy: the preclinical data on mechanisms of action between chemotherapy and anti-EGFR antibodies along with mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies, the role of cross-over events in overall survival data, and the significant dose reductions of chemotherapeutic agents when combined with anti-EGFR agents </plain></SENT>
