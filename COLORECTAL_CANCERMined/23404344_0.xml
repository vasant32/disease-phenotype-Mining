<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether (18)FDG PET-CT can predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response after CRT in patients with LARC, in terms of downstaging and pCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2009 and February 2012, 151 patients with LARC treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by radical surgery were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-CRT SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake value), post-CRT SUVmax, ΔSUVmax (difference between pre- and post-CRT SUVmax), and RI-SUV (response index) were measured before and after CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyse the association of PET-CT-related parameters and clinical variables, to assess downstaging and pCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Downstaging occurred in 48 patients (31.7 %) and pCR in 19 patients (12.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed post-CRT SUVmax as a significant factor for prediction of downstaging, with sensitivity of 60.4 %, specificity of 65.0 %, and accuracy of 55.9 %, for a cutoff value of 3.70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding pCR, post-CRT SUVmax was again found as a significant parameter by univariate and multivariate analysis, with sensitivity of 73.7 %, specificity of 63.7 %, and accuracy of 64.9 %, for a cutoff value of 3.55 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that post-CRT SUVmax independently predicts downstaging and pCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the predictive values of post-CRT SUVmax for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response after neoadjuvant CRT are too low in sensitivity and specificity to change the treatment plan for LARC </plain></SENT>
