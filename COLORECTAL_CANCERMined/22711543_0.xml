<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genes that drive 20q gain are expected to show correlation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels with 20q DNA copy number status while functionally influencing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSE1L, DIDO1 and RBM39 are located on the 20q amplicon and affect processes such as cell viability and anchorage-independent growth in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate whether CSE1L, DIDO1 and RBM39 may drive 20q amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Protein expression levels were examined by immunohistochemical evaluation of tissue microarrays containing a series of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> samples, which were characterized by genome-wide (microarray-based) DNA and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSE1L, DIDO1 and RBM39 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels correlated with chromosome 20q DNA copy number status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSE1L protein expression was not associated with 20q gain, although its expression was increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DIDO1 and RBM39 protein expression was quite strong in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> irrespective of 20q DNA copy number status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lack of correlation between protein expression levels and 20q DNA copy number status implies that CSE1L, DIDO1 and RBM39 are merely passengers rather than drivers of chromosome 20q gain in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-to-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> progression </plain></SENT>
