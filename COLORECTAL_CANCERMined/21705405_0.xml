<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In high-throughput studies of diseases, terms enriched with disease-related genes based on Gene Ontology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>) are routinely found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most current algorithms used to find significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> terms cannot handle the redundancy that results from the dependencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simply based on some numerical considerations, current algorithms developed for reducing this redundancy may produce results that do not account for biologically interesting cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article, we present several rules used to design a tool called <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>-function for extracting biologically relevant terms from statistically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> terms for a disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using one gene expression profile for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>-function with four algorithms designed to treat redundancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, we validated results obtained in this data set by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>-function using another data set for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>-function can identify disease-related terms that are more statistically and biologically meaningful than those found by the other four algorithms </plain></SENT>
