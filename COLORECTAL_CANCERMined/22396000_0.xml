<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to quantify the excess mortality in the first postoperative year of stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and to identify risk factors for excess mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 2,131 patients who were operated with curative intent for stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the western region of the Netherlands between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality and relative survival were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, relative excess risk (RER) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was estimated by a multivariable model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 4.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-year mortality was 12.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for excess mortality in the first postoperative year for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients were emergency surgery (excess mortality 29.7%, RER 2.5, 95% confidence interval 2.5-5.0), a Charlson score of &gt;1 (excess mortality 12.6%, RER 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.5-3.7), stage II or III disease (excess mortality 14.9%, RER 3.9, 95% confidence interval 1.9-8.1), and postoperative adverse events (excess mortality 22.6%, RER 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day mortality rate highly underestimates the risk of dying in the first year after surgery, with excess 1-year mortality rates varying from 15 to 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This excess mortality was especially prominent in patients with comorbidities, higher stages of disease, emergency surgery, and postoperative surgical complications </plain></SENT>
