<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None of these polyomaviruses were detected in colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>JCV DNA was detected in 2 of 67 patients (2.9%) with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disorders, but neither BKV nor SV40 was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BKV was found in urine from 38.5% and 28.6% of adult and pediatric transplant recipients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adult renal transplant recipients, excretion of BKV in urine was significantly associated with episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection (p=0.012) and with excretion of HCMV in urine (p= 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Cuba, the polyomaviruses studied here could not be related to colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and JCV was rarely detected in CSFs of HIV-1-infected individuals, whilst BKV reactivation was found to occur frequently in organ transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
