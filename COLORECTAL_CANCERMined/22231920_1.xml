<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological studies have found an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and faster disease progression in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether patients with T2DM are diagnosed with more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, i. e., metastasized disease (UICC III and IV), at the time of diagnosis, since such a finding may have an impact on future guidelines for patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stages at diagnosis in patients with (18.0%) or without (82%) T2DM were compared using logistic regression analysis to correct for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with T2DM were older, more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and more often male (each p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, patients with T2DM had a lower risk for metastasized disease at diagnosis (p=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correction for age, gender, BMI, smoking and aspirin intake in a multiple logistic regression analysis did not change the result (OR=0.57, p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When looking at individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stages rather than collapsed categories, there was a trend for less advanced stages in patients with T2DM (p=0.093) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excluding stage I because of potential screening bias due to the introduction of (insurance-covered) colonoscopy screening improved model fit, and confirmed less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> stages (p=0.0246) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Possibly because of earlier detection, patients with T2DM may be at lower risk for advanced stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to confirm our results and to investigate the impact of closer medical surveillance in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
