<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rates of colorectal endoscopy are still far below those recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether factors such as the supply of gastroenterologists and the proportion of the local population without health insurance coverage were related to the likelihood of having the procedure, and whether these factors explained racial and ethnic differences in colorectal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found evidence that improving access to health care at the county and individual levels through expanded health insurance coverage could improve colorectal endoscopy use but might not be sufficient to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Policy action to address these disparities will need to consider other structural and cultural factors that may be inhibiting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
