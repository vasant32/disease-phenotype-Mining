<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2002 through 2005, a total of 1430 primary care patients (578 whites and 852 African Americans) from Jefferson Family Medicine Associates, a large primary care practice affiliated with Thomas Jefferson University, completed a baseline survey and were randomized to 1 of 4 groups, as follows: control (usual care), standard intervention (SI), tailored intervention (TI), or tailored intervention plus phone (TIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SI group received a targeted print intervention by mail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TI group received the targeted intervention and tailored message pages that addressed perceptions related to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TIP group received the targeted intervention, tailored message pages, and a telephone reminder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates for whites and African Americans were comparable in usual care (33% versus 32%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In response to intervention, however, whites exhibited significantly higher (p=0.005) screening rates than African Americans (53% versus 43%, respectively; adjusted OR=1.44; 95% CI=1.12-1.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect is largely explained by differential response to mailed print interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whites and African Americans may respond differently to mailed interventions intended to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Research is needed on methods that can both increase screening and racial equity in screening </plain></SENT>
