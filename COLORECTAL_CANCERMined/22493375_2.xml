<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multi-institutional study, 74 patients were randomly assigned to receive DEBIRI (36) versus systemic irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI, 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost and influence of molecular markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 50 months, overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with DEBIRI than for those treated with FOLFIRI (p=0.031, log-rank) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 22 (95% Confidence Interval CI=21-23) months, for DEBIRI and 15 (95% CI=12-18) months for FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival was 7 (95% CI=3-11) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 4 (95% CI=3-5) months in the FOLFIRI group and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p=0.006, log-rank) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extrahepatic progression had occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by the end of the study, at a median time of 13 (95% CI=10-16) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 9 (95% CI 5-13) months in the FOLFIRI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference between groups was not observed (p=0.064, log-rank).The median time for duration of improvement to quality of life was 8 (95% CI=3-13) months in the DEBIRI group and 3 (95% CI=2-4) months in the FOLFIRI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in duration of improvement was statistically significant (p=0.00002, log-rank) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant difference between DEBIRI and FOLFIRI for overall survival (7 months), progression-free survival (3 months) and quality of life (5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, a clinically significant improvement in time to extrahepatic progression (4 months) was observed for DEBIRI, a reversal of the expectation for a regional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests a benefit of DEBIRI treatment over standard chemotherapy and serves to establish the expected difference between these two treatment options for planning future large randomized studies </plain></SENT>
