<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-mucosa tissue samples from 78 CRC patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RalBP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RalBP1 was found to be overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level both overall (p = 0.027), and for stages I (p = 0.024), II (p = 0.038) and IV (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the protein level, RalBP1 was only significantly overexpressed in stage IV patients (p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of RalBP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were inversely correlated (r = 0.4173; p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis including sex, age, stage, grade, and nodal status as covariates showed that overexpression of RalBP1 protein, but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, was an independent predictor of both decreased disease free survival (p = 0.016, RR = 6.892) and overall survival (p = 0.039, RR = 5.986) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that RalBP1 protein is an independent predictor of poor survival and early relapse for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Owing to its multifunctional intermediary role in cell survival, chemotherapeutic resistance, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> formation, RalBP1 represents a promising novel therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
