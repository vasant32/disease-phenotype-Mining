<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2009, an evidence-based review process conducted by the independent Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention Working Group resulted in a recommendation to offer genetic testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with the intent of reducing morbidity and mortality in family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore issues surrounding implementation of this recommendation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a multidisciplinary working group meeting in September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article reviews background information regarding screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> and summarizes existing clinical paradigms, potential implementation strategies, and conclusions which emerged from the meeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was recognized that widespread implementation will present substantial challenges, and additional data from pilot studies will be needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, evidence of feasibility and population health benefits and the advantages of considering a public health approach were acknowledged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> can potentially serve as a model to facilitate the development and implementation of population-level programs for evidence-based genomic medicine applications involving follow-up testing of at-risk relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such endeavors will require multilevel and multidisciplinary approaches building on collaborative public health and clinical partnerships </plain></SENT>
