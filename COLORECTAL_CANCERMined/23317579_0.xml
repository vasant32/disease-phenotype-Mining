<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Race has been shown to influence the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, thus leading to the recommendation of initiating screening in blacks at the age of 45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few data exist on the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colon polyps</z:mp> among U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate (ADR) between Hispanics and whites undergoing a first screening colonoscopy at our referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single endoscopy unit, tertiary care teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients 50 years of age or older undergoing their first screening colonoscopy whose race was determined as white or Hispanic from June 2007 to August 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: ADR by race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the ADR among Hispanics and whites (45% and 48%, respectively; P = .2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was found when comparing the ADR in Hispanic and white males (50% and 55%, respectively; P = .2), Hispanic and white females (40% in both groups), or in the 50- to 59-year-old subgroup (42% in Hispanics, 45% in whites, P = .4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the prevalence of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (3% in Hispanics, 4% in whites, P = .3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in Hispanics and whites was similar (18% and 19%, respectively, P = .8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, self-identification of race/ethnicity, underrepresentation of certain Hispanic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a similar ADR among Hispanics and whites undergoing their first screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings have important implications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening recommendations, suggesting that the current guidelines are appropriate for Hispanics </plain></SENT>
