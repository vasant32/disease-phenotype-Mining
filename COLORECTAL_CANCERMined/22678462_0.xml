<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: We examined whether the insertion time for colonoscopies performed after left-sided resection was different in patients with a colostomy from that in patients without a colostomy and identified factors that could impact colonoscopy performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy between July 2005 and March 2011 after left-sided colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We classified surgical methods according to the presence or absence of a colostomy and evaluated colonoscope insertion time retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we analyzed factors that might affect insertion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,041 patients underwent colonoscopy after left-sided colorectal resection during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The colonoscopy completion rate was 98.6 %, and the mean insertion time was 6.1 Â± 4.6 min (median 4.7 min, range 0.3-35.8 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A shorter resection length of colon, the presence of a colostomy, and a lower endoscopist case volume were found to be independent factors associated with prolonged insertion time in patients with left-sided colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among experienced colonoscopists, no colonoscopy-associated or clinical factors were found to affect insertion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a shorter resection length of colon, the presence of a colostomy, and poor bowel preparation were associated with prolonged insertion time among inexperienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified three factors that affect colonoscope insertion time after left-sided colorectal resection, including the presence of a colostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inexperienced endoscopists were much more affected by the presence of a colostomy after left-sided colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for the practice and teaching of colonoscopy after left-sided colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
