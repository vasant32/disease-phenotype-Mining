<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Loop ileostomy is a suitable procedure for transitory faecal diversion after low colorectal anastomosis, but it causes relevant morbidities (discomfort, peristomal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>) and requires a second operation to be closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We already described an alternative technique of temporary percutaneous ileostomy (TPI) that can be removed without surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The data of 143 consecutive patients, undergoing elective laparoscopic anterior resection of the rectum for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and low mechanical colorectal anastomosis, 68 with conventional loop ileostomy (CLI) and 75 with TPI, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither intra-operative complications nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical anastomotic leakage occurred in 4 patients with CLI and in 1 with TPI (p = 0.191) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time required for the emission of gases and faeces through the stoma was respectively 1 and 2.5 days in the CLI group, and 1 and 2 days in the TPI group (p = 0.259 and p = 0.126) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median post-operative stay was 8 days in the CLI group and 11 days in the TPI group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PTIs were removed on the median of 9 days after surgery without major complications, whereas the CLIs were re-canalized in 79.4% of patients on an average of 106 days, with 2 major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The temporary percutaneous ileostomy seems to be a valid alternative to conventional ileostomy, ensuring optimal faecal diversion and less patient discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be easily removed without surgery, allowing patients a better outcome </plain></SENT>
