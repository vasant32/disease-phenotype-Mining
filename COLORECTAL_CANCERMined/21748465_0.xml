<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening for issues such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> is being adopted in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> settings, but its effectiveness or the relationship between these risk factors in this population are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 836 health assessment forms provided to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients referred to an outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nutritional (Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment) and psychological (Psychosocial Screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>) screening tools were included in the form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and screening tool information was obtained from completed forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of nutritional risk, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were determined based on screening tool scores and clinical cutoffs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An ordinal regression model was fitted to determine which demographic and psychosocial factors best predicted nutritional risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 252 (30%) of the forms were completed enough for inclusion in analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of nutritional risk, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were determined to be 29%, 10%, and 7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A regression model containing the variables <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, gender, health coverage, and marital status was found to best explain the nutritional score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was the most significant predictor, with odds of increased nutritional risk being 5.6 times greater for depressed individuals (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of nutritional and psychosocial screening tools is warranted and needs to be emphasized more in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There appears to be a relationship between psychosocial issues and increased nutritional risk which should be taken into account when considering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care interventions </plain></SENT>
