<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to explore, for the first time, whether mildly elevated circulating UCB, as found in Gilbert`s syndrome (GS), is associated with changes of DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A random 76 individuals, matched for age and gender, were recruited from the general population and allocated into the GS group (UCB ≥ 17.1 µM; n = 38) or control group (UCB &lt;17.1 µM; n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal and cytological changes were determined in lymphocytes and buccal cells using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay (CBMN) and buccal micronucleus cytome assay (BMcyt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between GS subjects and the control group in the CBMN and BMcyt determined endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, when age dependency of effects were analysed, lower formation of buccal micronucleated cells (by 73.3%) and buccal nuclear buds (by 70.9%) in the GS subgroup ≥ 30 years were found, compared to the GS subgroup &lt;30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest DNA protection in epithelial tissue of older individuals with GS </plain></SENT>
