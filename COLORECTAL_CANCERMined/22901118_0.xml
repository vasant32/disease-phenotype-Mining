<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The appropriate interval between negative colonoscopy screenings is uncertain, but the numbers of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> 10 years after a negative result are generally low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> screening and management based on repeat screening colonoscopy every 10 years or single colonoscopy, compared with no screening in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: A state-transition Markov model simulated 100,000 individuals aged 50-80 years accepting repeat screening colonoscopy every 10 years or single colonoscopy, offered to every subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> found during colonoscopy were removed by polypectomy, and the subjects were followed with surveillance every three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For subjects with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> result, colonoscopy was resumed within ten years in the repeat screening strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In single screening strategy, screening process was terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct costs such as screening tests, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment and costs of complications were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indirect costs were excluded from the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost- effectiveness ratio was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different screening strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Assuming a first-time compliance rate of 90%, repeat screening colonoscopy and single colonoscopy can reduce the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by 65.8% and 67.2% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for single colonoscopy (49 Renminbi Yuan [RMB]) was much lower than that for repeat screening colonoscopy (474 RMB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Single colonoscopy was a more cost-effective strategy, which was not sensitive to the compliance rate of colonoscopy and the cost of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Single colonoscopy is suggested to be the more cost-effective strategy for screening and management of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and may be recommended in China clinical practice </plain></SENT>
