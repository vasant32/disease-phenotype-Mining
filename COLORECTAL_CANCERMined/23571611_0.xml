<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to describe the distribution and characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> removed in colonoscopy screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective registry of a colonoscopy-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program was developed on asymptomatic individuals over 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were removed and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyp</z:mpath> size and histology were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenomas</z:mpath> were considered advanced if they measured greater than 10 mm or were tubulovillous, villous, or malignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of advanced proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was determined and patients were categorized according to their family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 696 individuals (418 women), aged 57.7Â±10.3 years, were examined; 45.8% presented a colonic lesion, being <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in 32.7% individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these, 24.7% were advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (0.6%) presented invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences with respect to sex and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between patients with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenomas</z:mpath> were more prevalent in individuals aged at least 65, irrespective of location (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 65.1% of individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in the right colon, there were no synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in the left colon (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were also present in the right colon of patients with no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in the right colon showed no synchronic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> on theleft side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Lesions on the right side would have gone undetected if the individuals undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening had been explored with proctosigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
