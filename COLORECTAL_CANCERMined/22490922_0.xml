<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and examination of tissue at microscopic resolution have significant potential to enhance the study of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and disease processes, particularly those involving structural changes or those in which the spatial relationship of disease features is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although other methods exist for studying tissue in 3D, using conventional histopathological features has significant advantages because it allows for conventional histopathological staining and interpretation techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until now, its use has not been routine in research because of the technical difficulty in constructing 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519523" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">tissue models</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel system for 3D histological reconstruction, integrating whole-slide imaging (virtual slides), image serving, registration, and visualization into one user-friendly package </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It produces high-resolution 3D reconstructions with minimal user interaction and can be used in a histopathological laboratory without input from computing specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It uses a novel method for slice-to-slice image registration using automatic registration algorithms custom designed for both virtual slides and histopathological images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This system has been applied to &gt;300 separate 3D volumes from eight different tissue types, using a total of 5500 virtual slides comprising 1.45 TB of primary image data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and quantitative metrics for the accuracy of 3D reconstruction are provided, with measured registration accuracy approaching 120 Î¼m for a 1-cm piece of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both 3D tissue volumes and generated 3D models are presented for four demonstrator cases </plain></SENT>
