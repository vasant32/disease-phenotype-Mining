<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent phase I study by our group using hyperthermic intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> has demonstrated its safety and appropriate dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal in this study is to present a single institution's experience with the hematologic toxicities of the two agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 187 patients with PC of colorectal or appendiceal origin who underwent HIPEC with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> between October 2006 and September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicities were graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 187 patients, 55 had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based HIPEC while 132 patients received <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy was performed in 95 patients (50.8%) due to disease involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When comparing hematologic toxicity for <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> among the cohort of patients who underwent splenectomy, a statistically significant difference was noted in the incidence of platelet (P = .02) and neutrophil (P = .05) toxicity, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> having a higher incidence of grade 3 and grade 4 platelet and neutrophil toxicity respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no statistically significant difference in hematologic toxicity was noted between the two agents in patients who did not undergo splenectomy during cytoreductive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based HIPEC for PC of colorectal and appendiceal origin is associated with similar white blood cell toxicity and higher platelet and neutrophil toxicity compared to <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>-based HIPEC </plain></SENT>
