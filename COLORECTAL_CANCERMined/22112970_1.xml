<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: FDG-PET/CT scans were carried out at baseline and on day 14 in 41 patients with unresectable mCRC treated with a biweekly regimen of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metabolic nonresponse was defined by &lt;15% decrease in FDG uptake in the dominant proportion of the patient's lesions or if a lesion was found metabolically progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PET-based response was correlated with radiological response (primary end point) and patient's outcome (secondary end points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RECIST response rate in metabolically responding patients was 43% (10 of 23) compared with 0% (0 of 17) in nonresponding patients (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The metabolic assessment's predictive performance for RECIST response was sensitivity 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 69% to 100%], specificity 57% (95% CI 37% to 75%), positive predictive value 43% (95% CI 23% to 66%), and negative predictive value 100% (95% CI 80% to 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing metabolically responding versus nonresponding patients, the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.28 (95% CI 0.10-0.76) for overall survival and 0.57 (95% CI 0.27-1.21) for progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The metabolic response measured by FDG-PET/CT after a single course of chemotherapy in mCRC is able to identify patients who will not benefit from the treatment </plain></SENT>
