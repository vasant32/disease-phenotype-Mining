<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is considered an attractive target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small molecules derived from the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> were used in our cell-based reporter gene assay to identify potential inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnolol, a neolignan from the cortex of Magnolia obovata, was identified as a promising candidate because it effectively inhibited β-catenin/TCF reporter gene (TOPflash) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnolol also suppressed Wnt3a-induced β-catenin translocation and subsequent target gene expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the precise mechanisms of action in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by magnolol, we performed Western blot analysis, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with aberrantly activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnolol inhibited the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and significantly suppressed the binding of β-catenin/TCF complexes onto their specific DNA-binding sites in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These events led to the down-regulation of β-catenin/TCF-targeted downstream genes such as c-myc, matrix metalloproteinase-7, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator in SW480 and HCT116 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, magnolol inhibited the invasion and motility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and exhibited antitumor activity in a xenograft <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse model bearing HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the growth inhibition of magnolol against human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells can be partly attributed to the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
