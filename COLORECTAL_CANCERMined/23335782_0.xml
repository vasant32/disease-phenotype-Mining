<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The consumption of red meat is a risk factor in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that red meat facilitates the nitrosation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36249">bile acid conjugates</z:chebi> and amino acids, which rapidly convert to DNA-damaging carcinogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the toxic and mutagenic DNA adduct O(6)-carboxymethylguanine (O(6)-CMG) is frequently present in human DNA, increases in abundance in people with high levels of dietary red meat and may therefore be a causative factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous reports suggested that O(6)-CMG is not a substrate for the human version of the DNA damage reversal protein O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which protects against the genotoxic effects of other O(6)-alkylguanine lesions by removing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22323">alkyl groups</z:chebi> from the O(6)-position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now show that synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing the known MGMT substrate O(6)-methylguanine (O(6)-MeG) or O(6)-CMG effectively inactivate MGMT in vitro (IC50 0.93 and 1.8 nM, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inactivation involves the removal of the O(6)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22323">alkyl group</z:chebi> and its transfer to the active-site <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> of MGMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>O(6)-CMG is therefore an MGMT substrate, and hence MGMT is likely to be a protective factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> under conditions where O(6)-CMG is a potential causative agent </plain></SENT>
