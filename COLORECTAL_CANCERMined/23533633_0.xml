<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding these networks will be essential to combat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focussed on central players in such networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a series of colon and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, we found that CD24 activates Src, and induces the activation of c-Jun and expression of c-Jun and c-Fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereby CD24 increases the promoter activity and expression of miR-21, which in turn suppresses expression of Pdcd4 and PTEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-transfection of a CD24 expression construct and an siRNA that silences Src showed that CD24-dependent upregulation of miR-21 is mediated by Src </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found that miR-34a post-transcriptionally downregulates CD24 and Src expression, leading to the deactivation of c-Jun, reduced expression of c-Jun and c-Fos, inhibition of miR-21, and upregulation of Pdcd4 and PTEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-34a-mediated inhibition of Src expression reduced migration and invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues from 26 colorectal patients showed significantly lower expression of Pdcd4 and miR-34a, and higher expression of CD24, Src and miR-21 compared to the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CD24 positively correlated with the amount of Src protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues, and a trend towards an inverse correlation between miR-34a and Src protein levels was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal essential players in the complex networks that regulate the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings therefore identify novel therapeutic approaches for combating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and progression </plain></SENT>
