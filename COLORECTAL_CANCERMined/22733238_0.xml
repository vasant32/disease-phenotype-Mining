<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we systematically assessed the feasibility of inferring ethnic trends in chemotherapy outcomes from inter-ethnic differences in pharmacogenetic variant frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of 51 variants and chemotherapy outcomes of East Asian and Caucasian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients on standard chemotherapy regimens were summarized by meta-analyses, and variant frequencies were validated by MassARRAY analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inferences of relative chemotherapy outcomes were made by considering minor allele function and population differences in their frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant population differences in genotype distributions were observed for 13/23 (60%) and 27/35 (77%) variants in the meta-analyses and validation series, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Across chemotherapy regimens, East Asians had lower rates of grade 3/4 toxicity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>/mucositis than Caucasians, which was correctly inferred from 13/18 (72%, P=0.018) informative genetic variants </plain></SENT>
