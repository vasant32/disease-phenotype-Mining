<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a key enzyme involved in the repair of radiation-induced single-strand DNA breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PARP inhibitors such as olaparib (KU-0059436, AZD-2281) enhance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sensitivity to radiation and to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50276">topoisomerase I inhibitors</z:chebi> like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Olaparib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of PARP-1 and PARP-2 that has been tested in multiple clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of the sensitizing effect of olaparib for radiation and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> in order to support clinical application of this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DLD-1 cells (a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line) and H1299 cells (a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e> cell line) with differences of p53 gene status were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival of these cells was determined by clonogenic assay after treatment with drugs and X-ray irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The γH2AX focus formation assay was performed to examine the influence of olaparib on induction and repair of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> breaks after exposure to radiation or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A radiosensitizing effect of olaparib was seen even at 0.01 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its radiosensitizing effect after exposure for 2 h was similar to that after 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>H1299 cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> or mutation of p53 were more radioresistant than H1299 cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, similar enhancement of radiosensitization by olaparib was observed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the tested cell lines regardless of the p53 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Olaparib also sensitized cells to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This sensitizing effect was seen at low concentrations of olaparib such as 0.01 μM, and its sensitizing effect was the same at both 0.01 μM and 1 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The combination of olaparib and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> had a stronger radiosensitizing effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results of the γH2AX focus assay corresponded with the clonogenic assay findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Olaparib enhanced sensitivity to radiation and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> at low concentrations and after relatively short exposure times such as 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The radiosensitizing effect of olaprib was not dependent on the p53 status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These characteristics could be advantageous for clinical radiotherapy since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells may be exposed to low concentrations of olaparib and/or may have different levels of p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The combination of olaparib and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> had a stronger radiosensitizing effect, indicating that combining a PARP inihibitor with a topoiomerase I inhibitor could be promising for clinical radiosensitization </plain></SENT>
