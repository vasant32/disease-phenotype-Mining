<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CRNDE is the gene symbol for Colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasia</z:hpo> Differentially Expressed (non-protein-coding), a long non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (lncRNA) gene that expresses multiple splice variants and displays a very tissue-specific pattern of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CRNDE was initially identified as a lncRNA whose expression is highly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but it is also upregulated in many other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, CRNDE is the most upregulated lncRNA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> and here, as in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, it is associated with a "stemness" signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRNDE is expressed in specific regions within the human and mouse brain; the mouse ortholog is high in induced pluripotent stem cells and increases further during neuronal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CRNDE is a multifunctional lncRNA whose different splice forms provide specific functional scaffolds for regulatory complexes, such as the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and CoREST chromatin-modifying complexes, which CRNDE helps pilot to target genes </plain></SENT>
