<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incidental appendectomy during colorectal resections is performed at the discretion of the operating surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This retrospective study used data from 1352 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1993 and 2009 at the Medical University of Vienna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated histopathological results of appendices removed incidentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, complications and costs of the additional intervention were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Appendectomy had been performed in 314 (23.22%) patients because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">appendicitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidental appendectomy had been performed in 380 (28.11%) patients: 86 (22.63%) had a histologically completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appendix, a pathologic alteration was found in 289 (76.05%) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was found in seven (1.84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred from the additional surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The costs and time effort were negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Incidental appendectomy is a safe procedure and can be integrated into surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> to avoid future complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pathological findings of the appendix, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, are frequent but the clinical relevance remains questionable </plain></SENT>
