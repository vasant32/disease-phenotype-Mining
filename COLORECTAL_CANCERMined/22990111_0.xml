<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Signal-induced proliferation-associated gene 1 (SIPA1) codes for a GTPase-activating protein, known to be a negative regulator of Ras-related Protein (RAP) which belongs to the Ras superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been implicated in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However the role of this molecule in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to investigate the expression of SIPA1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> tissues and its impact on the function of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 94 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues together with 80 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> background tissues were used to examine the expression of SIPA1 transcript and protein using real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical methods, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any association with clinical and histopathological characteristics was then identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ribozyme transgenes targeting SIPA1 were prepared to knockdown the expression of SIPA1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impact on their functions was subsequently determined, using respective in vitro function assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increased expression of SIPA1 was evident in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues compared with its expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> background tissues (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e>, its expression appeared to be lower in poorly-differentiated samples and in patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of SIPA1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells resulted in reduced cell growth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The knockdown exhibited a contrasting effect on invasion and migration, both of which were increased in SIPA1-knockdown cells compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SIPA1 is up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This suggests that SIPA1 plays diverse roles during disease progression as has contrasting effects on growth and motility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
