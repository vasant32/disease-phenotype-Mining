<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major pitfall of the 2-stage hepatectomy procedure is a high dropout rate after the 1st-stage hepatectomy due to progression of disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Routine use of CT×2 has been advocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 47 patients with multiple, bilateral unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were selected for a 2-stage hepatectomy procedure (±<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein occlusion</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the total, 37 patients (78.7%) underwent systemic chemotherapy before the 1st-stage hepatectomy (CT×1) and 25 patients (53.2%) underwent CT×2; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> was significantly more common during CT×2 than during CT×1 (P=.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 47 patients planned for the 2nd-stage hepatectomy, 36 (76.6%) completed the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 47 patients, 25 (53.2%) showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> after the 1st-stage hepatectomy, 12 in the CT×2 group and 13 in the no-CT×2 group; administration of CT×2 did not significantly affect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> rate (P=.561) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall dropout rate was 23.4% (n=11 patients): 16% in the CT×2 group vs. 31.8% in the no-CT×2 group (P=.303) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of chemotherapy between the 1st- and 2nd-stage hepatectomy does not guarantee lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and dropout rates </plain></SENT>
