<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Roughly, 1 out of 3 patients with a colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> has a rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgery is the cornerstone in the curative treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 1980s with conventional surgery, the 5-year local recurrence rate was over 20% and the 5-year overall survival rate around 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Swedish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal Cancer</z:e> trial, in which 1,168 patients were included, preoperative radiotherapy in addition to conventional surgery resulted in a reduction of more than 50% in the 5-year local recurrence rate in comparison to conventional surgery alone (11 vs. 27%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the 5-year overall survival rate improved from 48 to 58% if patients were treated with preoperative radiotherapy in addition to conventional surgery (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With total mesorectal excision (TME), by which the rectum with its mesorectum and visceral fascia are dissected sharply and under direct vision, local recurrence rates dropped and overall survival improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the Dutch TME trial, 5 × 5 Gy preoperative radiotherapy in combination with TME surgery was compared to TME surgery alone (1,861 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this trial, the 5-year local recurrence rate for patients treated with TME surgery alone was similar to patients treated in the Swedish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal Cancer</z:e> trial with blunt dissection in combination with preoperative 5 × 5 Gy radiotherapy (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If preoperative radiotherapy was added to TME surgery, the 5-year local recurrence rate was reduced to 5.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate at 5 years was 64% for both patients treated with TME surgery alone and patients treated with preoperative radiotherapy followed by TME surgery, compared to 48% for patients treated with blunt dissection alone in the previously mentioned Swedish trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TME surgery is now considered the standard surgical procedure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, even if TME surgery is performed, surgical quality varies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>First, these results indicate that improvements in the surgical procedure itself can result in major progress regarding long-term oncological outcome, such as decreased local recurrence rates and improved overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Second, it illustrates that variation in surgical quality could lead to large differences in outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was shown that surgical variation is not only important for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, but also plays an important role for the outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
