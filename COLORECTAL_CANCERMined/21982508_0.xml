<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chances on curation of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are continuously improving with modern multi-modality treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> the focus lies on palliation of symptoms, which is not necessarily a resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both situations motivate adequate staging before treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This prospective observational study evaluates the outcomes after the introduction of routine staging with abdominal CT before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective observational study of 612 consecutive patients (2007-2009), the ability of abdominal CT to find <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (LM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) and T4 stage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (CC) was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was present in 58% of patients, mCRC in 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability to find LM was excellent (99%), cT4 stage CC good (86%) and PC poor (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the group of surgical patients with emergency presentations, the incidences of both mCRC (51%) and locally advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (LACC) (69%) were higher than in the elective group (20% and 26% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Staging tended to be omitted more often in the emergency group (35% versus 12% in elective surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The strengths of staging with abdominal CT are to find LM and LACC, however it fails in diagnosing PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On grounds of the incidence of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, staging is warranted in patients with emergency presentations as well </plain></SENT>
