<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of LY294002 (10 μM, 48 h) on the cytosolic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> and nuclear proteomes of human HT-29 CRC cells have been determined using iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cells treated with LY294002 identified 26 differentially abundant proteins that indicate several mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of protein changes were directly or indirectly associated with Myc and TNF-α, previously implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LY294002 decreased the levels of 6 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (average 0.39-fold) required for protein translation, 5 glycolytic enzymes (average 0.37-fold) required for ATP synthesis, and 3 chaperones required for protein folding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a 3.2-fold increase in lysozyme C involved in protein-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> hydrolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LY294002 increased cytosolic p53 with a concomitant decrease in nuclear p53, suggesting transfer of p53 to the cytosol where <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> might be initiated via the intrinsic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein changes described here suggest that the anti-angiogenic effects of LY294002 may be related to p53; the mutational status of p53 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may be an important determinant of the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors for treatment </plain></SENT>
