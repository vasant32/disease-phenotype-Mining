<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The seventh TNM edition was released in 2009 with the aim of providing a more precise prediction of prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and histopathological data of 2229 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection between 1990 and 2006 were analyzed and compared by using the sixth and seventh editions of the TNM classification and a statistically calculated model of prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With the sixth edition, 5-year survival was 96% for stage I, 90% for IIA, 86% for IIB, 90% for IIIA, 72% for IIIB, 48% for IIIC, and 13% for IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the seventh edition, 5-year survival was 96% for stage I, 90% for IIA, 84% for IIB, 87% for IIC, 89% for IIIA, 72% for IIIB, 36% for IIIC, 15% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e>, and 10% for <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stage shifted for only 155 (7%) patients: from IIB to IIC (2%), from IIIB to IIIC (1%), and from IIIC to IIIA/B (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The performance of the seventh edition [concordance index (c-index) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82-0.85] revealed no relevant improvement compared with the sixth edition (c-index 0.83; 95% CI, 0.82-0.84), or compared to a model based on independent prognostic factors (c-index 0.84; 95% CI, 0.83-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The seventh TNM edition did not provide greater accuracy in predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients' prognosis but resulted in a more complex classification for daily clinical use </plain></SENT>
