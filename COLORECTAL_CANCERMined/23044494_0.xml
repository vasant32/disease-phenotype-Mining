<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted a broad evaluation of the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in innate immunity and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> pathways with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> risk and conducted comparisons with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> genome-wide association study (GWAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 378 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (cases) and a group of 450 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A proprietary oligonucleotide pool assay was used to genotype 1429 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for each SNP, and P values for trend (P(trend) ) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For statistically significant SNPs (P(trend) &lt; .05), the results were replicated with genotyped or imputed SNPs in the GWAS, and P values were adjusted for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the PLCO analysis, a significant association was observed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and 81 SNPs located in 44 genes (P(trend) &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 81 SNPS, there was evidence for confirmation in the GWAS for 10 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, the only SNP that retained a significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in the replication phase was reference SNP rs4648127 (nuclear factor of kappa light <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> gene enhancer of B-cells 1 [NFKB1]) (multiple testing-adjusted P(trend) = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> (CT)/TT genotype of NFKB1 was associated with reduced odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in the PLCO study (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.86) and the in the GWAS (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was observed between a variant in the NFKB1 gene and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The current findings add to evidence implicating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and immunity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> etiology </plain></SENT>
