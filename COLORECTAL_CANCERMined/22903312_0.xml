<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have a 1.5- to 2-fold excess risk of a second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as compared to the general population, the excess being higher at younger age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the risk and the age-relation of the incidence of second primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we considered 9,389 first colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> registered in the Vaud <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, Switzerland, between 1974 and 2008, and followed-up to the end of 2008 for a total of 44,113 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 136 second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> versus 90.5 expected, corresponding to a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.5 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.3-1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SIRs were not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> between men and women, and in strata of calendar year at diagnosis, duration of follow-up, and subsite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the SIR was 7.5 (95% CI 4.2-12.4) for subjects diagnosed below age 50 and declined thereafter to reach 1.0 (95% CI 0.6-1.6) at age 80 or over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the incidence of second primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was stable, and exceedingly high, around 300-400/100,000 between age 30-39 and 70 or over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This age pattern is consistent with the existence of a single mutational event in a population of highly susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
