<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although JCV DNA has been detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), the association between JCV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In China, the presence of JCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated JCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA load in Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and to determine whether the JCV DNA in peripheral blood (PB) can be used as a diagnostic marker for JCV-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> tissues, non-cancerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-adjacent tissues and PB samples were collected from 137 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 80 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissue samples from patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and PB samples from 100 healthy volunteers were also harvested as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>JCV DNA was detected by nested PCR and glass slide-based dot blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> DNA load of positive samples were determined by quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>JCV DNA was detected in 40.9% (56/137) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues at a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load of 49.1 to 10.3×10(4) copies/µg DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four (24.5%) non-cancerous colorectal tissues (192.9 to 4.4×10(3) copies/µg DNA) and 25 (18.2%) PB samples (81.3 to 4.9×10(3) copies/µg DNA) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were positive for JCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> tissues had higher levels of JCV than non-cancerous tissues (P = 0.003) or PB samples (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation between the presence of JCV and demographic or medical characteristics was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The JCV prevalence in PB samples was significantly associated with the JCV status in tissue samples (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eleven (13.8%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues and seven (7.0%) PB samples from healthy donors were positive for JCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: JCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is frequently present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> tissues of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the association between JCV presence in PB samples and JCV status in tissue samples was identified in this study, whether PB JCV detection can serve as a marker for JCV status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> requires further study </plain></SENT>
