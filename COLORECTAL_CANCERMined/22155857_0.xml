<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance rate (CCr) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study in objectively assessing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, a study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Sixty-eight patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FOLFOX-4 regimen was administrated as first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into CCr-impaired (60-80mL/min) and CCr-fair (&gt;80mL/min) groups before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NCV was examined accordingly, and the correlations of CCr and NCV with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An excellent correlation was identified in impaired CCr and the severity of neurological symptoms (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine (47.3%) CCr-impaired patients developed severe (grade 3 or 4) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and only 5 (10.2%) CCr-fair patients developed grade 3/4 neuropathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A good correlation was found in NCV abnormalities and the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, too (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (33.3%) patients with impaired NCV developed grade 3/4 neuropathy but only one (3.4%) patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NCV had grade 3/4 neuropathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there remained 26 (66.7%) NCV-impaired patients who had no or only mild neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CCr and NCV correlate well with the severity of neurological symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The additions of CCr and NCV, to a precise physical examination, are helpful in objectively assessing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
