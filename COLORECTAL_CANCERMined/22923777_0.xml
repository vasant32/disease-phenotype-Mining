<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With regards to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, lymph node retrieval is always laborious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sometimes, it is also a challenge to recover a minimum of 12 lymph nodes from the pericolorectal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among many proposed adjunctive solutions, GEWF solution (glacial <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, distilled water, and <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi>) has been introduced recently and suggested to be superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate its efficiency, the pericolorectal tissue, which has been reexamined extensively in the conventional condition, was refixed into GEWF solution in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More lymph nodes were found in 75% (n = 6) of the 8 experimental cases, and 50% (n = 4) of them had 12 or more yielded lymph nodes eventually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, no adverse influences on the expressions of immunohistochemical and special stains were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the reliability and effectiveness of GEWF solution in improvement of lymph node yield </plain></SENT>
