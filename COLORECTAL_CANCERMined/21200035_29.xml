<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy with detection and removal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> is considered a powerful tool to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the degree of protection achievable in a population setting with high-quality colonoscopy resources remains to be quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between previous colonoscopy and risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Rhine-Neckar region of Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 1688 case patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 1932 control participants aged 50 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: A detailed lifetime history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors and preventive factors, including history and results of previous colonoscopies, and of medical data obtained by self-reports and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> associated with colonoscopy in the preceding 10 years were estimated, after adjustment for sex, age, education level, participation in a general health screening examination, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, smoking status, body mass index, and use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> or hormone replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, colonoscopy in the preceding 10 years was associated with 77% lower risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjusted odds ratios for any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 0.23 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.27), 0.44 (CI, 0.35 to 0.55), and 0.16 (CI, 0.12 to 0.20), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Strong risk reduction was observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stages and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, except for right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in persons aged 50 to 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk reduction increased over the years in both the right and the left colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: The study was observational, with potential for residual confounding and selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy with polypectomy can be associated with strongly reduced risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the population setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Aside from strong risk reduction with respect to left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, risk reduction of more than 50% was also seen for right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
