<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective comprehensive review of clinical case notes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colorectal resections between October 2007 and October 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were identified through clinical coding and data were analyzed using SPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparison of 113 open versus 103 laparoscopic colorectal surgeries for various indications and short-term outcomes was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an expected overall increase in the laparoscopic colorectal resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 73 years for open and 68 years for laparoscopic surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to age, sex, and the American Society of Anaesthesiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 103 patients who were initially treated with laparoscopy-assisted colectomy, 12 (11.7%) were shifted to open procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perioperative recovery was faster in the laparoscopic-surgery group than in the open-colectomy group, as reflected by a shorter hospital stay (median, 8 vs. 13 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate was significantly less in the laparoscopy-assisted colectomy group than in the open-colectomy group (33% vs. 46%, P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our local hospital practices support the many benefits of laparoscopic colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Substantial improvements in rates of hospital stay and wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were noted, hence shifting our practice safely in a district general hospital </plain></SENT>
