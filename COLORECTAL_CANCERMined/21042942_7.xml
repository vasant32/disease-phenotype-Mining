<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data are lacking on the effect of these patterns on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained hepatobiliary database was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pattern and timing of recurrence and outcome after recurrence were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with outcome after recurrence were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From January 1997 through May 2003, a total of 733 patients underwent hepatectomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 637 patients (87%) were included in the analysis, and in 393 patients (62%), recurrence was documented at the time of last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial recurrence patterns included the following: liver only in 120 patients (31%), lung only in 107 (27%), other single sites in 49 (12%), and multiple sites in 117 (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrence occurred within 2 years of hepatectomy in 75% of patients and after 3 years in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Margins at hepatectomy, recurrence pattern, resected recurrence, and disease-free interval from time of colectomy to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> and from time of hepatectomy to recurrence were independently associated with survival as measured from the time of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrence in the lung, resected recurrence, and time to recurrence after hepatectomy were associated with prolonged survival as measured from the time of hepatectomy and the time of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The timing and pattern of recurrence after hepatic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> are important predictors of long-term survival </plain></SENT>
