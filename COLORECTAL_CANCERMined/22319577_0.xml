<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recruitment of activated effector lymphocytes to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is important for efficient anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses, while the presence of regulatory T cells (Treg) down-modulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore aimed to determine homing mechanisms and activation stage of Treg and effector T cell infiltrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> compared to cells from the unaffected mucosa in patients suffering from <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Lymphocytes were isolated from unaffected and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mucosa from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative PCR was used to investigate the homing mechanisms and activation stage of infiltrating Treg and conventional lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected significantly higher frequencies of CD25(high)FOXP3⁺CD127(low) putative Treg in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than unaffected mucosa, which had a complete demethylation in the FOXP3 promotor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>-associated Treg had a high expression of CTLA-4, and some appeared to be antigen experienced effector/memory cells based on their expression of αEβ7 (CD103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were also significantly fewer activated T cells and more CTLA-4⁺ conventional T cells susceptible to immune regulation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CD8⁺granzyme B⁺ putative cytotoxic cells were efficiently recruited to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of cells expressing α4β7 and the Th1 associated chemokine receptor CXCR3 were significantly decreased among CD4⁺ T cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, while frequencies of CD4⁺CCR4⁺ lymphocytes were significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that CCR4⁺CTLA4(hi) Treg accumulate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e>, while the frequencies of activated conventional Th1 type T cells are decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The altered lymphocyte composition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> will probably diminish the ability of the immune system to effectively attack <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, and reducing the Treg activity is an important challenge for future immunotherapy protocols </plain></SENT>
