<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the function of the circadian clock during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e>, the daily profiles of the core clock genes Per1, Per2, Rev-Erbα and Bmal1, the clock-controlled gene Dbp and the clock-controlled cell cycle genes Wee1, c-Myc and p21 were detected by real-time RT-PCR in chemically induced primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, the surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue and in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The circadian rhythmicity of Per1, Per2, Rev-Erbα and Dbp was significantly reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> compared with healthy colon and the rhythmicity of Bmal1 was completely abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the circadian expression of Per1, Per2, Rev-Erbα and Dbp persisted in the colonic tissue surrounding the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> but the rhythmic expression of Bmal1 was also abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily profiles of Wee1, c-Myc and p21 did not exhibit any rhythmicity either in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> or in the colon of healthy animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absence of diurnal rhythmicity of cell cycle genes was partially associated with ageing, because young healthy mice showed rhythmicity in the core clock genes as well as in the Wee1 and p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the liver of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice the clock gene rhythms were temporally shifted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the circadian regulation is distorted in colonic neoplastic tissue and that the gene-specific disruption may be also observed in the non-neoplastic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings reinforce the role of peripheral circadian clockwork disruption for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
