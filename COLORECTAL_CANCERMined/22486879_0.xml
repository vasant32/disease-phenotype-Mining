<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The incidence of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> is increasing and they are risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the carcinogenic significance of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6983267 at 8q24, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between the SNP genotype and genes associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> was investigated in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 107 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed in eight institutes from 2003 to 2008, array-CGH and cDNA microarray was performed and the data analyzed from two groups subdivided according to SNP genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the array-CGH data, we selected 38 genes related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or fat metabolism, and of these 10 had a correlation coefficient between the genome copy number at 8q24 locus and that of each gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 genes, insulin growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) was the only one with an expression level significantly associated with the 8q24 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IGF2R expression was significantly lower in non-risk allele than in risk allele cases (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was neither a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>- nor a fat metabolism-related gene that was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases with the risk allele at 8q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SNP at 8q24 makes <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> a risk factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> via IGF2R, especially in genetically non-risk allele cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the risk allele of 8q24 might be risky enough that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is not necessary to worsen the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
