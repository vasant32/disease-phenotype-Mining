<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to more precisely estimate the effect of FS-based screening on the incidence and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by performing a meta-analysis of published RCTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medline and Embase databases were searched for eligible articles published between 1966 and 28 May 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After screening 3,319 citations and 29 potentially relevant articles, two reviewers identified five RCTs evaluating the effect of FS screening on the incidence and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reviewers independently extracted relevant data; discrepancies were resolved by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The quality of included studies was assessed using criteria set out by the Evidence-Based Gastroenterology Steering Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Random effects meta-analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The five RCTs meeting eligibility criteria were determined to be of high methodologic quality and enrolled 416,159 total subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four European studies compared FS to no screening and one study from the United States compared FS to usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By intention to treat analysis, FS-based screening was associated with an 18% relative risk reduction in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.91, p&lt;0.001, number needed to screen [NNS] to prevent one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> = 361), a 33% reduction in the incidence of left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.59-0.76, p&lt;0.001, NNS = 332), and a 28% reduction in the mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (relative risk [RR] 0.72, 95% CI 0.65-0.80, p&lt;0.001, NNS = 850) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The efficacy estimate, the amount of benefit for those who actually adhered to the recommended treatment, suggested that FS screening reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence by 32% (p&lt;0.001), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related mortality by 50% (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Limitations of this meta-analysis include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the design of the included trials, absence of studies from Africa, Asia, or South America, and lack of studies comparing FS with colonoscopy or stool-based testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrates that FS-based screening significantly reduces the incidence and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in average-risk patients </plain></SENT>
