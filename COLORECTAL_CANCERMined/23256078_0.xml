<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medical imaging offers useful information on patients' medical conditions and on the causes of their symptoms and diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As imaging technologies advance, a large number of medical images are produced which physicians/radiologists must interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, computer <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> are demanded and become indispensable in physicians' decision making based on medical images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) has been investigated and has been an active research area in medical imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAD is defined as detection and/or diagnosis made by a radiologist/physician who takes into account the computer output as a "second opinion" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In CAD research, detection and diagnosis of lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in thoracic and colonic imaging constitute major areas, because lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are the leading and second leading causes, respectively, of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the U.S. and also in other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, CAD of the thorax and colon, including CAD for detection and diagnosis of lung nodules in thoracic CT, and that for detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in CT colonography, are reviewed </plain></SENT>
