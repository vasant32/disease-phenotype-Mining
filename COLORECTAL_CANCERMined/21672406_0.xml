<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Recent studies indicate an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may have lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates than people without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few data are available regarding factors associated with lack of screening for people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to describe factors associated with lack of timely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined an electronic medical record database with more than 6,000 patients aged 50 years or older who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and were seen in a large hospital system in Boston, Massachusetts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared patients who had received timely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening with those who had not on several variables, including glycemic control, expressed as average <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bivariate analyses were performed using Ï‡(2) and t tests for means when applicable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to determine the independent association of variables with lack of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with poor glycemic control (average HbA1c &gt;8.5%) were more likely not to have been screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> than those with good glycemic control, even after adjusting for the number of primary care visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with fewer than 20 primary care visits in 5 years were more likely not to have been screened than those with more visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Glycemic control appears to be independently associated with the likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>People with poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should be targeted in future research and individual patient care </plain></SENT>
