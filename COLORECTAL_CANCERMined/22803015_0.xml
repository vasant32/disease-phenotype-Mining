<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening guidelines recommend that first-time screening should occur at 50 years of age for average-risk individuals and at 40 years of age for those with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether persons with a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> family history were achieving screening at 40 years of age and whether average-risk persons were achieving screening at 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study was a cross-sectional analysis of subjects who entered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening program and were undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 778 individuals were enrolled in the present study: 340 (174 males) with no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and 438 (189 males) with a positive family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the group with a positive family history, the mean (± SD) age for primary screening was 54.4 ± 8.5 years, compared with 58.2 ± 6.4 years for the group with no family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On average, those with a positive family history initiated screening 3.8 years (95% CI 2.8 to 4.8; P&lt;0.05) earlier than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate for the positive family history group was 20.8% (n=91) compared with 23.5 % (n=80) for the group with no family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> family history are initiating screening approximately four years earlier than those without a family history; nevertheless, both groups are undergoing screening well past current guideline recommendations </plain></SENT>
