<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The preventive role of non-steroid <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) and aspirin, in particular, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, it has been suggested that aspirin may also have a therapeutic role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim of the present observational population-based study was to assess the therapeutic effect on overall survival of aspirin/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> as adjuvant treatment used after the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data concerning prescriptions were obtained from PHARMO record linkage systems and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (1998-2007) were selected from the Eindhoven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aspirin/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use was classified as none, prediagnosis and postdiagnosis and only postdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were defined as non-user of aspirin/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> from the date of diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to the date of first use of aspirin or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> and user from first use to the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poisson regression was performed with user status as time-varying exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1176 (26%) patients were non-users, 2086 (47%) were prediagnosis and postdiagnosis users and 1219 (27%) were only postdiagnosis users (total n=4481) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-users, a survival gain was observed for aspirin users; the adjusted rate ratio (RR) was 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.95; P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratified for colon and rectal, the survival gain was only present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (adjusted RR 0.65 (95%CI 0.50-0.84; P=0.001)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For frequent users survival gain was larger (adjusted RR 0.61 (95%CI 0.46-0.81; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, aspirin use was not associated with survival (adjusted RR 1.10 (95%CI 0.79-1.54; P=0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> use was associated with decreased survival (adjusted RR 1.93 (95%CI 1.70-2.20; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aspirin use initiated or continued after diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> is associated with a lower risk of overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly support initiation of a placebo-controlled trial that investigates the role of aspirin as adjuvant treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
