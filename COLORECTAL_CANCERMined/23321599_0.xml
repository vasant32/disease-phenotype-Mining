<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Importantly, periconceptual nutritional influences may modulate the establishment of epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation at MEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on these characteristics, we exploited Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip kits in a 2-tissue parallel screen on peripheral blood leukocyte and colonic mucosal DNA from 10 children without identifiable large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This approach led to the delineation of 1776 CpG sites meeting our criteria for MEs, which associated with 1013 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The list of ME candidates exhibited overlaps with recently identified human genes (including CYP2E1 and MGMT, where methylation has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo>, respectively) in which perinatal DNA methylation levels where linked to maternal periconceptual nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred 18 (11.6%) of the ME candidates overlapped with genes where DNA methylation correlated (r &gt; 0.871; p &lt; 0.055) with expression in the colon mucosa of 5 independent control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in homophilic cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (including cadherin-associated genes) and developmental processes were significantly overrepresented in association with MEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional filtering of gene expression-correlated MEs defined 35 genes, associated with 2 or more CpG sites within a 10 kb genomic region, fulfilling the ME criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation changes at a number of these genes have been linked to various forms of human disease, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (ALOX12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (EBF3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (NAV1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (KCNK15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> (protocadherin gene cluster; PCDHAs) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (TCERG1L), suggesting a potential etiologic role for MEs in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and underscoring the possible developmental origins of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
