<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess outcomes in patients who underwent hepatic resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) with subcentimetre indeterminate pulmonary nodules (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi>) and to devise a management pathway for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing CRLM resection from January 2006 to December 2010 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival differences following liver resection in patients with and without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 184 patients were included, 30 of whom had <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> groups in terms of demographics, surgery and pathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between patients with and without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> with respect to disease-free (P= 0.190) and overall (P= 0.710) survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> progressed to metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> over a median period of 10 months (range: 3-18 months); six of these patients underwent lung resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 15 patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi>, eight showed no <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> progression and subsequent CT scans did not identify <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> in the remaining seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> who have resectable disease should be treated with liver resection and should be subject to intensive surveillance post-resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although 50% of these patients will progress to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e>, this does not appear to influence survival following liver resection </plain></SENT>
