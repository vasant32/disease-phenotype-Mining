<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Combined targeting of MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways may be necessary for optimal therapeutic activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the MEK inhibitors AZD6244 and PD0325901, alone and in combination with the dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 or the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941, in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Growth inhibition, survival and signal transduction were measured using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52101">Sulforhodamine B</z:chebi> assay, clonogenicity and western blotting, respectively, in HCT116, HT29 and DLD1 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> MEK/PI3K inhibitor combinations exhibited marked synergistic growth inhibition; however, GDC-0941 displayed greater synergy in combination with either MEK inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NVP-BEZ235 exhibited stronger inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation, and similar inhibition of S6 and AKT phosphorylation, compared with GDC-0941 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both PD0325901 and AZD6244 inhibited ERK phosphorylation, and with MEK/PI3K inhibitor combinations inhibition of S6 phosphorylation was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduced synergy exhibited by NVP-BEZ235 in combination with MEK inhibitors, compared with GDC-0941, may be due to inhibition of mTOR, and the addition of the mTORC1/2 inhibitor KU0063794 compromised the synergy of GDC-0941:PD0325901 combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These studies confirm that dual targeting of PI3K and MEK can induce synergistic growth inhibition; however, the combination of specific PI3K inhibitors, rather than dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitors, with MEK inhibitors results in greater synergy </plain></SENT>
