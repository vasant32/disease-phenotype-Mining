<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, thousands of high-confidence TCF4 binding sites were reported in LS174T colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells, however, potential TCF4 target miRNAs remain largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we utilized a bioinformatics approach to discover 26 miRNA transcription start sites (TSSs) within close proximity to TCF4 chromatin occupancy sites, and validated these sites as bona fide TCF4 targets in LS174T colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells, MCF-7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells and U87 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells by ChIP-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then selected miR-21 to demonstrate for the first time direct TCF4 transcriptional activation of a miRNA via binding to the promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue array analysis supported this finding, revealing a positive correlation between activation of the β-catenin pathway and in situ expression of miR-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, based upon the well known but poorly understood preventive effect of aspirin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality, we report downregulation of miR-21 upon administration of aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In sum, our findings identify direct transcriptional regulation of miR-21 by TCF4 and suggest a role for miR-21 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell proliferation and invasion upon activation of β-catenin/TCF4 signaling </plain></SENT>
