<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An article in a recent edition of Current <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> explored the validation of progression-free survival (pfs) as an endpoint in clinical trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic agents</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The support for pfs as a surrogate endpoint for overall survival (os) was elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As with the aforementioned <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types, advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> (nsclc) has seen a rise in active agents since the year 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those agents range from improved cytotoxics such as pemetrexed, to targeted therapies such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> of the epidermal growth factor receptor and agents that target the EML4-ALK gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More recently, it has also become apparent that histology plays an important role in the response to and outcomes of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the therapeutic options for patients with advanced nsclc increasing, concerns are being raised that the efficacy of drugs measured by os may be diluted in clinical trials, thereby underestimating their true clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That possibility, together with the need to have efficacious drugs available to patients earlier, has resulted in the search for a surrogate to the os endpoint in advanced nsclc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present article follows up the recent article on pfs as a surrogate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although advances in identifying pfs as a valid surrogate endpoint for os have been made in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types, in advanced nsclc, such surrogacy has not been formally validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Until it has, os should remain the primary endpoint of clinical trials in advanced nsclc </plain></SENT>
