<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to compare the use of two prophylactic antibiotic (PA) regimens as regards efficacy, timing, and cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients with gastric, bladder, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomized to receive preoperative PA, group A received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51765">penicillin G sodium</z:chebi> and gentamicin and group B received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3745">clindamycin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2637">amikacin</z:chebi> intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The demographic data of patients were collected, and they were observed for wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Infected wounds occurred in 19 patients with a rate of 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Highest incidence of SSI was among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> patients (14.2%); p=0.044 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of SSI was 11% in group A, and 8% in group B, p=0.469 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cost of PA administered in group A was significantly less than that of group B (21.96±3.22LE versus 117.05±12.74LE, respectively; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SSI tended to be higher among those who had longer time for antibiotic and incision (⩾30min) than those who had shorter time interval (&lt;30min), (13% vs. 6.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi>+gentamicin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3745">clindamycin</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2637">amikacin</z:chebi> are safe and effective for the prevention of SSI in clean contaminated operative procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a resource limited hospital, a regimen including <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi>+gentamicin is a cost-effective alternative for the more expensive and broader coverage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3745">clindamycin</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2637">amikacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Timing of PA is effective in preventing SSIs when administered 30min before the start of surgery </plain></SENT>
