<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we consider the case in which specimens are combined for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a pool-wise exposure, in lieu of assessing the actual binary exposure status for each member of the pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We presume a primary logistic regression model for an observed binary outcome, together with a secondary regression model for exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We facilitate maximum likelihood analysis by complete enumeration of the possible implications of a positive pool, and we discuss the applicability of this approach under both cross-sectional and case-control sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also provide a maximum likelihood approach for longitudinal or repeated measures studies where the binary outcome and exposure are assessed on multiple occasions and within-subject pooling is conducted for exposure assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simulation studies illustrate the performance of the proposed approaches along with their computational feasibility using widely available software </plain></SENT>
