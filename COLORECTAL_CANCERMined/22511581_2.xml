<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether adipokines are risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and whether they may mediate its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a case-cohort study nested within the Women's Health Initiative cohort of postmenopausal women, baseline plasma samples from 457 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 841 subcohort subjects were assayed for seven adipokines-adiponectin, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), resistin, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-Î± </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> values measured previously were also available for data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, race, smoking, colonoscopy history, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> level, a low level of anti-inflammatory adiponectin and high levels of proinflammatory leptin, PAI-1, and IL-6 were associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, though only leptin remained significant after further adjustment for insulin [HRs comparing extreme quartiles (HR(Q4-Q1)), 1.84; 95% CI, 1.17-2.90] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mediation analyses showed that leptin and insulin partially explained the association between waist circumference and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and attenuated it by 25% and 37%, respectively, with insulin being a significant mediator (P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the conclusion that adipokines involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, but that their effects may be mediated mostly by insulin, with leptin exerting an independent effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>Hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and hyperleptinemia may therefore partially explain the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
