<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical data and surgical frozen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues were retrospectively collected from 125 stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, which contained 60 patients who relapsed and 65 patients who did not relapse within 3 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of miR-215 was determined by real-time PCR, and the relationship between miR-215 expression and the relapse was analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>miR-215 was downregulated in relapsed patients compared to nonrelapsed patients (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The low expression of miR-215 was significantly correlated with a high probability of 3-year relapse (P = 0.001), which was more obvious in stage III patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis showed that miR-215 expression could function as an independent predictive marker for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It seemed that patients with high expressions of miR-215 could benefit from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-containing adjuvant chemotherapy without significant difference, whereas this phenomenon was reverse in patients with low expressions of miR-215 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study highlighted for the first time that miR-215 could function as a potential predictive marker for relapse following radical surgery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and the possible correlation between miR-215 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-containing adjuvant chemotherapy would be validated in the future </plain></SENT>
