<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched PubMed and Embase until May 2012 to identify eligible studies, extracted data, assessed methodological quality, and performed statistical analysis using REVMAN 5.1 and R software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subgroups meta-analyses were performed in groups representing different IRI combination regimens and IRI doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen trials were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype was associated with more than fourfold (odds ratio (OR)=4.79, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 3.28-7.01; P&lt;0.00001) and threefold (OR=3.44, 95% CI: 2.45-4.82; P&lt;0.00001) increases in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> when compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and with at least one UGT1A1*1 allele, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1*1/*28 genotype had an OR of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.44-2.51; P&lt;0.00001) for an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A twofold increase in risk of diarrhoea was associated with UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype (OR=1.84, 95% CI: 1.24-2.72; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subgroup meta-analysis, the higher incidence of diarrhoea in UGT1A1*28/*28 patients was limited to studies where when IRI was given at higher doses (OR=2.37, 95% CI: 1.39-4.04; P=0.002) or combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (FU or analogue) (OR=1.78, 95% CI: 1.16-2.75; P=0.009) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IRI-combined 5-FU (or analogue) and a high-dose IRI therapy enhance IRI-induced diarrhoea among patients bearing the UGT1A1*28 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the toxicity relationships were much stronger with the UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant, associations were also found with the UGT1A1*28 heterozygous variant.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 26 March 2013; doi:10.1038/tpj.2013.10 </plain></SENT>
