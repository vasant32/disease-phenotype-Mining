<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Primary care physician (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) actions are pivotal to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening performance, and guidelines recommend discussion with patients about test options and potential benefits and harms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article profiles patterns of discussion about and recommendations for screening and explores potential associations with multilevel factors (patient, clinician, practice, and environment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2009, we analyzed data from 1,266 physicians responding to the 2006-2007 National Survey of Primary Care Physicians' Recommendations and Practices for Breast, Cervical, Colorectal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lung Cancer</z:e> Screening (absolute response rate=69.3%; cooperation rate=75.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics examined physicians' reports of discussion and recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses assessed the associations of these practices with multilevel factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although few respondents reported discussion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> options, 46% usually discuss more than one option; the vast majority of these respondents discuss fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and colonoscopy (49%) or FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of physicians who discuss more than one option, a majority reported usually recommending one or more test options, most commonly colonoscopy alone (43%) and FOBT and colonoscopy (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several personal characteristics (specialty), perceived patient characteristics (prefer physician to decide), practice characteristics (geographic location), and community barriers (specialist availability) were independently associated with discussion and/or recommendation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> do not discuss the full menu of test options, but many report selecting one or two options for discussion and recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To ensure that patients' perspectives and concerns are elicited and considered, patient decision-making approaches should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Attention to informed decision making in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening will be important for enhancing patient-centered quality care </plain></SENT>
