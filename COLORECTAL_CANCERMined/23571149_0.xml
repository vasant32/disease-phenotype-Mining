<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening generally remains sub-optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine factors influencing the decision whether to participate or not among individuals invited for faecal occult blood test (FOBT) or flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to a stratified random sample of individuals aged 50-74, previously invited for a randomised <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening trial offering FOBT or FS, and a reference group from the same population not previously invited (screening naïve group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire assessed reasons for (non)-participation, individuals' characteristics associated with participation, knowledge, attitudes and level of informed choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 75% (n=341/452) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening participants, 21% (n=676/3212) for non-participants and 38% (n=192/500) for screening-naïve individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main reasons for FOBT and FS participation were acquiring certainty about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> presence and possible early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anticipated regret and positive attitudes towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were strong predictors of actual participation and intention to participate in a next round </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main reason for non-participation in FOBT screening was lack of abdominal complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Non-participation in FS screening was additionally influenced by worries about burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent of participants and 12% of non-participants made an informed choice on participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Only 12% of non-participants made an informed choice not to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results imply that governments and/or organizations offering screening should focus on adequately informing and educating target populations about the harms and benefits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may impact uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
