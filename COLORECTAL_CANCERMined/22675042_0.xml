<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells are important for the induction of an antitumor immune response; however <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are capable of disabling dendritic cells and escaping immune surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the numbers of CD11c+ cells infiltrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue and to examine the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> conditioned media (TCM) and bevacizumab conditioned media (BCM) on dendritic cell maturation and correlate our findings with patient survival. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> explant tissues were cultured with or without bevacizumab, to generate BCM and TCM, which were used to treat dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD80, CD86, CD83, CD54, HLA-DR, and CD1d expression was measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12p70 were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to associate survival with dendritic cell inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCM and BCM inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced dendritic cell maturation and IL-12p70 secretion (P &lt; 0.0001), while increasing IL-10 secretion (P = 0.0033 and 0.0220, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of LPS-induced CD1d (P = 0.021, HR = 1.096) and CD83 (P = 0.017, HR = 1.083) by TCM and inhibition of CD1d (P = 0.017, HR = 1.067), CD83 (P = 0.032, HR = 1.035), and IL-12p70 (P = 0.037, HR = 1.036) by BCM was associated with poor survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD11c expression was elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue (P &lt; 0.001), but this did not correlate with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TCM and BCM inhibit dendritic cells, and this inhibition correlates with survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients receiving bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
