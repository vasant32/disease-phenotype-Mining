<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded archival specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were included randomly as cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess EGFR expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with the clinicopathological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than 1% of membranous EGFR expression was found in 24 (48%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactions intensity was classified as weak, moderate and strong representing 2, 22 and 24%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate analysis, EGFR expression was not significantly associated with age, sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, stage, grade and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the assessment of EGFR expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by conventional immunohistochemistry has not proven its predictive value and can not be useful to predict about outcome of patients </plain></SENT>
