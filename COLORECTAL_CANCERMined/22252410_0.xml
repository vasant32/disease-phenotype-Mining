<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: If effective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening is more common in people with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the relationship between family history and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence may become distorted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess the impact of screening on the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> family history and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we developed a model to simulate screening patterns in those with and without a family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The introduction of screening reduces the apparent risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with family history in subsequent generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This reduction becomes more pronounced as the difference in the uptake of screening between those with a family history and those without becomes larger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A result of effective screening is that observed family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may no longer match inherited risk, and observed family history may fail to be a strong risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may have implications for exposure-disease relationships if screening is differentially associated with the exposure </plain></SENT>
