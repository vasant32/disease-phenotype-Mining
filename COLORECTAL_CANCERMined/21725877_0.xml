<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, to provide experimental evidence for the Chinese medicinal theory of "strengthening the body's resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors" in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, including its invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First, CWQ sera were prepared with serum-pharmacology methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, the modified hypoxic chamber was designed and flushed with 5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> and 95% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17997">N(2)</z:chebi> at 37 °C to induce a hypoxic environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of CWQ serum on the viability of LoVo cells was tested with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> cytotoxicity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The wound model and chamber model were established to estimate the effects of CWQ serum on migration and invasion of LoVo cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The model for cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> was established to evaluate the effect of CWQ serum on LoVo cells' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gelatin zymography model was performed to determine the effects of CWQ serum on the activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects of CWQ serum on the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor 1 α (HIF-1α) nuclear translocation and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in LoVo cells were determined by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CWQ inhibited LoVo cells' migration based on wound healing assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inhibitive effect could reach about 68.00% under hypoxic culture and about 29.87% under normoxic culture when cells were treated with 10% CWQ serum for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results from both cell invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> assays showed that CWQ serum could dose-dependently repress the invasion of LoVo cells and inhibit cells from adhering to extra cellular matrix (ECM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Under the hypoxic culture condition, RT-PCR analysis showed that 10% CWQ serum had down-regulated the expression of VEGF by 45.87%, and the result of Western blot analysis provided further evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The HIF-1α amount in the nucleus of the LoVo cells was also diminished in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by the Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Gel zymogram assay revealed that CWQ serum could suppress the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CWQ could effectively inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor metastasis</z:e> in vitro The antimetastatic effects of CWQ were associated with the inhibition of cell motility, which was evidenced by inhibition of cell invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion by CWQ were due to the reduced expression of both HIF-1α and VEGF and the suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression </plain></SENT>
