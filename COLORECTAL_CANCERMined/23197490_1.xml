<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 2009, the American Society of Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> recommended that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) who are candidates for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy have their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> tested for KRAS mutations because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with such mutations do not respond to anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limiting anti-EGFR therapy to those without KRAS mutations will reserve treatment for those likely to benefit while avoiding unnecessary costs and harm to those who would not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with BRAF genetic mutations may not respond to anti-EGFR therapy, though this is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Economic analyses of mutation testing have not fully explored the roles of alternative therapies and resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This paper is based on a decision analytic framework that forms the basis of a cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for KRAS and BRAF mutations in mCRC in the context of treatment with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 50 000 patients with mCRC is simulated 10 000 times, with attributes randomly assigned on the basis of distributions from randomized controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Screening for both KRAS and BRAF mutations compared with the base strategy (of no anti-EGFR therapy) increases expected overall survival by 0.034 years at a cost of $22 033, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately $650 000 per additional year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with anti-EGFR therapy without screening, adding KRAS testing saves approximately $7500 per patient; adding BRAF testing saves another $1023, with little reduction in expected survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening for KRAS and BFAF mutation improves the cost-effectiveness of anti-EGFR therapy, but the incremental cost effectiveness ratio remains above the generally accepted threshold for acceptable cost effectiveness ratio of $100 000/quality adjusted life year </plain></SENT>
