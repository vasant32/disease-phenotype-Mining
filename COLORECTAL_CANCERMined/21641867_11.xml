<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maximisation of time without toxic effects could be one effective strategy to achieve both of these goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The COIN trial assessed preplanned treatment holidays in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to achieve this aim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: COIN was a randomised controlled trial in patients with previously untreated advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received either continuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and fluoropyrimidine combination (arm A), continuous chemotherapy plus cetuximab (arm B), or intermittent (arm C) chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In arms A and B, treatment continued until development of progressive disease, cumulative toxic effects, or the patient chose to stop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In arm C, patients who had not progressed at their 12-week scan started a chemotherapy-free interval until evidence of disease progression, when the same treatment was restarted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was done centrally (via telephone) by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit using minimisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment allocation was not masked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comparison of arms A and B is described in a companion paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here, we compare arms A and C, with the primary objective of establishing whether overall survival on intermittent therapy was non-inferior to that on continuous therapy, with a predefined non-inferiority boundary of 1.162 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered, ISRCTN27286448 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 1630 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (815 to continuous and 815 to intermittent therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median survival in the ITT population (n=815 in both groups) was 15.8 months (IQR 9.4-26.1) in arm A and 14.4 months (8.0-24.7) in arm C (hazard ratio [HR] 1.084, 80% CI 1.008-1.165) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the per-protocol population (arm A, n=467; arm C, n=511), median survival was 19.6 months (13.0-28.1) in arm A and 18.0 months (12.1-29.3) in arm C (HR 1.087, 0.986-1.198) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The upper limits of CIs for HRs in both analyses were greater than the predefined non-inferiority boundary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Preplanned subgroup analyses in the per-protocol population showed that a raised baseline platelet count, defined as 400,000 per Î¼L or higher (271 [28%] of 978 patients), was associated with poor survival with intermittent chemotherapy: the HR for comparison of arm C and arm A in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet count was 0.96 (95% CI 0.80-1.15, p=0.66), versus 1.54 (1.17-2.03, p=0.0018) in patients with a raised platelet count (p=0.0027 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the per-protocol population, more patients on continuous than on intermittent treatment had grade 3 or worse haematological toxic effects (72 [15%] vs 60 [12%]), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> were more common on intermittent treatment (11 [2%] vs 43 [8%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (126 [27%] vs 25 [5%]) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e> (21 [4%] vs 15 [3%]) were more frequent on continuous than on intermittent treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Although this trial did not show non-inferiority of intermittent compared with continuous chemotherapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in terms of overall survival, chemotherapy-free intervals remain a treatment option for some patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, offering reduced time on chemotherapy, reduced cumulative toxic effects, and improved quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses suggest that patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> baseline platelet counts could gain the benefits of intermittent chemotherapy without detriment in survival, whereas those with raised baseline platelet counts have impaired survival and quality of life with intermittent chemotherapy and should not receive a treatment break </plain></SENT>
