<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with a minimum of 15-year follow-up after antigen-directed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery was performed to assess the impact of complete surgical resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detectable radiolabeled anti-TAG-72 muMAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Survival analysis was performed on 92 patients (study group) with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (July 1990 to August 1995) treated with antigen-directed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery using (125)I-labeled anti-TAG-72 muMAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study group was subdivided into those with no detectable TAG-72 antigen-bearing tissues (TAG-72 negative, N=33) and those with persistent detectable TAG-72 antigen-bearing tissues (TAG-72 positive, N=59) at completion of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with a control group (546 patients) from the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Study group and control group were demographically similar, as were TAG-72-negative subgroup and TAG-72-positive subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TAG-72-negative subgroup had significantly improved median survival (8.8 versus 2.5 years; P=0.005) and time-dependent survival (45.4% versus 22.0% at 10 years; P=0.002 and 39.4% versus 20.3% at 15 years; P=0.003) compared with TAG-72-positive subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TAG-72 positivity was as an independent predictor of long-term mortality risk, when controlled for pathologic stage of disease </plain></SENT>
