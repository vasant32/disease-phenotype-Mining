<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this research study are to describe the proportion of Medicaid-insured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors who had a colonoscopy between 3 and 18 months after surgery of the colon or rectum and to determine if patient, health services, and community characteristics are associated with colonoscopy follow-up after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study among 1044 Medicaid-insured individuals diagnosed with local or regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed patient, hospital, and community characteristics associated with colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: About 42% of the study population had a colonoscopy 3 to 18 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with receipt of colonoscopy in the multivariable model include having colon (vs rectal) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, having local (vs regional) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and having received chemotherapy as part of first course of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Being 75 or older (vs &lt;65), having first course of therapy at a hospital with the highest surgical volume (vs lowest surgical volume), and living in an urban (vs rural) environment were associated with a decreased likelihood of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy utilization patterns diverge after 65 years of age when persons become dually insured by Medicare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By age 80 years, there seems to be an almost 3-fold difference in receipt of colonoscopy-those with comorbidity are more likely to be screened than those without comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Less than half of Medicaid-insured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors received a colonoscopy in 3 to 18 months after colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvements in screening in this high-risk population should be the target of future interventions to reduce the probability of recurrence </plain></SENT>
