<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Growth was assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assays after exposure of HCT-116 cells to Herceptin, anti-CD3 and BsAb antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry was applied to test the HER-2 level of HCT-116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse model, HER-2 CD3 BsAb was combined with effector cells (peripheral blood lymph cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human being) for observations on in Vivo growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, using effector cells combined with anti-CD3 McAb, Herceptin or HER2 CD3 BsAb, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell growth in vitro and in vivo was significantly inhibited (P&lt;0.05), most remarkably in the HER2 CD3 BsAb case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The growth of xenografts with HER2 CD3 BsAb combined with effector cells was also significantly inhibited when compared with the anti-CD3 McAb or Herceptin groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HER-2/neu might be a useful target for immunotherapy in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, anti-HER2 anti-CD3 BsAb exerting clear anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effects </plain></SENT>
