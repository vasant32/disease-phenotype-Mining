<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated improved survival from diagnosis but not increased life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While lead-time bias may account for variations in known prognostic indicators and also influence screening programmes, only age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> provides a true representation of the effectiveness of an intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> presenting on an emergency or elective basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (2000-2006) were entered into a prospective database (analysis 1 December 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fields included age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, emergency/elective presentation, palliative/curative intent and disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One thousand six hundred and fifty patients (922 men) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elective patients presented younger than emergency patients (67.9 vs 70.6 years; P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dukes B patients presented older than Dukes D (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 41% at time of analysis; no difference was seen in mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> between emergency and elective presentation (72.8 vs 72.0 years; P = 0.379) or palliative and curative intent (72.0 vs 72.5 years; P = 0.604) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is common in a population where actuarial life expectancy is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> early detection strategies may improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival by increasing lead-time bias but do not influence overall life expectancy </plain></SENT>
