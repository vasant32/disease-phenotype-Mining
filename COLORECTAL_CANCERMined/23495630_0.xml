<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to ascertain the determinants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> racial-ethnic survival disparities in a state of the Mountain West region, Nevada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of a cohort of 12,181 men and women with a first primary invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the colon and rectum diagnosed between 1995 and 2007, identified through the Nevada Central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and followed for vital status until 31 December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Likelihood ratio chi-square statistics were used to compare the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics for race-ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional regression modeling and partial likelihood tests were used to estimate the hazard ratios and assess interaction effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cause-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to be diagnosed with distant stage disease, 22.4% and 21.5% respectively, compared to 17.9% in Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between racial-ethnic groups for diagnoses in regional stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis yielded a 20.1% higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for Blacks compared to Whites [95% CI = 1.05-1.37] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, sex, age, diagnosis period, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sublocation, marital status, and economic status in the multivariate model showed a persistently increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for Blacks (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.02-1.33) in relation to Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Survival disparities persisted among Blacks in our study even after adjusting for common demographic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further determinants of survival disparities between race/ethnicities, such as course of treatment, should be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, more public health intervention programs should tailor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening awareness towards minorities as well as ensuring equal access to health care and quality treatment </plain></SENT>
