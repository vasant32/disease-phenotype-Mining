<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Logistic regressions were conducted using data collected in 2006 from 1,533 elderly women aged 60 years or above who had completed a screening instrument, the Minimum Data Set-Home Care, while applying for long-term care services at the first time in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The participation rates for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among frail older Chinese women were 3.7% and 10.8% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive status was inversely associated with the likelihood of participation in screening (breast: OR = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.47-0.94; colon: OR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.66-0.99), as was educational level with the likelihood of participation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening (no formal education: OR = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.06-0.61, some primary education: OR = 0.31, 95%CI = 0.10-1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The delivery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> preventive health services to frail older women is less than ideal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive status and educational level were important factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tailor-made strategic promotion programmes targeting older women with low cognitive status and educational levels are needed to enhance awareness and acceptance within this vulnerable group </plain></SENT>
