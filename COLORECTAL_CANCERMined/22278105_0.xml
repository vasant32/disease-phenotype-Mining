<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a useful therapeutic technique for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> larger than 20 mm, the chance of piecemeal resection is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently introduced endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) enables en bloc resection regardless of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and outcomes of EMR, EMR-precutting (EMR-P), and ESD in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> 20 mm in size or larger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study reviewed 523 nonpedunculated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> (499 patients) 20 mm or larger that received endoscopic treatment (EMR in 140 cases, EMR-P in 69 cases, and ESD in 314 cases) from January 2004 to November 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean sizes of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were 21.7 ± 3.5 mm (EMR), 23.5 ± 5.6 mm (EMR-P), and 28.9 ± 12.7 mm (ESD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratios of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were 15.7% (EMR), 29% (EMR-P), and 37.9% (ESD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The en bloc resection rates were 42.9% (EMR), 65.2% (EMR-P), and 92.7% (ESD), and the complete resection rates were 32.9% (EMR), 59.4% (EMR-P), and 87.6% (ESD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> occurred in 2.9% of the EMR-P cases and 8% of the ESD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rates were 25.9% (EMR; median follow-up period, 26 months), 3.2% (EMR-P; median follow-up period, 16 months), and 0.8% (ESD; median follow-up period, 17 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For the treatment of large, nonpedunculated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, ESD is more effective than either EMR or EMR-P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although ESD is technically demanding, it has clinical significance by overcoming the limitations of both EMR and EMR-P </plain></SENT>
