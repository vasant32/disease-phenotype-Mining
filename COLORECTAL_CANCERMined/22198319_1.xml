<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the effect of APN deficiency on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was achieved by inducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in both APN knockout (KO) and C57B1/6 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into four treatment groups (n=6): 1) control (no treatment); 2) treatment with three cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS); 3) weekly doses of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) (20mg/kg of mouse body weight) for twelve weeks; 4) a single dose of DMH followed by 3 cycles of DSS (DMH+DSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, stool hemoccult, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and were sacrificed on day 153 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> area and number were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colonic tissues were collected for Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APNKO mice were more protected than WT mice from DSS induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> during first DSS cycle, but lost this protection during the second and the third DSS cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>APNKO mice had significantly severe symptoms and showed greater number and larger area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with higher immune cell infiltration and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> than WT mice </plain></SENT>
