<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the possible role of miRNA-binding site polymorphisms located in five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes: IL-16, CDKN2A (p16), RAF1, PTGER4, and ITGB4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk modification in an Iranian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed on 643 individuals (249 CRC cases and 394 healthy controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes (IL-16, CDKN2A (p16), RAF1, PTGER4, and ITGB4) and investigated the genotypes of the 3' untranslated region miRNA-binding site polymorphisms in these genes in our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The restriction fragment length polymorphism results were confirmed by a direct sequencing method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a statistically significant difference between the rs1131445 polymorphism of the IL-16 gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the genotypes TT, CT, and CC in controls were 51%, 40.4%, and 8.6%, respectively, and in cases were 41.4%, 44.1%, and 14.5%, respectively, which shows a significant association between the CC genotype of the rs1131445 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the C allele in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> group was higher than in the controls, and the C allele of the rs1131445 polymorphism was found to be in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations remained significant after Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that the AA genotype of the rs743554 polymorphism in the ITGB4 gene and the T allele of the rs1051208 polymorphism of the RAF1 gene were associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in females; however, after Bonferroni's correction we found that they were non-significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, we can conclude that a significant relationship exists between the miRNA-binding site polymorphism of the IL-16 gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the Iranian population </plain></SENT>
