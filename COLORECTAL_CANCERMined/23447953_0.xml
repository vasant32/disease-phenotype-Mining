<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50595">Single walled carbon nanotubes</z:chebi> (SWCNTs) have distinctive physical and chemical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, innovative properties can be established to match the clinical need by attachment of functional groups to the SWCNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this experiment SWCNT was functionalized with OctaAmmonium-POSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that functionalization of SWCNT with OctaAmmonium-POSS would augment the dispersion of SWCNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further postulate that functionalization of SWCNT with OctaAmmonium-POSS would enhance the temperature increase of SWCNT upon exposure to NIR laser irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Functionalization of SWCNT was conferred by refluxing with acid and OctaAmmonium-POSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) test UV-visible spectroscopy and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> analysis using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirmed successful functionalization of SWCNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NIR irradiation of samples was conducted using an 808 nm laser at 1 watt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Temperature changes were documented using a thermal camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A HT-29 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell line was used as a model for photothermal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cell viability test was performed using trypan blue and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Graph plotting and statistical analysis was conducted using Graph Pad Prism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following the functionalization process, TEM images showed a layer on the surface of the SWCNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the FTIR experiment, results illustrated the presence of the -COOH group on the functionalized SWCNTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Upon further functionalization of SWCNT with OctaAmmonium-POSS, various peaks determined the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> bond between the POSS molecule and functionalized SWCNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The UV-visible spectra also determine the successful functionalization of the SWCNT following its treatment with acid and OctaAmmonium-POSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Upon exposure to NIR, OctaAmmonium-POSS-SWCNT was the only treatment group that illustrated significantly higher temperature increase than the other treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Additionally cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of NIR irradiated OctaAmmonium-POSS-SWCNT was statistically significant compared to other treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: OctaAmmonium-POSS was used to render SWCNT biocompatible and water dispersible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Observation from this study determines that functionalization with OctaAmmonium-POSS show greater temperature increase compared to pristine SWCNTs upon its exposure NIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This significant temperature increase is due to increasing the solubility of SWCNT following its functionalization with OctaAmmonium-POSS </plain></SENT>
