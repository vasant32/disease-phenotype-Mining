<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are used widely to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients, but it is now clear that patients harboring K-ras mutation are resistant to EGFR mAbs such as cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, current recommendations for patient care involve diagnosing the K-ras mutational status of patients prior to EGFR mAb therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the ability of two MEK inhibitors currently in clinical trials, AS703026 and AZD6244, to address the challenge posed by the resistance of K-ras mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> to EGFR mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AS703026 and AZD6244 were tested in various cell-based assays and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenograft studies, focusing on isogenic human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> cell lines that expressed only WT or mutant K-Ras (D-WT or D-MUT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EGFR mAb cetuximab inhibited the Ras-ERK pathway and proliferation of D-WT cells in vitro and in vivo, but it did not inhibit proliferation of D-MUT cells in either setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AS703026 and AZD6244 effectively inhibited the growth of D-MUT cells in vitro and in vivo by specific inhibition of the key MEK downstream target kinase ERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of MEK by AS703026 or AZD6244 also suppressed cetuximab-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells attributed to K-ras mutation both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings offer proof-of-concept for the use of MEK inhibitors as an effective therapy in K-ras mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
