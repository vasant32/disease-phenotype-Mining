<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the performance of eight metabolic indices for the early assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with advanced mCRC underwent two FDG PET/CT scans, at baseline and on day 14 after chemotherapy initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each lesion, eight metabolic indices were calculated: four standardized uptake values (SUV) without correction for the partial volume effect (PVE), two SUV with correction for PVE, a metabolic volume (MV) and a total lesion glycolysis (TLG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative change in each index between the two scans was calculated for each lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions were also classified as responding and nonresponding lesions using the Response Evaluation Criteria In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumours</z:e> (RECIST) 1.0 measured by contrast-enhanced CT at baseline and 6-8 weeks after starting therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bland-Altman analyses were performed to compare the various indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the RECIST classification, ROC analyses were used to determine how accurately the indices predicted lesion response to therapy later seen with RECIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RECIST showed 27 responding and 74 nonresponding lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bland-Altman analyses showed that the four SUV indices uncorrected for PVE could not be used interchangeably, nor could the two SUV corrected for PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were not significantly different between the SUV indices not corrected for PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean SUV change in a lesion better predicted lesion response without than with PVE correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The AUC was significantly higher for SUV uncorrected for PVE than for the MV, but change in MV provided some information regarding the lesion response to therapy (AUC &gt;0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In these mCRC patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SUV uncorrected for PVE accurately predicted the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response on day 14 after starting therapy as assessed 4 to 6 weeks later (i.e. 6 to 8 weeks after therapy initiation) using the RECIST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neither correcting SUV for PVE nor measuring TLG improved the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response compared to SUV uncorrected for PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The change in MV was the least accurate index for predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response </plain></SENT>
