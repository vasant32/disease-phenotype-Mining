Tausch led to the isolation of two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27418">naphthoquinones</z:chebi>, alkannin (1) and angelylalkannin (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative effects of the two compounds on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells HCT-116 and SW-480 were determined by the 3,4-(5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle profile and cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were determined using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both of the two compounds showed significant inhibitory effects on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For alkannin (1) and angelylalkannin (2), the median inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) values were 2.38 and 4.76 µM for HCT-116 cells, while for SW-480 cells they were 4.53 and 7.03 µM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potential antiproliferative mechanisms were also explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At concentrations between 1-10 µM, both compounds arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase and induced cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
