<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Screening colonoscopy (SC) outcome quality is best determined by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate (ADR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The substantial variability in the ADRs between endoscopists may reflect different skills, experience and/or equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse the potential factors that may influence ADR variance, including case volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: 12,134 consecutive SCs (mean age 64.5 years, 47% men) from 21 Berlin private-practice colonoscopists were prospectively studied during 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were analysed using a two-level mixed linear model to adequately address the characteristics of patients and colonoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ADR was regressed after considering the following factors: sex, age, bowel cleanliness, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> intake, annual SC case volume, lifetime experience, instrument withdrawal times, instrument generations used, and the number of annual continuing medical education (CME) meetings attended by the physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The case volume was also retrospectively analysed from the 2007 national SC registry data (312,903 colonoscopies and 1004 colonoscopists) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient factors that correlated with the ADR were sex, age (p&lt;0.001) and low quality of bowel preparation (p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The factors that were related to the colonoscopists were the number of CME meetings attended (p=0.012) and instrument generation (p=0.001); these factors accounted for approximately 40% of the interphysician variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within a narrow range (6-11 min), the withdrawal time was not correlated with the ADR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Annual screening case volume did not correlate with the ADR, and this finding was confirmed by the German registry data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The outcome quality of screening colonoscopies is mainly influenced by individual colonoscopist factors (ie, CME activities) and instrument quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinical Trial Gov Registration number: NCT00860665 </plain></SENT>
