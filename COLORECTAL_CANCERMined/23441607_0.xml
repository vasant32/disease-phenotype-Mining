<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-vitamins (i.e., <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, vitamin B(6) and B(12)) are involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism and play an important role as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzymes</z:chebi> in 1-carbon metabolism, which is thought to have a critical role in the progression of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of B-vitamins and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> on the risk of developing colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood was drawn from each participant to measure hematological parameters, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18405">pyridoxal 5'-phosphate</z:chebi> (PLP), serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12), and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants with AP and HP had significantly higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels than did healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) and plasma PLP among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-vitamins had no significant effect on the risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
