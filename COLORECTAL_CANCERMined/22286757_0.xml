<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UHRF1 is emerging as a cofactor that coordinates the epigenetic silencing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes, but its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that UHRF1 negatively regulates PPARG and is associated with a higher proliferative, clonogenic and migration potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistently, UHRF1 ectopic expression induces PPARG repression through its recruitment on the PPARG promoter fostering DNA methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> repressive modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In agreement, UHRF1 knockdown elicits PPARG re-activation, accompanied by positive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> marks and DNA demethylation, corroborating its role in PPARG silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UHRF1 overexpression, as well as PPARG-silencing, imparts higher growth rate and phenotypic features resembling those occurring in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our series of 110 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, high UHRF1-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are characterized by an undifferentiated phenotype, higher proliferation rate and poor clinical outcome only in advanced stages III-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the inverse relationship with PPARG found in vitro is detected in vivo and UHRF1 prognostic significance appears closely related to PPARG low expression, as remarkably validated in an independent dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that UHRF1 regulates PPARG silencing and both genes appear to be part of a complex regulatory network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the relationship between UHRF1 and PPARG may have a relevant role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
