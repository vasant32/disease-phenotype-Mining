<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied the efficacy and financial implications of such a clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This was a prospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients attending <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> clinics over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A lower-risk protocol for patients with Dukes A was used over 3 years and a higher-risk protocol for patients with Dukes B, C or D was used over 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Department of Health Pricing Charts were used to cost the follow-up protocols, and adjustment was performed to calculate the cost of each quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-three patients entered into this nurse-led follow-up protocol implemented by the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> clinic between 2005 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Dukes stages and proportions of patients in each stage were as follows: stage A, 13%; stage B, 8%; stage C, 36.3%; and stage D, 9.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven per cent underwent curative treatment and 2.6% had palliative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one per cent of patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall actuarial 5-year survival was 80% and recurrences had a 30% 5-year actuarial survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total cost per patient for 3 years of follow up was £1506 and £1179 for lower-risk rectal and nonrectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The adjusted cost for each QALY gained for lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> was £1914 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The total cost per patient with higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> was £1814 and £1487 for rectal and nonrectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The adjusted cost for each QALY gained was £2180 for higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This clinic demonstrated cost-effective detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) was the most sensitive alert test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recurrences were detected within 4 years, we suggest that this is the indicated time to follow up </plain></SENT>
