<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of a novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-optical photoacoustic scanner for imaging the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1658953" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor vasculature</z:e> and its response to a therapeutic vascular disrupting agent is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The scanner employs a Fabry-Perot polymer film ultrasound sensor for mapping the photoacoustic waves and an image reconstruction algorithm based upon attenuation-compensated acoustic time reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The system was used to noninvasively image human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> xenografts implanted subcutaneously in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Label-free three-dimensional in vivo images of whole <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> to depths of almost 10 mm with sub-100-micron spatial resolution were acquired in a longitudinal manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This enabled the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related vascular features, such as vessel tortuosity, feeding vessel recruitment, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> to be visualized over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The system was also used to study the temporal evolution of the response of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1658953" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor vasculature</z:e> following the administration of a therapeutic vascular disrupting agent (OXi4503) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This revealed the well-known destruction and recovery phases associated with this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies illustrate the broader potential of this technology as an imaging tool for the preclinical and clinical study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and other pathologies characterized by changes in the vasculature </plain></SENT>
