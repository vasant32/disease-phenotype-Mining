<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) survival depends mostly on stage at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, symptom duration at diagnosis or treatment have also been considered as predictors of stage and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to: 1) establish the distinct time-symptom duration intervals; 2) identify factors associated with symptom duration until diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incident cases of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during 2006-2009 (795 incident cases) in 5 Spanish regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from patients' interviews and reviews of primary care and hospital clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> symptoms, symptom perception, trust in the general practitioner (GP), primary care and hospital examinations/visits before diagnosis, type of referral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptom Diagnosis Interval (SDI) was calculated as time from first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> symptoms to date of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptom Treatment Interval (STI) was defined as time from first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> symptoms until start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonparametric tests were used to compare SDI and STI according to different variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptom to diagnosis interval for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 128 days and symptom treatment interval was 155 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were observed between colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Women experienced longer intervals than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Symptom presentation such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and the presence of obstruction led to shorter diagnostic or treatment intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Time elapsed was also shorter in those patients that perceived their first symptom/s as serious, disclosed it to their acquaintances, contacted emergencies services or had trust in their GPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Primary care and hospital doctor examinations and investigations appeared to be related to time elapsed to diagnosis or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results show that gender, symptom perception and help-seeking behaviour are the main patient factors related to interval duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Health service performance also has a very important role in symptom to diagnosis and treatment interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>If time to diagnosis is to be reduced, interventions and guidelines must be developed to ensure appropriate examination and diagnosis during both primary and hospital care </plain></SENT>
