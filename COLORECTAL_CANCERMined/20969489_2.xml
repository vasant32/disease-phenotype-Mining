<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that soy food and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> intake may be protective against the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, epidemiologic evidence remains sparse and inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We addressed this issue in the Fukuoka <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects were the 816 incident cases of histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 815 community controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intakes of soy foods and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi> were assessed by in-person interview using a computer-assisted dietary method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with adjustment for dietary intakes of calcium and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as for body mass index, physical activity, alcohol use, and other lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Energy-adjusted intakes of soy foods (dry weight) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi> were inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in men and postmenopausal women, but not in premenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted OR for the highest versus lowest quintile was 0.65 (95% CI 0.41-1.03, p for trend = 0.03) for soy foods and 0.68 (95% CI 0.42-1.10, p for trend = 0.051) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values for postmenopausal women were 0.60 (95% CI 0.29-1.25, p for trend = 0.053) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.33-1.40, p for trend = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The site-specific analysis showed inverse associations of soy foods (p for trend = 0.007) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi> (p for trend = 0.02) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings add to epidemiologic evidence for protective effects of soy foods and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi> in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
