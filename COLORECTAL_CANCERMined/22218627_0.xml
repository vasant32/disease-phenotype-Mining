<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Only about half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eligible Americans have been screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to test whether mailed educational materials and a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), with or without a scripted telephone reminder, led to FIT testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we compared changes in attitudes toward, readiness for, and barriers to screening from baseline to follow-up after education about screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects due for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were recruited from 16 Iowa Research Network family physician offices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Half of the subjects were randomized to receive mailed written and DVD educational materials, along with a FIT, either with or without a telephone call designed to encourage screening and address barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects completed surveys regarding their attitudes and readiness for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening at baseline and after education about screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was whether the subject completed FIT testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 373 individuals received educational materials (including a FIT) and 231 (62%) returned a posteducation survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 61.2 years; 52% were women, 99% were white, 39% had a high school education or less, 39% had a total family income of less than $40,000, and 7% had no insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The written materials were read by 82%, understood by 91% (of those who read them), and 82% felt their knowledge was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The DVD was viewed by 67%, understood by 94% of those who viewed it, and 86% felt the DVD increased their knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline, individuals reported being significantly more likely to bring up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening at their next doctor's visit (P &lt; .0001) and being more likely to be tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the next 6 months (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comparing baseline with follow-up, summary attitude scores improved (P &lt; .0001), readiness scores improved (P &lt; .0001), and there were fewer barriers (P = .034, Wilcoxon signed rank) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The FIT return rate increased from 0% to 45.2% in the education alone group and from 0% to 48.7% for the group receiving education plus the telephone call (P &lt; .0001 for each group individually and overall when compared with Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mailing FIT kits with easy-to-understand educational materials improved attitudes toward screening and dramatically increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates among patients who were due for screening in a practice-based research network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A telephone call addressing barriers to screening did not result in increased FIT testing compared with mailed education alone </plain></SENT>
