<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, HVH are often leaders in the utilization of novel surgical technology such as minimally invasive surgery (MIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although HVH often serve diverse patient populations, it is unknown if there are disparities in the application of new surgical technologies within these hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the use of MIS for colorectal disease exist at HVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Laparoscopic and open colectomies performed at HVH were identified using the 2008 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes were used to identify MIS colorectal resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression including ethnic and socioeconomic variables were used to identify independent predictive factors for undergoing MIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 211,862 colorectal resections were performed at HVH in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 16,637 (7.3%) colorectal resections were performed using MIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When evaluating racial and socioeconomic factors, patients within the highest income quartile were more likely to undergo MIS than those in the lowest income groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with Medicaid and uninsured patients were significantly less likely to undergo MIS compared to patients with private insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lastly, race was not a significant predictive factor for undergoing MIS for colorectal disease at HVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There are significant socioeconomic disparities in the use of MIS for colorectal disease at HVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future studies should be aimed at identifying access barriers to MIS in the treatment of colorectal disease </plain></SENT>
