<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability (MSI) occurs in 10-20% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e> and is associated with good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the development and validation of a genomic signature that identifies <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with MSI caused by DNA mismatch repair deficiency with high accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite status for 276 stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e> has been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Full-genome expression data was used to identify genes that correlate with MSI status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of these samples (n = 73) had sequencing data for 615 genes available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An MSI gene signature of 64 genes was developed and validated in two independent validation sets: the first consisting of frozen samples from 132 stage II patients; and the second consisting of FFPE samples from the PETACC-3 trial (n = 625) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 64-gene MSI signature identified MSI patients in the first validation set with a sensitivity of 90.3% and an overall accuracy of 84.8%, with an AUC of 0.942 (95% CI, 0.888-0.975) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second validation, the signature also showed excellent performance, with a sensitivity 94.3% and an overall accuracy of 90.6%, with an AUC of 0.965 (95% CI, 0.943-0.988) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides correct identification of MSI patients, the gene signature identified a group of MSI-like patients that were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> by standard assessment but MSI by signature assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MSI-signature could be linked to a deficient MMR phenotype, as both MSI and MSI-like patients showed a high mutation frequency (8.2% and 6.4% of 615 genes assayed, respectively) as compared to patients classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> (1.6% mutation frequency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MSI signature showed prognostic power in stage II patients (n = 215) with a hazard ratio of 0.252 (p = 0.0145) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with an MSI-like phenotype had also an improved survival when compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The MSI signature was translated to a diagnostic microarray and technically and clinically validated in FFPE and frozen samples </plain></SENT>
