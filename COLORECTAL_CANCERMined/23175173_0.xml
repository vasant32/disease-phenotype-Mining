<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to perform a detailed assessment of C4.4A expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues, in terms of intra-cellular localization, intra-tumoral location and difference in molecular weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To advance this goal, we developed three new antibodies against the C4.4A protein (two polyclonal Abs: C4.4A-119 and C4.4A-277 and one monoclonal Ab: C4.4A GPI-M) to use in addition to the two previously produced polyclonal Abs (C4.4A-81, C4.4A GPI-P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibody specificities were confirmed by absorption tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry showed that the C4.4A-119 and C4.4-277 Abs detected 70-kDa C4.4A, mainly in the cytoplasm, irrespective of intra-tumoral location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The C4.4A GPI-P and C4.4A GPI-M Abs reacted with the membranous ~40-kDa C4.4A, exclusively at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasive front, and each detected an identical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tested antibodies showed varied C4.4A detection rates in 33 CRC tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C4.4A-277 Ab yielded the highest positive rate in 29 of 33 CRC tissues (87.9%), while the C4.4A GPI-P and C4.4A GPI-M Abs each only showed 33.3% positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that the GPI anchor signaling sequence may be essential for detecting membranous C4.4A at the invasive front of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
