<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and matched tissues adjacent to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were collected from 43 CRC patients undergoing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues from 20 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were also sampled as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of SHH, SMO, GLI1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> was assessed by RT-PCR and proteins were detected by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations with clinicopathological characteristics of patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SHH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed more frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, but the difference did not reach significance in comparison to that in the adjacent tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SMO and GLI1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were expressed more frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues than in both adjacent andnormal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression intensities of SHH, SMO, GLI1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent tissues and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proteins were also detected more frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant links were apparent with gender, age, location, degree of infiltration or Dukes stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Positive rates and intensities of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of Hh signaling pathway related genes SHH, SMO, GLI1 were found to be significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, over-expression did not appear to be associated with particular clinicopathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
