<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) allows delivery of tumoricidal doses of radiation to areas of potential residual microscopic disease while minimizing doses to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IORT using high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy allows dose modulation and delivery of concomitant boosts to high-risk areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study describes a novel technique of HDR-IORT with dose painting (DP) (HDR-IORT-DP) and evaluates the clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent cancers</z:e> received HDR-IORT-DP at the time of radical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 13 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 2 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e>, and 1 had a gynecologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received external beam radiation previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Negative margin (R0) was obtained in 12 patients (75%) and microscopically positive margins (R1) in 4 patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median total target and boost area were 45 and 8.5cm(2), and HDR-IORT and boost dose were 1500 and 1750cGy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median followup was 14.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2-year local control and overall survival were 80% and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (69%) developed distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and were deceased at the time of the last followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 patients (19%) developed Grade 3 toxicity related to HDR-IORT; no grade 4+ toxicities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HDR-IORT-DP technique is feasible, safe, and allows for dose escalation in locally advanced or recurrent previously irradiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report on HDR-IORT-DP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to evaluate efficacy in a larger patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Local control was encouraging in our patients </plain></SENT>
