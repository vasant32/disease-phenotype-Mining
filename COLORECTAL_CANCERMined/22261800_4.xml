<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated safety, efficacy, and correlations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> genetic alterations and clinical benefit in 236 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancers</z:e> treated with phase I study drugs targeting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in our Phase I Clinical Trials Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six (32.2%) patients received a PI3K pathway inhibitor in combination with a MAPK pathway inhibitor (D), whereas 124 (52.5%) and 36 (15.3%), respectively, received an inhibitor of either the PI3K or MAPK pathways (S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rates of drug-related grade &gt;III adverse events were 18.1% for (S) and 53.9% for (D; P &lt; 0.001); the rates of dose-limiting toxicities were 9.4% for (S) and 18.4% for (D; P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent grade &gt;III adverse events were transaminase elevations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, and mucositis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> genomic analysis, of 9 patients who harbored coactivation of both pathways (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, n = 7; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients treated with (D) had <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> ranging from 2% to 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that dual inhibition of both pathways may potentially exhibit favorable efficacy compared with inhibition of either pathway, at the expense of greater toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this parallel pathway targeting strategy may be especially important in patients with coexisting PI3K pathway genetic alterations and KRAS or BRAF mutations and suggests that molecular profiling and matching patients with combinations of these targeted drugs will need to be investigated in depth </plain></SENT>
