<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> represent a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> which are the precursor lesions to serrated pathway colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histological classification of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> has evolved over the last two decades to distinguish three separate entities: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyp</z:mpath>, sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (SSA), and traditional serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (TSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The malignant potential of SSAs and TSAs has been clearly demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SSAs are more challenging to detect by colonoscopy and are likely to account for some interval <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> syndrome is now widely recognized as conferring a high risk of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> although its cause remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current understanding of the actual malignant potential of each serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> subtype is still limited due to the lack of large-scale prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient management guidelines have been recently updated although high-level evidence to support them is still required </plain></SENT>
