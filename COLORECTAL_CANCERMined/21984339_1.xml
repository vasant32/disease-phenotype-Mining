<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence shows that microRNAs, functioning as either oncogenes or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressors by negatively regulating downstream target genes that are actively involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598935" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour initiation</z:e> and progression, may be promising biomarkers and therapy targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data mining through a microRNA chip database indicated that let-7c may be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumour metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we confirmed that down-regulation of let-7c in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, advanced TNM stages and poor survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ectopic expression of let-7c in a highly metastatic Lovo cell line remarkably suppressed cell migration and invasion in vitro by the down-regulation of K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, MMP11 and PBX3, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in vivo, whereas inhibition of let-7c in low-metastatic HT29 cells increased cell motility and invasion by the enhanced gene expression of K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, MMP11 and PBX3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the luciferase reporters' activities with the 3'-UTRs of K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, MMP11 and PBX3 were inhibited significantly by let-7c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, rescue experiments involving the over-expression of these genes without their 3'-UTRs completely reversed the effects of let-7c on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumour metastasis</z:e>, both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the levels of let-7c were inversely correlated with those of MMP11 and PBX3, but not with those of K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results demonstrate that let-7c, apart from its <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> suppression role, also functions as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumour metastasis</z:e> suppressor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by directly destabilizing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of MMP11 and PBX3 at least </plain></SENT>
