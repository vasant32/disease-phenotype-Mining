<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The baculovirus-insect cell system is considered a feasible expression system for recombinant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> production due to its several advantages, including high capacity, flexibility, and glycosylation capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, accurate titering of the recombinant baculovirus is required to ensure high expression in insect cells using a commercial and expensive immunoassay titer kit in which the envelope <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV)-type baculovirus is detected by anti-envelope <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, conditions for the expression of the CO17-1A immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody (MAb) against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells in a baculovirus system were optimized without using a commercial titering kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several variables were investigated to optimize antibody expression in a baculovirus-insect cell system, including baculovirus passage, volume of the infecting baculovirus inoculum (100, 200, 400, and 800 μL), and the harvest time of insect cells or cell supernatants after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> (24, 48, and 72 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two different pFastBac vectors carrying the CO17-1A MAb genes with or without the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) fused to the HC (MAb CO17-1A K and MAb CO17-1A, respectively) were constructed and used to generate baculoviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis was conducted to confirm expression of MAb CO17-1A K and MAb CO17-1A in baculovirus-infected insect cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Densitometry analysis of the protein bands was used to quantify the relative expression under different conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest expression was observed in lysed cells infected with 400 μL of passage 3 baculovirus (P(3) BV) carrying the gene encoding the CO17-1A MAb without KDEL at 72 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> conditions, the number of virus passages, baculovirus inoculum volume, and the harvest time can be modified to optimize MAb expression without using a BaculoELISA titer kit in a baculovirus-insect cell system </plain></SENT>
