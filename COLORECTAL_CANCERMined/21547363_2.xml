<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MTRR is polymorphic at nucleotide 66 (A-to-G) and the resulting variant enzyme has a lower affinity for MTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reported associations of MTRR A66G polymorphism with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk are contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to better assess the associations, including 18,661 cases and 27,678 controls from 35 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between the MTRR A66G polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pooled ORs were performed for homozygote model (GG vs. AA), heterozygote model (GG vs. GA), recessive genetic model (GG vs. GA + AA), and dominant genetic model (GG + GA vs. AA), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, results indicated that the G allele and GG variant genotypes were associated with a significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk (G vs. A: OR, 1.039; 95% CI, 1.009-1.078; homozygote model: OR, 1.094; 95% CI, 1.006-1.191) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant increased risks were found among Asians with G allele (G vs. A: OR, 1.063; 95% CI, 1.011-1.119; homozygote model: OR, 1.189; 95% CI, 1.055-1.341; recessive model: OR, 1.197; 95% CI, 1.068-1.341) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For stratification analysis, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types with fewer than three studies were categorized into "other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>", and the results indicated that there was a significant elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in "other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>" in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models, not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study suggests that the MTRR A66G polymorphism is a potential biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
