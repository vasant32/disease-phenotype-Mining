<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A more detailed understanding of the somatic genetic events that drive gastrointestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> is necessary to improve diagnosis and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using data from high-density genomic profiling arrays, we conducted an analysis of somatic copy-number aberrations in 486 gastrointestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> including 296 esophageal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal amplifications were substantially more prevalent in gastric/esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 64 regions of significant recurrent amplification and deletion, some shared and others unique to the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> types examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amplified genes were noted in 37% of gastric/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumors</z:e>, including in therapeutically targetable kinases such as ERBB2, FGFR1, FGFR2, EGFR, and MET, suggesting the potential use of genomic amplifications as biomarkers to guide therapy of gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> where targeted therapeutics have been less developed compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amplified loci implicated genes with known involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> but also pointed to regions harboring potentially novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genes, including a recurrent deletion found in 15% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumors</z:e> where the <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>Runt</z:mp> transcription factor subunit RUNX1 was implicated, including by functional experiments in tissue culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, our results defined genomic features that were common and distinct to various gut-derived <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, potentially informing novel opportunities for targeted therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
