<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is one of the most common <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of imprinting (LOI) of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene is an epigenetic abnormality observed in human colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the feasibility of using the IGF2 imprinting system for targeted gene therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We constructed a novel oncolytic adenovirus, Ad315-E1A, and a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus, Ad315-EGFP, driven by the IGF2 imprinting system by inserting the H19 promoter, CCCTC binding factor, enhancer, human adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene into a pDC-315 shuttle plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell lines with IGF2 LOI (HCT-8 and HT-29), which were infected with Ad315-EGFP, produced EGFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no EGFP was produced in cell lines with maintenance of imprinting (HCT116 and GES-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that Ad315-E1A significantly decreased cell viability and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> only in LOI cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, mice bearing HCT-8-xenografted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, which received intratumoral administration of the oncolytic adenovirus, showed significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and enhanced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our recombinant oncolytic virus targeting the IGF2 LOI system inhibits LOI cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and provides a novel approach for targeted gene therapy </plain></SENT>
