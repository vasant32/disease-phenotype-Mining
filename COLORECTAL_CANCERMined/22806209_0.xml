<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the presence of free <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells found in lavage cytology specimens taken from the proximity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> during the course of curative open and laparoscopic colorectal resections and then examine and compare the long-term disease outcomes in cases of negative and positive cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the results, we were hoping to identify the place of peritumoral lavage cytology among prognostic factors for disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2007 intraoperative peritoneal lavage cytology was performed in 145 patients who underwent curative colorectal procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 37 of the procedures were laparoscopic resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Malignant cells were detected in the intraoperative peritoneal lavage cytology samples from 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 47 months (3-81 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 25 patients with positive cytology; locoregional recurrence or distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was found in 14 during this period (56 %), whereas among the 120 patients with negative cytology the incidence was 28 (23 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, lymph node status, and peritoneal lavage cytology on recurrence rates is significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>, nodal, and lavage cytology status can be organized hierarchically in relation to time of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytology is most important, with positivity rendering long-term prognosis unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When comparing surgical techniques (open versus laparoscopic), we found no significant difference in recurrence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study has shown that conventional peritoneal lavage cytology is a prognostic factor in the case of patients undergoing curative colorectal operations </plain></SENT>
