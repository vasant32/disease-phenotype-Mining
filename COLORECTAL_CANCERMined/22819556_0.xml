<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these compounds have been widely implicated in antitumorigenic and proapoptotic properties in animal as well as in vitro models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the underlying cellular mechanisms regulated by <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50182">DIM</z:chebi> are only partially understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a member of the ATF/c-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> response element-binding (CREB) subfamily of the basic-region leucine zipper family and has been known to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ATF3 induction by <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50182">DIM</z:chebi> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50182">DIM</z:chebi> treatment induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and induced ATF3 gene expression at protein and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="29" ids="50182">DIM</z:chebi> increased ATF3 promoter activity, and the region of -84 to +34 within ATF3 promoter was responsible for promoter activation by <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50182">DIM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This region contained an ATF binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deletion and point mutation of the ATF binding site (-23 to -16) abolished ATF3 promoter activation by <z:chebi fb="29" ids="50182">DIM</z:chebi>, and overexpression of ATF4 enhanced ATF3 transactivation </plain></SENT>
