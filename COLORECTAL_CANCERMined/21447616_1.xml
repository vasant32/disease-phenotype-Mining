<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicentre, phase I, open-label, dose-finding trial, FOLFIRI was administered every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> regimens were explored: Schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off; 37.5 and 50 mg/day) and continuous daily dosing (CDD; 37.5 and 25 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxic toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated during weeks 1-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was a secondary objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 37.5 mg/day Schedule 4/2 cohort had zero of six DLTs, was expanded by 15 patients and declared the MTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MTD was exceeded at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> doses and schedules; DLTs included febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (n=1), grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (n=4) and grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> with grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the MTD, non-haematologic grade 3/4 adverse events with a frequency of &gt;10% were diarrhoea, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo>, and the objective response rate was 57.9% (95% confidence interval 33.5-79.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The MTD of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> combined with FOLFIRI in chemotherapy-naive mCRC was 37.5 mg/day on Schedule 4/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CDD of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> at 37.5 or 25 mg/day plus FOLFIRI was not feasible </plain></SENT>
