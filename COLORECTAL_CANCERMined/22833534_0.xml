<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of variants identified in MMR and other common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility genes are missense or noncoding changes whose consequences for pathogenicity cannot be easily interpreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such variants are designated as "variants of uncertain significance" (VUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Management of LS can be significantly improved by identifying individuals who carry a pathogenic variant and thus benefit from screening, preventive, and therapeutic measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, identifying family members that do not carry the variant is important so they can be released from the intensive surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Determining which genetic variants are pathogenic and which are neutral is a major challenge in clinical genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The profound mechanistic knowledge on the genetics and biochemistry of MMR enables the development and use of targeted assays to evaluate the pathogenicity of variants found in suspected patients with LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We describe different approaches for the functional analysis of MMR gene VUS and propose development of a validated diagnostic framework </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we call attention to common misconceptions about functional assays and endorse development of an integrated approach comprising validated assays for diagnosis of VUS in patients suspected of LS </plain></SENT>
