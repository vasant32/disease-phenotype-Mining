<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Infiltrative growth pattern at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> margin has been associated with shorter patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the prognostic significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> pattern, independent of tumoral molecular alterations and other histologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Utilizing a database of 1139 colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients in two prospective cohort studies, histologic features including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> pattern, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, lymphocytic reaction, mucinous component, and signet ring cell component were recorded by a single pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard model was used to compute mortality hazard ratio, adjusting for clinical, pathologic, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> molecular features, including microsatellite instability, the CpG island methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1139 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, we observed expansile growth pattern in 372 tumors (33%), intermediate growth pattern in 610 tumors (54%), and infiltrative growth pattern in 157 tumors (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with expansile growth pattern, those with infiltrative growth pattern experienced shorter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (log rank P &lt; 0.0001; multivariate hazard ratio 1.74; 95% confidence interval 1.22-2.47) and overall survival (log rank P &lt; 0.0001; multivariate hazard ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.33-2.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prognostic association of infiltrative growth pattern was confined to patients with stage I-III disease (P (interaction) with stage = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infiltrative growth pattern was associated with worse prognosis among stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, independent of other clinical, pathologic, and molecular characteristics </plain></SENT>
