<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study presents the characteristics and outcomes in 144 patients treated in phase I clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes in 144 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> referred to the phase I clinic at MD Anderson </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age was 60 years (range, 35-86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median number of previous systemic therapies was 4 (range, 1-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median PFS with the last line of conventional systemic treatment was 12.3 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.0-14.4); the median PFS of the best phase I treatment was shorter at 8.1 weeks (95% CI, 7.9-8.7 weeks; log-rank test, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis that included the RMH score, sex (male vs. female, P = .02; hazard ratio [HR], 1.57), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (&lt; 10.5 vs. â‰¥ 10.5 g/dL; P = .03; HR 1.79), and the RMH score (2-3 vs. 0-1; P &lt; .003; HR, 1.85) were significant predictors of poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The PFS of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in phase I treatment was shorter than it was on their last line of conventional systemic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed the value of the RMH score for predicting overall survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> enrolled in phase I studies </plain></SENT>
