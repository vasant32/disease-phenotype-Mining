<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of unresectable multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, in which there was such a good response to panitumumab as third-line chemotherapy, that they were converted into resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old man was admitted to our department for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> with synchronous unresectable multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> was resected, modified FOLFOX6 regimen was started as first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 10 courses of FOLFOX6 followed by 14 courses of sLV5FU2 regimen, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> became smaller and were thought to be resectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before hepatectomy, we performed portal vein embolization to enlarge the remnant liver, but the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grew larger again and we had to cancel the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, the second-line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI regimen failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As third-line chemotherapy, panitumumab alone was administered to him and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> greatly shrank after 5 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We were able to resect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> with extended right posterior segmentectomy and partial resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He has been well without recurrence for one year since hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case is rare in that panitumumab alone as third-line chemotherapy shrank unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and made them resectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The result is highly suggestive for management, including chemotherapy and operation of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
