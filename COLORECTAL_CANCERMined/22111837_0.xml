<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the direct medical cost of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (CRN) from newly diagnosed to the completion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific treatment in the initial year of disease across stages and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> primary sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Only direct medical costs from the perspective of the health care service provider were incorporated in the cost analysis (in 2009 USD) using a bottom-up approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e>-specific treatments of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy data in the initial year of disease were identified from the 401 CRN adult patients by a review of their medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Service utilization for diagnosis, staging, pre-operative assessment and post-operative follow-up consultations was estimated from the recommendations of established surveillance and clinical practice guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Direct medical cost for the care of a newly diagnosed CRN was ranging from $1941 for low-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> to $45 115 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> in the initial year of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs of care showed a gradient increase from $1748 for low-risk <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> to $42 899 for stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and from $2232 for low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0100896'>rectal polyps</z:hpo> to $48 453 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0861772" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic/pre-operative assessment and treatment accounted for most of total costs of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> (58.9-76.7%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (60.8-85.2%) care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results provided stage and site-specific estimations of the direct medical costs of CRN in a Chinese population that can assist policy decision making and facilitate health care service planning and cost-effectiveness evaluations </plain></SENT>
