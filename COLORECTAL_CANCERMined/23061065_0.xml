<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive colonoscopy reports of patients undergoing screening or surveillance for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following a pre-intervention quality audit conducted in 2009, some modifications were made to the reporting software (Endoworks, Olympus Corporation, USA), including changes to field navigation, drop-down menus and visual cues, to optimize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compulsory items identified by existing guidelines in the report-generating template </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results from both audits were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent validation of 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 250 patient reports (mean [± SD] age 61.7±10.2 years, 51.2% female, February to May 2011) of five endoscopists (mean 11.6±7.8 years in practice), procedural indication was always present, as was informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six per cent of patients had undergone previous colonoscopy, 41% provided a previous colonoscopy date, with details on past <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removal in 42.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most procedural indicators were recorded (examination date 100%, medications given 100%, difficulty level 96.4%, preparation quality 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> reports noted extent of visualization (cecal intubation in 97.6%, photo documentation in 96.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total procedural time was recorded in 8.2% and withdrawal time in 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> were reported in 112 patients (44.8%), with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size (5.01±4.42 mm) reported in 95.5%, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in 88.4% and anatomical location in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The method of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removal was missing in 2.7% of reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements were noted in the documentation of withdrawal and total time, cecal landmarks, type of bowel preparation, completeness of removal, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and method of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removal, and photo documentation compared with the 2009 audit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results illustrate the value of targeted modifications to an electronic colonoscopic reporting system in significantly enhancing the quality of reporting </plain></SENT>
