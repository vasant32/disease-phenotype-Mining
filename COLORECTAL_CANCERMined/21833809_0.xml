<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: New technologies for microwave ablation (MWA) have been conceived, designed to achieve larger areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> compared with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to report complications by using this technique in patients with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Members of 14 Italian centers used a 2.45-GMHz generator delivering energy through a cooled miniature-choke MW antenna and a standardized protocol for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They completed a questionnaire regarding number and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, major and minor complications and side effects, and likelihood of their relationship to the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enrollment included 736 patients with 1.037 lesions: 522 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, 187 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> predominantly from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and 27 had cholangiocellular <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size ranged from 0.5 to 10 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 13 centers, the approach used was percutaneous, in 4 videolaparoscopic, and in 3 laparotomic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in 22 cases (2.9%), and minor complications in 54 patients (7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications of MWA do not differ from those RFA, both being based on the heat damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results of this multicenter study confirmed those of single-center experiences, indicating that MWA is a safe procedure, with no mortality and a low rate of major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The low rate of complications was probably due to precautions adopted, knowing in advance possible risk conditions, on the basis of prior RFA experience </plain></SENT>
