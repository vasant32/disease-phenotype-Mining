<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the use of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for in vivo detection and quantitative characterization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> in the transgenic APC(Δ468) mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-resolution T(1)-weighted (T(1)W) images, T(2)-weighted (T(2)W) images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) measurements were performed using a 7.0 T small-animal imaging system (N = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were identified on both T(1)W and T(2)W images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (2.8 ± 0.9 mm, mean ± SD) were detected with high-resolution MRI across a distance of roughly 3 cm from the rectum to the splenic flexure, whereas 29 tumors were found within corresponding colon tissue samples examined at gross necropsy in the same area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T(2) values were significantly different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, skeletal muscle, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal wall tissues (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For analysis of the vascular characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> tissues using DCE measurements, the initial area under the curve (IAUC) for Gd contrast concentration curve (time) (C(Gd) [t]) was calculated with integration times of 60 and 120 seconds post-contrast infusion; two integration times were selected to capture both tracer wash-in and wash-out characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IAUC measurements were significantly larger in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues compared to both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal wall and skeletal muscle tissues (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo anatomic and quantitative MRI measurements were readily feasible in the transgenic APC(Δ468) mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These noninvasive methods should improve experimental efficiencies during longitudinal survival studies that otherwise would require single-end-point necropsy measurements </plain></SENT>
