<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the relationship between polymorphisms (28 bp repeated sequences in 5'-UTR and 6-bp ins/ del in 3'-UTR) in then thymidylate synthetase gene (TS) and risk of colorectal, colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e>, we conducted a case-control study with 315 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 439 population-based controls in Jiangsu province, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TS genotypes were identified using PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated with an unconditional logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the distributions of 5'-UTR genotypes in TS were significantly different between controls and male colon cases (Ï‡2 =8.25, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with 3R/3R genotype, individuals with the 2R allele were at an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (age-, BMI-, smoking- and alcohol drinking-adjusted OR=1.98, 95%CI: 1.11-3.53) among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the 6-bp ins/del polymorphism at the TS 3'- UTR did not influence risk of the colorectal, colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When combined genotypes for both TS 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR polymorphisms were evaluated, individuals with the 5'-UTR 2R allele had a OR of 3.61 (95%CI: 1.38-9.49) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> among men with the 3'-UTR -6bp/-6bp genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that the polymorphism of the 28 bp repeated sequences in TS 5'-UTR could influence susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and that there was a coordinated effect between TS 3'-UTR and 5'-UTR polymorphisms in increasing risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> among Chinese men </plain></SENT>
