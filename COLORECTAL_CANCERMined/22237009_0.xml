<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analysed 12(S)-LOX expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e> and found gene expression up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens for which the pathology report described involvement of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using cell line models exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34146">12(S)-HETE</z:chebi> or over-expressing 12(S)-LOX malignant cell growth as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumour cell migration</z:e> was found to be stimulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, Caco2 and SW480 cells over-expressing 12(S)-LOX formed fewer colonies from sparse cultures, but migrated better in filter-migration assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SW480 LOX cells also had higher anchorage-independent growth capacity and a higher tendency to metastasise in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knock-down or inhibition of 12(S)-LOX inhibited cell migration and anchorage-independent growth in both 12(S)-LOX transfectants and SW620 cells that express high endogenous levels of 12(S)-LOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the cell surface E-cadherin and integrin-Î²1 expression were down-regulated in a 12(S)-LOX-dependent manner disturbing cell-cell interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that 12(S)-LOX expression in inflammatory areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e> has the capacity to induce an invasive phenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and could be targeted for therapy </plain></SENT>
