<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> risk is increased in SPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We determined the prevalence of SPS in a cohort of patients with large (≥ 2 cm) sessile colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and the rate at which the diagnosis was made by the clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Review of patient care database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were used to identify cases of SPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary academic center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 529 consecutive patients referred for endoscopic resection of a sessile colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> ≥ 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of SPS in the cohort and frequency with which the referring physician and the endoscopist recognized SPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 529 patients, 20 (4%) met the WHO criteria for SPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of these cases was suspected by a referring physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases (60%) were either diagnosed or suspected by the endoscopist at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients without SPS, those with SPS were more likely to have an index lesion (the lesion that led to referral) that was serrated (60% vs 3.8%), to have a cecal or ascending colon index lesion (70% vs 45%), and to be current smokers (42% vs 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Including the first colonoscopy to remove the index lesion and 26 follow-up colonoscopies, the endoscopist at our center removed 183 serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> from the 20 patients with SPS; of those <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 68 were &gt;1 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients were referred for surgical resection of involved colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 20 patients with SPS met the WHO criterion of 5 serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> proximal to the sigmoid, of which 2 are &gt;1 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Failure to recognize SPS by the referring physician was at least partly related to unrecognized serrated lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Failure to recognize SPS by the endoscopist at our institution was the result of not systematically applying WHO criteria to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SPS was common in a cohort of patients with large sessile colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and it was frequently unrecognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the need for better detection of serrated lesions, better awareness of SPS, and more consistent application of SPS criteria to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> findings of individual patients </plain></SENT>
