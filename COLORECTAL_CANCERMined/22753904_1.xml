<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effect of cetuximab dose escalation in patients with irinotecan-refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who had developed no or mild skin reactions after 21 days of treatment at the standard dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article reports clinical and pharmacokinetic (PK) data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: After 21 days of standard-dose cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) initial dose, then 250 mg/m(2) per week) plus irinotecan, patients with ≤ grade 1 skin reactions were randomly assigned to standard-dose (group A) or dose-escalated (to 500 mg/m(2) per week; group B) cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with ≥ grade 2 skin reactions continued on standard-dose cetuximab plus irinotecan (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population comprised 157 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PK profiles reflected the dose increase and were predictable across the dose range investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weekly cetuximab doses of up to 500 mg/m(2) were well tolerated, and grade 3 and 4 adverse events were generally comparable between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dose escalation (n = 44) was associated with an increase in skin reactions ≥ grade 2 compared with standard (n = 45) dosing (59% v 38%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dose escalation, compared with standard dosing, showed some evidence for improved response rate (30% v 16%, respectively) and disease control rate (70% v 58%, respectively) but no indication of benefit in relation to overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In an exploratory analysis, dose escalation seemed to increase response rate compared with standard dosing in patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> but not KRAS mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cetuximab serum concentrations increased predictably with dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher dose levels were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The possible indication for improved efficacy in the dose-escalation group warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
