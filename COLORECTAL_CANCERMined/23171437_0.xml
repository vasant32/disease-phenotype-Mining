<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the mechanism is the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in which Fc region of the antibody binds to the Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) expressed by immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa and clinical outcome in mCRC treated with anti-EGFR antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive patients with mCRC were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genotypes for FcγRIIa-131 histidine (H)/arginine (R), FcγRIIIa-158 valine (V)/phenylanaline (F) polymorphisms were evaluated by directly sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was performed for FcγRIIIa-158 valine (V)/phenylanaline (F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlations between FcγR polymorphisms, baseline patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> features were studied by contingency tables and the chi-square test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was applied to the progression-free survival (PFS) curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis was performed with the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to analyze the effect of multiple risk factors on PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FcγRIIIa polymorphisms were significantly associated with response to anti-EGFR-based therapy in 49 patients with kras wt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was not association with response for FcγRIIa polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, obtained results suggested that prognosis is particularly unfavorable for patients carrying the FcγRIIIa-158F/F genotype (median PFS V/V, V/F, F/F: 18.2 vs 17.3 vs 9.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No prognostic ability was identified for FcγRIIa polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In mCRC patients the presence of FcγRIIIa-F can predict resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and unfavorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
