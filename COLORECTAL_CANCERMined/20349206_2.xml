<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aspirin was added to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells (HT-29 and RKO) or to PBMC incubated separately or jointly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The secretion of IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-10 induced by HT-29 cells was decreased, that of IL-1β was slightly increased, whereas IL-1ra production was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With RKO cells, aspirin reduced IL-6, IL-1ra, and IL-10 synthesis and enhanced IFNγ secretion, while IL-1β remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditioned media from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells incubated without or with aspirin stimulated cytokine productions by PBMC similarly, suggesting that aspirin acts on the cell-to-cell interaction between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and PBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that aspirin alter the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines generated by interaction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and immune cells disclosing an additional role of the drug in affecting <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
