<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is common in England and, with long-term survival relatively poor, improving outcomes is a priority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major initiative to reduce mortality from the disease has been the introduction of the National Health Service (NHS) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme (BCSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Combining data from the BCSP with that in the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Data Repository (NCDR) allows <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> diagnosed in England to be categorised according to their involvement with the BCSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study sought to quantify the characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> diagnosed within and outside the BCSP and investigate its impact on outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Linkage of the NCDR and BCSP data allowed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> diagnosed between July 2006 and December 2008 to be categorised into four groups; screen-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, screening-interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> diagnosed in non-participating invitees and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> diagnosed in those never invited to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The characteristics, management and outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in each category were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 76 943 individuals were diagnosed with their first primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 2213 (2.9%) were screen-detected, 623 (0.8%) were screening-interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, 1760 (2.3%) were diagnosed in individuals in non-participating invitees and 72â€‰437 (94.1%) were diagnosed in individuals not invited to participate in the programme due to its ongoing roll-out over the time period studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Screen-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were identified at earlier Dukes' stages, were more likely to be managed with curative intent and had significantly better outcomes than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in other categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Screen-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> had a significantly better prognosis than other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and this would suggest that the BCSP should reduce mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in England </plain></SENT>
