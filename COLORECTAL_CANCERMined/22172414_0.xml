<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Among 38 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> exhibiting the V pit pattern on magnifying endoscopy, the findings on EUS with a mini-probe (15 MHz) were compared with histopathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of EUS were examined separately in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> exhibiting the Vi or V5 pit pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy of EUS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> exhibiting the Vi pit pattern on magnifying endoscopy with submucosal invasion of 1,000 μm or deeper was 9/15 (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity was 90%, specificity 14.3%, positive predictive value 31.7% and negative predictive value 76.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy of EUS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> exhibiting the VN pit pattern on magnify-ing endoscopy with submucosal invasion of 1,000 μm or deeper was 13/18 (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of EUS were 100% and 37.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EUS tended to diagnose the invasion depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with submucosal invasion exhibiting the V pit pattern as deeper than it actually was </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EUS accurately diagnosed early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with shallow invasion exhibiting the VN pit pattern and surgery was avoided </plain></SENT>
