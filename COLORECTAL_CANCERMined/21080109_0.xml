<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1) Expression of SGLT1 (P = 0.00) and EGFR (P = 0.01) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues was higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) For first-line chemotherapy, expression of SGLT1 (P = 0.06 and P = 0.21) and EGFR (P = 0.37 and P = 0.31) had no influence on objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) </plain></SENT>
