<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study within the UK General Practice Research Database population which included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients newly diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2008, followed until 31 December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of incident primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with the use of ADT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary analyses considered cumulative duration of use and specific ADTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort included a total of 21,503 patients, of whom 184 were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during a mean (SD) follow-up 4.0 (3.0) years (rate 2.4/1,000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, use of ADT was not associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.73-1.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no association was observed in terms of duration use, although this secondary analysis may have been limited by statistical power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With respect to specific ADTs, bilateral orchiectomy was the only therapy associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HR 2.50, 95 % CI 1.13-5.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, the use of ADT is not associated with an increased risk of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increased risk observed with bilateral orchiectomy may possibly be due to the prolonged <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> suppression of this therapy </plain></SENT>
