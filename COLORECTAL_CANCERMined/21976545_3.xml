<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic variation in proinflammatory pathways can affect an individual's <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have investigated the prognostic importance of this genetic variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival and genetic variation in proinflammatory pathways among patients from the Puget Sound Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in five genes (PTGS-1, PTGS-2, MRP4, NFκB, and IκBKβ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vital status was ascertained through linkage to the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The false discovery rate method of Benjamini and Hochberg was applied to address multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four PTGS-1 variants were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One, G&gt;A intron 9 (rs1213266), was associated with approximately 50% lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality (HR(AA/AG vs. GG) = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three variants, including L237M, resulted in significantly elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality risk, with HRs ranging from approximately 1.5 to 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two variants in IκBKβ, including R526Q, were significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Correction for multiple testing indicated that variants in both PTGS-1 and IκBKβ are reproducibly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that genetic variation in proinflammatory pathways may be important for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This investigation represents one of the first descriptions of the relationship between inherited polymorphisms and mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and provides a starting point for further research </plain></SENT>
