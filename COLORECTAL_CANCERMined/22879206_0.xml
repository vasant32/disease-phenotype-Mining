<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) are at increased risk for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> because of endogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exogenous insulin therapy has been associated with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between exogenous insulin therapy and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> formation, accounting for duration of therapy and location and stage of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> between the ages of 50 and 80 years who completed full colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were patients with any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> on index colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients without any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> composed the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and associated confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the controls, case patients (n = 196) did not have a significantly increased odds of insulin exposure, when exposure was defined as 12 months or more of insulin use compared with no insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the odds of insulin exposure among the cases was significantly increased when exposure was defined as 18 months or more (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), 24 months or more (OR 1.7, CI 1.1-2.6), and 36 months or more (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.4) of insulin use (test for trend P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar trend in insulin exposure was seen among type 2 diabetics with advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> location was not significantly affected by insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> insulin therapy is associated with increased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> patients receiving insulin may need more stringent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
