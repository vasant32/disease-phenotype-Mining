<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Double contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema (DCBE) is one of the investigation tools used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the incidence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> detected at screening by DCBE in Thai people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The computerized radiology database of screening DCBE in Thai adults between June 2009 and October 2011 at the Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DCBE examination performed in a surveillance program after curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> resection or the removal of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was also considered as a screening DCBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 819 screening DCBEs performed during this 28-month period were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients was 59.8 âˆ“ 13.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the total, 467 (57%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and a previous history of curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> resection or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> removal were noted in 34 patients (4%) and 124 patients (15%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 31 patients (3.8%; 95%CI = 2.7%-5.3%) were reported to have colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> or mass demonstrated on DCBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, follow-up endoscopy was performed in 20 cases (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to pathological results, the incidence of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detected at screening DCBE was 0.7% (95%CI = 0.3%-1.6%; n=6) and 0.4% (95%CI = 0.1%-1.1%; n=3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The screening DCBE performed in Thai adults had a diagnostic yield of 0.7% for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 0.4% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
