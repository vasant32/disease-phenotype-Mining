<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current study was conducted to retrospectively investigate the effects of reducing average relative dose intensity (ARDI) in response to adverse events on time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> receiving modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) therapy between January 2006 and May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups based on ARDI: those with an ARDI of 85% or more (ARDI maintained; n = 12) and those with an ARDI of less than 85% (ARDI reduced; n = 37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ARDI-reduced group, out of a total of 402 treatment courses conducted, 25.9% involved treatment delays and 8.2% involved dose reductions, and the incidence rate of treatment delay was significantly higher than that of dose reduction (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematological toxicity was the main reason for both treatment delays and dose reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced ARDI by dose reduction effectively prevented any increase in the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and the treatment delays in the next courses, suggesting that the dose reductions were appropriately performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> in the ARDI-maintained and ARDI-reduced groups was 5.2 and 5.8 months, respectively (p = 0.225) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median OS was 15.5 months and 33.9 months in the ARDI-maintained and ARDI-reduced groups, respectively (p = 0.347) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that reductions in ARDI of mFOLFOX6 therapy for metastatic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> due to treatment delays and dose reductions in response to adverse events do not necessarily lead to shortened <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> and OS </plain></SENT>
