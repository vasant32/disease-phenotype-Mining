<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Systemic therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) has undergone significant development in the past 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapy regimens consisting of combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated greater efficacy and contributed to a significant survival improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the majority of patients who undergo resection for liver-only CRLM are at risk of disease recurrence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, combining resection with systemic therapy appears sensible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, trial-based evidence is sparse to support this concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peri-operative FOLFOX has demonstrated a progression-free survival benefit in a single Phase III trial; the safety of chemotherapy and subsequent operations was acceptable and only a few patients showed initial progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy-associated liver injury (CALI), including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinusoidal obstruction syndrome</z:e> and steatohepatitis, has been observed after cytotoxic therapy, and should have implications for chemotherapy plans prior to hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, pre-operative chemotherapy should not extend beyond 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with unresectable liver-only CRLM, a response to chemotherapy could establish resectability and should be considered an initial treatment goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with unresectable CRLM, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>- or irinotecan-containing combinations represent the standard options, although single-agent choices may be appropriate for individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of bevacizumab carries the potential for a greater response and possibly for reduced CALI risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> without K-ras mutations, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents are also reasonable choices for a greater response and improved survival outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is crucial that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> systemic CRLM treatment decisions include proper definitions of treatment goals and endpoints, and are derived based on appropriate multidisciplinary considerations for other potentially applicable local or regional modalities </plain></SENT>
