<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the independent associations between multiple health status indicators and breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (CRCS) in a national US sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Analysis of cross-sectional data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) involved 5115 men and 7100 women aged 50 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: Health status indicators included: self-reported perceived health status, number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions, and functional limitation due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals were considered adherent to CRCS guidelines if they reported having a home-based fecal occult blood test in the past year or endoscopy in the past 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women were adherent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening guidelines if they reported having a mammogram in the previous 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were conducted using SUDAAN software to account for the complex sampling of the NHIS survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to examine associations between each of the health status indicators and screening adherence for CRCS and mammography and to calculate estimated screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: The three health status indicators were independently and differentially associated with screening adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor perceived health was associated with lower mammography among women, whereas a greater number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions were consistently associated with greater screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In adjusted analyses, functional limitation was only significantly associated with greater CRCS among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses included three common indicators of health status and provide new evidence of their complex associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies must examine the mechanisms by which these indicators influence screening recommendations and adherence among older adults over time </plain></SENT>
