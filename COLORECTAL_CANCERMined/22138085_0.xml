<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of subcentimeter (&lt;10 mm) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> is lower for procedures with inadequate preparation quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates of small (6-9 mm) and diminutive (â‰¤ 5 mm) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in patients with poor and fair quality preparations with those with adequate quality preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study and multivariable, hierarchical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved 8800 colonoscopies performed from 2001 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Preparation quality rating, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preparation quality was rated as fair in 2809 (31.9%) and poor in 829 (9.4%) colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with poor compared with adequate quality, the detection rate was lower for diminutive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (odds ratio [OR] 0.57; 95% CI, 0.47-0.70) but not for small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (OR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the detection rate of diminutive (OR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94-1.24]) or small (OR 1.09; 95% CI, 0.94-1.27) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in patients with fair compared with adequate quality preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Detection of advanced histology in patients with poor preparation quality was lower than in those with adequate quality (P = .027; 3.3% vs 5.0%), but there was no difference in those with fair compared with adequate quality (P = .893; 4.9% vs 5.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Single-center study; no standardization of preparation quality or size measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A fair preparation quality rating does not decrease the detection rate for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> of any size or for advanced histology, suggesting that fair quality may be considered adequate and that follow-up intervals may not need to be shortened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Poor preparation quality decreases the detection rate of diminutive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and advanced histology, suggesting substandard colonoscopy performance </plain></SENT>
