<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery is widely employed in the curative treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but its value in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent laparoscopic resection of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in this unit between June 1991 and Jan 2010 were entered into a prospective computerized database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes for patients with laparoscopic resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> were compared with those of patients who had laparoscopic surgery for stage I disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some 185 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent laparoscopic resection were compared with 310 patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677947" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage I colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some 94·1 and 98·4 per cent of operations respectively were completed laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hospital stay was slightly longer in the group with stage IV disease (mean 6·2 versus 5·3 days; P = 0·091) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality rate was 2·7 per cent in patients with stage IV disease and 0·6 per cent in those with stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (P = 0·061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-year survival rates were 77·8 and 99·0 per cent respectively (P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Short-term outcomes after laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> in selected patients are equivalent to those for stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
