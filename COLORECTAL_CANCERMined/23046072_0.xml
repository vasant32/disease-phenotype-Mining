<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate possible association between the promoter region polymorphisms of the SOCS3 gene and metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in a Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DNA samples obtained from 103 patients and 109 healthy individuals were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and nucleotide sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five sets of primers designed for the SOCS3 gene were used, and we did not detect significant differences in genotype frequencies for any of these polymorphisms between the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only the S3P1 region showed polymorphism and displayed three (1,2,4, 2,3,4 and 2,4) genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 2,3,4 genotype was observed in 3 patients, but not in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the sequence analysis revealed that the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> positioned at -914 and -1031â€‰nt had the polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence analysis of SSCP band 1 and band 3 revealed C-914A (rs12953258) and T-1031C (rs111033850) polymorphisms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The T-1031C polymorphism lies in the border of the STAT-binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The T-1031C polymorphism (rs111033850) is a newly identified single nucleotide polymorphism with this study, and we submitted this to the NCBI database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, these results suggested that there is no marked association between SOCS3 gene promoter region polymorphisms and the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
