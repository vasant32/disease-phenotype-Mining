<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend offering genetic testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> to individuals whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> suggest this condition and to relatives of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known, however, regarding how patients view the prospect of such testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, data on preferences (utilities) for the potential outcomes of testing decisions for use in cost-effectiveness analyses are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Time tradeoff utilities were elicited for 10 potential outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> testing decisions and 3 associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> from 70 participants, representing a range of knowledge about and experiences with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Highest mean utilities were assigned to scenarios in which only the assessor's sibling had Lynch-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (ranging from 0.669 ± 0.231 to 0.760 ± 0.220) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Utilities assigned to scenarios in which the assessor had Lynch-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> ranged from 0.605 ± 0.252 to 0.682 ± 0.246, whereas the lowest mean utilities were assigned to 2 of the general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> states (0.601 ± 0.238 and 0.593 ± 0.272 for colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 43% of the sample assigned higher values to undergoing Lynch testing and receiving negative results versus forgoing Lynch testing, whereas 50% assigned higher values to undergoing rather than forgoing surgery to prevent a subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, regardless of results, can have profound effects on quality of life; the utilities we collected can be used to incorporate these effects into cost-effectiveness analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, preferences for the potential outcomes of testing vary substantially, calling into question the extent to which patients would avail themselves of such testing if it were offered to them </plain></SENT>
