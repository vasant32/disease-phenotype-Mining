<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemoprevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> can be achieved by inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> using synthetic compound, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> and natural <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, Dolastatin 15 in an effective manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But the apoptotic signaling by these two drugs remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was thus focused on the role of Bcl(2) family of proteins and their interplay with p53 in rats during the chemoprevention by these two drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treatment for 6 wk with 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), animals showed a marked occurrence of multiple plaque lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a simultaneous treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> and Dolastatin 15 decreases such number to a significant level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DMH treatment also decreases the number of apoptotic cells in the colonic enterocytes which were corrected to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> and Dolastatin 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased expression of Bcl(2) while other proteins like Bax, Apaf-1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c, and caspases in the apoptotic pathway, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor proteins, p53 and p21 get down-regulated after DMH treatment which were reverted back to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> and Dolastatin 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, cells having high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential had been seen to increase to significant levels which were reduced after the administration of these <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In silico molecular docking studies also showed that Dolastatin 15 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> may bind to the active site pocket of Bcl(2) , thus revealing the direct target of Dolastatin 15 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> apart from binding to COX-2. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
