<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of yiqi zhuyu decoction (YZD) combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> plus 5-flurouracil/leucovorin (FOLFOX-4) in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (MCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 120 patients with MCRC were randomly divided into the experimental group (FOLFOX-4 plus YZD, 60 cases) and the control group (FOLFOX-4 plus placebo, 60 cases), according to the sequence of hospitalization from January 2005 to December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment was supposed to be continued until disease progression (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) or for 48 weeks (i.e., up to 24 cycles of FOLFOX-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RR was 41.5% in the experimental group and 34.0% in the control group [odds ratio (OR): 1.18, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.82, P=0.432] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median PFS were 9.0 months and 8.0 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR): 0.78, 95% CI: 0.53 to 1.15, P=0.215] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median OS were 21.0 months and 18.0 months (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.99, P=0.043) and grade 3/4 AEs were 56.6% and 76.7% (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.87, P=0.020), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: YZD combined with FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy significantly improved OS in this first-line trial in the patients with MCRC and significantly decreased grade 3/4 AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, RR was not improved, and PFS did not reach statistical significance by the addition of YZD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment of YZD combined with FOLFOX-4 may be necessary in order to optimize efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
