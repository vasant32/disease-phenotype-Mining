<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSES: We focused on the possible benefits of laparoscopic surgery to protect against isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (ITC) generated by surgical manipulation in comparison to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed conventional open surgery and laparoscopic surgery for 25 and 8 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the presence of ITC in the peripheral blood (PB) immediately after surgery via quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for a representative epithelial marker, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 25 patients who underwent open surgery, 8 of the 10 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were positive for ITC in PB, while 13 of the 15 cases without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were negative for ITC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we validated that there was a significant clinical usefulness for the detection of ITC in the prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p = 0.0024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We limited our subsequent analysis to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases with a Dukes stage of B or C to avoid differences due to the background, and we found that the positive ITC rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was higher in the 19 patients who underwent open surgery (42.1 %) than in the 8 who underwent laparoscopic surgery (37.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The short observation period, especially in the laparoscopic surgery group, and the inadequate number of cases limit the ability to draw any definitive conclusions; however, laparoscopic surgery appears to minimize the surgical manipulation, thus leading to reduced ITC from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with open surgery </plain></SENT>
