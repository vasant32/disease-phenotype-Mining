<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 230 samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were analyzed for KRAS exon 1 and 2 and for BRAF exon 15 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA from paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sections was analyzed using microdissection, direct sequencing analysis and allelic separation by cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutations were present in 44.3% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation frequency at hot-spot codons of exon 1 was 84.2%, whereas non-canonical variants had a frequency of 11.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately 4% of the cases exhibited concomitant variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutations were present in 3.9% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that sequential microdissection, direct sequencing and allelic separation by cloning may improve the approach to mutational analysis of KRAS and BRAF in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
