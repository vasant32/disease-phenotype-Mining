<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Lifestyle factors and environmental exposures might help explain the risk of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in countries where the incidence is low, but unique patterns of young <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and a high proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained detailed lifestyle information from 421 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 439 hospital-controls in Egypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were computed to evaluate the risk factors of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A history of <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure and more frequently eating food directly from farms were significantly associated with a higher risk of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.1-5.9, and odds ratio = 4.6; 95% CI = 1.5-14.6, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parous women who reported 7 or more live births or breastfed for 19 months or longer per live birth had a significantly lower risk for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (odds ratio = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.2-0.7, and odds ratio = 0.2; 95% CI = 0.1-0.4, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients aged 40 years or older, industrial exposures were more common in younger patients (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Agricultural and industrial exposures were associated with increased risk of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, whereas prolonged lactation and increased parity were inversely associated with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further research to elucidate the biological role of intense environmental and industrial exposures and reproductive factors including lactation may further clarify the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
