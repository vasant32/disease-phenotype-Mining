<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The endothelium plays a pivotal role in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and is considered a highly relevant target for therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it emerges that current clinical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> inhibitors that act through inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived growth factors are prone to inducing drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> endothelial cells (ECs) themselves provide attractive novel therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a screen for markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, we recently identified high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), known to act as proinflammatory cytokine and chromatin-binding molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report on the role of HMGB1 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> by showing that its overexpression is associated with an increased angiogenic potential of ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HMGB1 stimulates the expression of players in vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor signaling, both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we show that HMGB1 triggers and helps to sustain this proangiogenic gene expression program in ECs, additionally characterized by increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases, integrins and nuclear factor-ÎºB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that HMGB1 is involved in several autocrine and/or paracrine feedback mechanisms resulting in positive enforcement of HMGB1 expression, and that of its receptors, RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interference in HMGB1 expression and/or function using knockdown approaches and antibody-mediated targeting to break this vicious circle resulted in inhibited migration and sprouting of ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using different in vivo models, therapeutic efficacy of HMGB1 targeting was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>First, we demonstrated induction of HMGB1 expression in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) neovasculature following both photodynamic therapy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We subsequently showed that anti-HMGB1 antibodies inhibited vessel density in both models, accompanied by a reduced vascular expression of angiogenic growth factor receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data identify HMGB1 as an important modulator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and suggest the feasibility of targeting HMGB1 for multi-level <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
