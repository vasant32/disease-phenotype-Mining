<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HBOC caused by inherited mutations of BRCA1/2 and HNPCC caused by mismatch-repair genes are considered responsible for about 65 to 75% and 10 to 15% of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Germline mutations of BRCA1 are considered responsible for about 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> families and 80% of breast-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BRCA2 mutations are less common than BRCA1 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of serous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> at an advanced stage has been reported with BRCA-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e> in several studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is controversial whether BRCA-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> patients carry a better prognosis despite the aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-pathological characteristics of their disease, compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a good therapeutic response may be attributable to <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recently in Japan, gene testing of BRCA1/2 has been available as a routine clinical test for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because the mutation spectrum of BRCA1/2 in Japanese was different from that of non-Ashkenazi individuals, the clinical application of BRCA1/2 gene testing for Japanese has been advocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately 1-5% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> patients in Japan are thought to have a family history of breast and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of deleterious mutations of BRCA1/2 in Japanese was reportedly significantly higher than that of non-Ashkenazi individuals despite the low frequency of familial cases in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the age at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e> with BRCA1/2 mutation in the United States was earlier than those of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases, there were no differences among Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that clinical and genetic aspects of BRCA-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> of the Japanese are different from those of Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A serious issue in this field is how the results will lead to a basis for the clinical application of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention strategy targeting BRCA mutation carriers in Japanese </plain></SENT>
