<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the clinical value of methylation of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) for the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and for the survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LINE-1 methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA was measured by quantitative methylation-specific PCR in 155 samples of stage II and stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of microsatellite instability and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) were assessed and 131 microsatellite stable/CIMP- cases were selected for survival analysis, of which 77 patients had received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines were used to investigate possible mechanistic links between LINE-1 methylation and effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High LINE-1 methylation was a marker for better prognosis in patients treated by surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with low LINE-1 methylation who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy survived longer than those treated by surgery alone, suggestive of a survival benefit from the use of oral fluoropyrimidines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a survival benefit from chemotherapy was not observed for patients with high LINE-1 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines treated with 5-FU showed increased expression of LINE-1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was associated with upregulation of the phospho-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2A.X in cells with low LINE-1 methylation, but not in cells with high LINE-1 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-FU-mediated induction of phospho-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2A.X, a marker of DNA damage, was inhibited by knockdown of LINE-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that LINE-1 methylation is a novel predictive marker for survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidines in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding could be important for achieving personalized chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
