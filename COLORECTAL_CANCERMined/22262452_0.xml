<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1996 to 2001, 1,054 patients with primary single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> underwent curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven hundred sixteen patients received various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, including oral and intravenous treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chemotherapy-related parameters examined included therapeutic duration, frequency, route of administration, composition of combination therapies, and postoperative time interval from the operation to the start of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The therapeutic duration and postoperative time interval of starting therapy were independent prognostic factors, in addition to clinicopathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 8-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific/overall survival rates in patients who received chemotherapy for &gt;4 months (63.0/58.6%) were significantly higher than the rates in patients who received no chemotherapy (56.7/37.7%, P &lt; 0.01) and those who remained on chemotherapy for 1-4 months (49.4/41.9%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 8-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific/overall survival rates in patients who waited 1-5 weeks after surgery to receive chemotherapy (62.9/58.5%) were significantly higher versus rates in those who did not receive chemotherapy (56.7/37.7%) and those who did not receive chemotherapy until &gt;5 weeks after surgery (52.3/45.9%) (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival rates did not differ between patients who did not undergo chemotherapy, those for whom chemotherapy lasted 1-4 months, and patients who did not receive chemotherapy until &gt;5 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The appropriate duration of therapy and early chemotherapy after surgery were 2 of the most important factors in eradicating occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and effecting long-term survival benefits in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
