<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is one of the miRNAs that are frequently and highly overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients; however, only a little is known about its functional role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the expression level of miR-21 in 44 paired samples of tumoral and non-tumoral colon tissues diagnosed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using TaqMan real-time PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we used miR-21 inhibitor (anti-miR-21) to transient knockdown of miR-21 in DLD-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells and examined the effects of miR-21 silencing on viability, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, chemosensitivity, cell cycle, and migration of DLD1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-21 were significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in miR-21 levels were observed also between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in different clinical stages: I vs. II (P = 0.033) and I vs. IV (P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis proved that the miR-21 expression levels are correlated to shorter overall survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (P = 0.0341) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MiR-21 silencing in DLD1 cell line had no effect on the cell viability; however, when combined with chemotherapeutics (5-FU, L-OHP, and SN38), it contributed to the decrease of cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Suppression of miR-21 decreased cell migration ability of DLD-1 cells by nearly 30 % (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have confirmed the overexpression of miR-21 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples and its correlation with advanced disease and shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings could be described in part by the fact that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells with increased expression of miR-21 have higher migration ability </plain></SENT>
