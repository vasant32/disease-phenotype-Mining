<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this translational study, we aimed to assess the mutation frequencies of the EGFR (hotspot area and polyadenine deletions A13_del), KRAS, BRAF(V600E), and PIK3CA oncogenes in a series of 280 CRC patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We verified multiple associations between oncogenic mutations and determined clinicopathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> features (1) EGFR A13_deletions are associated with right colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (P&lt;0.005), mucinous histotype (P=0.042), G3 grading (P=0.024), and MSI status (P&lt;0.005); (2) PIK3CA mutations are related mucinous histotype (P=0.021); (3) KRAS(G12) and KRAS(G13) mutations are correlated, respectively, with the left and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> development (P&lt;0.005), and finally (4) MSI is associated with right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mostly, we verified a higher frequency rate of the KRAS(G13) and EGFR A13_del oncogene mutations in right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>; whereas KRAS(G12) codon mutation occurs more frequently in left <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
