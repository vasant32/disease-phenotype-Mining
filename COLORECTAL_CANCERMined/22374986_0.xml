<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is believed that antibodies are too large to routinely enter the cytosol, thus antibody therapeutic approach has been limited to extracellular or secreted proteins expressed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, many oncogenic proteins are localized within the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explore the possibility of antibody therapies against intracellular targets, we generated a chimeric antibody targeting the intracellular PRL-3 oncoprotein to assess its antitumor activities in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, we observed that the PRL-3 chimeric antibody could efficiently and specifically reduce the formation of PRL-3 expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further found that natural killer (NK) cells were important in mediating the therapeutic effect, which was only observed in a <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse model (T-cell deficient), but not in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>Severe Combined Immunodeficiency</z:hpo>' (scid ) mouse model (B- and T-cell deficient), indicating the anticancer effect also depends on host B-cell activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study involving 377 <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> and scid mice suggest that antibodies targeting intracellular proteins can be developed to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
