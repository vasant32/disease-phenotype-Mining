<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a joint analysis of multiple genes and environmental factors is challenging, owing to potentially large numbers of correlated and complex variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe Bayesian generalized linear models for simultaneously analyzing covariates, main effects of numerous loci, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in population case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our Bayesian models use Student-t prior distributions with different shrinkage parameters for different types of effects, allowing reliable estimates of main effects and interactions and hence increasing the power for detection of real signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We implement a fast and stable algorithm for fitting models by extending available tools for classical generalized linear models to the Bayesian case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose a novel method to interpret and visualize models with multiple interactions by computing the average predictive probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simulations show that the method has the potential to dissect interacting networks of complex diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Application of the method to a large case-control study of adiponectin genes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk highlights the previous results and detects new epistatic interactions and sex-specific effects that warrant follow-up in independent studies </plain></SENT>
