<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 3'-untranslated regions of genes could affect the binding between a microRNA (miRNA) and its target, with consequences on gene expression regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering the important role of miRNAs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, it is hypothesized here that these SNPs could also affect the individual risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To test this hypothesis, a list was developed of 140 somatically mutated genes deduced from previous works on the mutome of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A further selection was conducted of SNPs within target sites for miRNAs that are expressed only in the colorectum (the colorectal microRNAome) and having adequate population frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This yielded 12 SNPs that were genotyped in a case-control association study on 717 colorectal cases and 1171 controls from the Czech Republic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant associations were found between the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the variant alleles of KIAA0182 (rs709805) (odds ratio = 1.57; 95% confidence interval = 1.06-2.78, for the variant homozygotes) and NUP210 genes (rs354476) (odds ratio = 1.36; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.82, for the variant homozygotes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results support the study hypothesis and highlight the importance of SNPs within miRNA-dependent regulatory regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies on the role exerted by NUP210 and KIAA0182 in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> are warranted </plain></SENT>
