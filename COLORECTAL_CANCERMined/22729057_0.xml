<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A food frequency questionnaire was used to collect information on the dietary intake and patterns of patients who had undergone surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Auckland region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary intakes were compared to the Ministry of Health Food and Nutrition Guidelines for Adult New Zealanders (FNG-MoH) along with other publications of dietary patterns in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were also asked to report on what dietary information they received and their satisfaction with this information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty participants completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven percent and 50% of participants met the recommended daily servings of fruit and vegetables respectively in the FNG-MoH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four distinct dietary patterns were described for the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 50% of participants indicated that they did not receive any dietary information after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We were able to collect dietary information from this patient group, and this demonstrated that a significant proportion of the study population did not meet the FNG-MoH guidelines for recommended daily fruit and vegetable servings, and that there is an unmet information need in this patient group </plain></SENT>
