<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review discusses current screening guidelines in the United States and other countries, data on the magnitude of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the presence of a family history and the efficacy of recommended screening programs, as well as ancillary issues such as compliance, cost-effectiveness and accuracy of family history ascertainment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We focus on the relatively common "<z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>" family histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which typically imparts a mild to moderate elevation in the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development in the proband </plain></SENT>
