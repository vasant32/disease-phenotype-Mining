<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenol</z:chebi> compounds from green tea possess anticancer activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, systemic evaluation was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemopreventive potentials of 10 representative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36281">caffeic acid</z:chebi>, CA; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30778">gallic acid</z:chebi>, GA; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi>, C; epicatechin, EC; gallocatechin, GC; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi>, CG; gallocatechin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi>, GCG; epicatechin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi>, ECG; epigallocatechin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e>; and epigallocatechin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>), and explored their structure-activity relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of the 10 polyphenol compounds on the proliferation of HCT-116 and SW-480 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells was evaluated using an MTS assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle distribution and apoptotic effects were analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI)/RNase or annexin V/PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 polyphenols, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> showed the most potent antiproliferative effects, and significantly induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the relationship between chemical structure and anticancer activity was examined, C and EC did not show antiproliferative effects, and GA showed some antiproliferative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When C and EC esterified with GA to produce CG and ECG, the antiproliferative effects were increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar relationship was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30778">gallic acid</z:chebi> group significantly enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi>'s anticancer potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This property could be utilized in future semi-synthesis of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> derivatives to develop novel anticancer agents </plain></SENT>
