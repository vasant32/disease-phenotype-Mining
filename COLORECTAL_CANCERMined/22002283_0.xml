<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In laparoscopic colon resection for rectosigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, minilaparotomy is usually necessary for specimen retrieval and completion of primary anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This incision may increase postoperative pain, and cause wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or other complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a new technique of laparoscopic anterior colon resection without requiring a minilaparotomy incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We attempted this procedure on 9 patients with sigmoid colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We ligated the inferior mesenteric artery and divided the bowel proximally, similar to conventional laparoscopic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We pulled out the specimen and the rectum transanally, and performed distal colon division extracorporeally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An anvil was inserted transanally into corporeal cavity and then, inserted into the proximal stump of the colon lumen laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We placed a purse-string suture extracorporeally around the distal colon stump, and then completed a side-to-end anastomosis intracorporeally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure was successfully completed in 8 of the 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median operative time was 293 minutes and median blood loss was 47.2 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No major complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel technique of transanal specimen retrieval and intracorporeal anastomosis with extracorporeal purse-string placement can be performed safely and easily in patients with rectosigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
