<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present functional and clinical data of a broadly important role for SOX9 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SOX9 was overexpressed in a wide range of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, where its expression correlated with malignant character and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gain of SOX9 copy number is detected in some primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SOX9 exhibited several pro-oncogenic properties, including the ability to promote proliferation, inhibit senescence, and collaborate with other oncogenes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In primary mouse embryo fibroblasts and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, SOX9 expression facilitated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and progression whereas its inactivation reduced tumorigenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, we have found that Sox9 directly binds and activates the promoter of the polycomb Bmi1, whose upregulation represses the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor Ink4a/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Arf</z:e> locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this, human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> showed a positive correlation between expression levels of SOX9 and BMI1 and a negative correlation between SOX9 and ARF in clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings provide direct mechanistic evidence of the involvement of SOX9 in neoplastic pathobiology, particularly, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
