<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of imaging in cases of PC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective single-institution study which examined 23 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT) and received a final diagnosis PC in our institute between 2005 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PET/CT detected PC in 19 of 23 cases (82.6%), whereas CT detected PC in 6 of 20 cases (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four cases of PC were FDG-negative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with maximal size &lt;10mm, representing smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FDG-negative PC was diffuse in 3 cases and nodular in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distributed spotty uptake of FDG-negative PC was harder to detect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic detection of PC was only achieved in 3 of 23 cases (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining cases, clinical diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastasis to lymph nodes</z:e>, recurrence, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FDG uptake by intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT offers efficient detection of PC and has the potential to improve clinical diagnosis when coupled with an understanding of the pathways of flow for ascitic fluid and peritoneal seeding </plain></SENT>
