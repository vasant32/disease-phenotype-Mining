<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six patients with unresectable or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who were treated with first-line chemotherapy combined bevacizumab with S-1 or 5FU/LV (modified Roswell Park Memorial Institute regimen) at our hospital between October 2007 and December 2010 were retrospectively investigated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were with resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> and 6 were without, 8 were with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and 18 were without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of metastasized organs was 1, 2 and 3 in 17, 9 and 0 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The liver, lung, lymph node and peritoneum were metastasized in 9, 9, 11 and 5 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The KRAS gene was wild in 11, mutated in 7 and unknown in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab with S-1 was used in 17 patients and bevacizumab with 5FU/LV was used in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Response and disease control rates were 50 and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median duration of progression-free survival was 9.1 months and the median time to treatment failure was 9.0 months </plain></SENT>
