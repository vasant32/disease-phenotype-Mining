<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Abdominal surgery with bowel resection through a midline or transverse incision is performed in most cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both incisions affect abdominal wall function and may lead to differences in postoperative clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although postoperative isometric trunk flexion strength (ITFS) has previously been investigated, the results were based on measurement tools distinguished by poor reproducibility and validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reproducibility of and variations in ITFS following abdominal surgery using a dynamometer and explore the correlation between ITFS and the scar length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The study group consisted of 22 consecutive patients (15 men and 7 women) referred for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome parameters included ITFS which was measured using a fixed dynamometer and a digital manometer, scar length, weight and pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Test-retest measurement (3 h apart) of ITFS was taken 1 day before surgery to determine the instruments' reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional measurements of the outcome parameters were taken 1 and 6 weeks postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Excellent test-retest correlations (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> &gt; 0.85) coupled with low standard error of the measurement for both the ITFS and the manometric findings indicated clinically acceptable reproducibility of the findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant pre- and postoperative differences in ITFS were noted using both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six weeks postoperatively, fair and significant correlations were noted between the dynamometry-based ITFS and both the scar length (r = 0.452) and age (r = 0.498) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of note, scar length and preoperative dynamometric ITFS predicted ITFS 6 weeks postoperatively (F = 102.949, p &lt; 0.001, R (2) = 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of ITFS using dynamometry in elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients are reproducible, sensitive to clinical changes and allow prediction of postoperative ITFS scores based on their preoperative counterparts </plain></SENT>
