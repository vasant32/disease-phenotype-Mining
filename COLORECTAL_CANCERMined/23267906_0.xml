<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old man suffering from sigmoid colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and unresectable multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the seventh course, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reduction was confirmed but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> meant that it was difficult to continue the same regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because preoperative evaluation of liver function showed a high risk of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo>, a combination of partial hepatectomy and RFA was planned in order to reduce the amount of liver resection </plain></SENT>
