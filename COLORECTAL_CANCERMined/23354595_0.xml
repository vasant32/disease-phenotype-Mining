<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to investigate associations between pain sites and specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and investigate the hypothesis that musculoskeletal pain is an early marker, rather than cause, of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was a cohort study in the General Practice Research Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a cohort of 46,656 people aged â‰¥50 years with a recorded musculoskeletal problem in 1996 but not during the previous 2 years, patients with a new consultation for back, neck, shoulder or hip pain in 1996 were selected and compared with 39,253 persons who had had no musculoskeletal consultation between 1994 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was incidence of prostate, breast, lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> up to 10 years after baseline consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strongest associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> were in the first year of follow-up for males consulting initially with back (adjusted hazard ratio 5.42; 95% CI 3.31, 8.88), hip (6.08; 2.87, 12.85) or neck problems (3.46; 1.58, 7.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations remained for back and neck problems over 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant associations existed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> up to 5 years after consultation in females with hip problems, and with breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in the first year after presentation with back problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previously observed links between pain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> reflect specific associations between pain sites and certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One explanation is liability for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bony metastases</z:e> from primary sites, and that pain represents a potential early marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, older patients with uncomplicated musculoskeletal pain seen in clinical practice have a low absolute excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
