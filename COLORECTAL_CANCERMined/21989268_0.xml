<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify the proteins involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) resistance, a comparison of the total and phosphorylated proteins between the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell line DLD-1 and its 5-FU-resistant subclone DLD-1/5-FU was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF-based proteomics, 17 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated protein spots were identified in the 5-FU-resistant DLD-1/5-FU cells compared with the parent cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In DLD-1/5-FU cells, 7 anti-apoptotic proteins (HSPB1, proteasome subunit α-5, transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, 14-3-3 β, 14-3-3 γ, 14-3-3 σ, and phosphoglycerate kinase 1) were up-regulated and 4 proapoptotic proteins (cofilin-1, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase M2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, and nucleophosmin) were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results show that the acquired drug resistance of DLD-1/5-FU cells is caused by the prevention of drug-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, in particular through the enhanced constitutive expression of HSPB1 and its phosphorylated form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> knockdown of endogenous HSPB1 in DLD-1/5-FU cells restored the sensitivity to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MALDI-TOF/TOF and 2-DE Western blot analysis identified the phosphorylated residues of HSPB1 as Ser-15 and Ser-82 in the main (diphosphorylated) form and Ser-15, Ser-78, and Ser-82 in the minor (triphosphorylated) form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current findings indicate that phosphorylated HSPB1 may play an important role in 5-FU resistance </plain></SENT>
