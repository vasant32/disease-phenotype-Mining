<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, studies have reported improved survival with increasing numbers of retrieved lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings are puzzling, as increased node sampling was not correlated with significant change in disease staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the physiologic processes underlying this correlation between number of lymph nodes sampled and survival remain unknown, the reported correlation has caused modifications to clinical and non-clinical practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we review the literature and discuss potential etiologies responsible for the observed increased survival statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Literature regarding colorectal lymph node <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, molecular aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics and utilization of lymph node sample numbers are evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we present the mathematical concepts available for probabilistic prediction of diagnostic confidence based upon sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From evaluation of the aggregate literature, certain facts emerge which are not easily identified within the individual studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> appears to encompass a number of individual disease entities with different physiologic characteristics and likelihoods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, it appears the improved survival is likely multifactorial including effects from intrinsic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-host interactions along with ever changing clinical practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, because lymph node count is dependent on a number of variables and is correlated, but unlikely to be causally associated with survival, use of this number as a quality indicator is unwarranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on statistical considerations, the current recommended goal of 12-15 recovered lymph nodes without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> provides approximately 80% negative predictive value for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
