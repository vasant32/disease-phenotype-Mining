<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A proportion of MSH2 and MLH1 mutations found in suspected LS patients give rise to single amino acid substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The functional consequences in regard to pathogenicity of many of these variants are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined the functionality of a panel of MLH1 missense mutations found in LS families, by testing the variant proteins in functional assays, addressing subcellular localization, and protein-protein interaction with the dimer partner PMS2 and the MMR-associated exonuclease 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that a significant proportion of examined variant proteins have functional defects in either subcellular localization or protein-protein interactions, which is suspected to lead to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> phenotype observed in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the obtained results correlate well with reported MMR activity and with in silico analysis for a majority of the variants </plain></SENT>
