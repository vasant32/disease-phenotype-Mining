<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed comparative proteome analysis of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines HCT-116 and its metastatic derivative E1 using 2-D DIGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 74 differentially expressed proteins, many of which function in transcription, translation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> signal transduction, or cytoskeletal remodeling pathways, which are indispensable cellular processes involved in the metastatic cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these proteins, stathmin-1 (STMN1) was found to be highly up-regulated in E1 as compared to HCT-116 and was thus selected for further functional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that perturbations in STMN1 levels resulted in significant changes in cell migration, invasion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further showed that the differential expression of STMN1 correlated with the cells' metastatic potential in other paradigms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry, we also showed that STMN1 was highly expressed in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> and metastatic tissues as compared to the adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also showed via tissue microarray analyses of 324 CRC tissues and Kaplan-Meier survival plot that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with higher expression of STMN1 have poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
