<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis revealed that the efficacy of cetuximab was similar in mCRC patients negative (EGFR-) and positive for EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the efficacy of cetuximab has not been assessed prospectively in EGFR- mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter phase II study assessed the efficacy and safety of biweekly cetuximab (500 mg/m(2)) and irinotecan (150-180 mg/m(2)) in patients with histologically proven <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with WT-KRAS and measurable lesion(s), either EGFR + or EGFR-, determined immunohistochemically, who failed first-line irinotecan-containing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was response rate (RR), and the secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled; 20 EGFR + and 20 EGFR-; their baseline characteristics were balanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall RR was 45% (18/40, 95% CI 29.6-60.4), 55% (11/20) in EGFR + and 35% (7/20) in EGFR- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 7.1 months (95% CI 4.8-9.4), 8.3 months in EGFR + and 4.9 months in EGFR- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median OS was 18.5 months (95% CI 15.2-21.8), 17.2 months in EGFR + and 18.5 months in EGFR- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or 4 toxicities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 5 patients (12.5%) and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>/asthenia in 2 (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Biweekly cetuximab plus irinotecan as second-line treatment showed significant anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity in patients with irinotecan-refractory mCRC and WT-KRAS regardless of EGFR expression status </plain></SENT>
