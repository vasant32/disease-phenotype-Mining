<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a very useful endoscopic technique, making it possible to perform en bloc resection regardless of lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the introduction of ESD at our hospital, we have performed 1,000 colorectal ESDs during 56 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of our colorectal ESD experience and to access the efficacy and safety of colorectal ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 2006 and August 2011, we performed ESD on 1,000 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> in 966 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> said cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 24.1 Â± 13.3 (3-145) mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our overall endoscopic en bloc resection rate was 97.5% (975/1,000), and our R0 resection rate was 91.2% (912/1,000) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate was 5.3% (53/1,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 53 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath>, 50 cases were treated through conservative management with/without endoscopic clipping, whereas the remaining 3 patients received laparoscopic operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination showed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 37.2% of cases (372/1,000) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_366'>neuroendocrine tumors</z:mpath> in 11.2% (112/1,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommended additional radical surgery to 82 patients who had a risk of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up colonoscopies were performed on 722 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the median follow-up period of 13 (1-62) months, there were three recurrences (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ESD is technically difficult, with a substantial risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, ESD enabled en bloc resection and pathologically complete resection of large colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205853" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">epithelial tumors</z:e> and submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As experience with the technique increases, ESD may gradually replace piecemeal endoscopic mucosal resection and radical colon resection in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
