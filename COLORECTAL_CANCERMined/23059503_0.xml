<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: The aim of this study was to delineate the impact of smoking on postoperative outcomes after colorectal resection for malignant and benign processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Studies to date have implicated smoking as a risk factor for increased postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is a paucity of data on the effects of smoking after colorectal surgery and in particular for malignant compared with benign processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: The American College of Surgeon's National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (2005-2010) database was queried for patients undergoing elective major colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk-adjusted 30-day outcomes were assessed and compared between patient cohorts identified as never-smokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes of incisional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, infectious and major complications, and mortality were evaluated using regression modeling adjusting for patient characteristics and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: A total of 47,574 patients were identified, of which 26,333 had surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 14,019 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e>, and 7222 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than 60% of patients had never smoked, 20.4% were current smokers, and 19.2% were ex-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, current smokers were at a significantly increased risk of postoperative morbidity [odds ratio (OR), 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21-1.40] and mortality (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.11-1.94) after colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding persisted across malignant and benign diagnoses and also demonstrated a significant dose-dependent effect when stratifying by pack-years of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Smoking increases the risk of complications after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of major colorectal surgery, with the greatest risk apparent for current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A concerted effort should be made toward promoting smoking cessation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients scheduled for elective colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
