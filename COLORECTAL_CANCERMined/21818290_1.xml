<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: SPARC is a matricellular protein involved in tissue remodelling, cell migration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, while forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) protein functions as a transcription factor involved in immune cell regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both SPARC and FOXP3 can play an anti-tumorigenic role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e>. The aim was to determine if SPARC, FOXP3, CD8 and CD45RO expression levels are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) stage, disease outcome and long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (CSS) in stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: SPARC expression was initially assessed in 120 paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and stage I-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, approximately 1000 paired patient samples of stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> in tissue microarrays were stained for SPARC, FOXP3, CD8 or CD45RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazards modelling assessed correlations between these markers and clinicopathological data, including disease outcome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specific survival (CSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both SPARC and FOXP3 expression were significantly greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High SPARC expression correlated with good disease outcome (≥60 mths without disease recurrence, p = 0.0039) and better long-term CSS in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, high SPARC expression correlated with better long-term CSS (p&lt;0.0001) and less adjuvant chemotherapy use (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High FOXP3 correlated with a good disease outcome, better long-term CSS and less adjuvant chemotherapy use in stage II (p&lt;0.0037, &lt;0.0001 and p = 0.04 respectively), but not in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High CD8 and CD45RO expression correlated with better disease outcome in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and better CSS, but the differences were not as marked as for SPARC and FOXP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that high SPARC and FOXP3 are associated with better disease outcome in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and may be prognostic indicators of CSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further assessment of whether these markers predict patients at high risk of recurrence with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and functional studies of these effects are underway </plain></SENT>
