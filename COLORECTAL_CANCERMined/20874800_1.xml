<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Recent reports show that a positive metastatic to examined lymph nodes ratio (LNR) has prognostic value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of LNR in patients having resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: From January 2000 to December 2006, patients who underwent resection for stage III colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinicopathological and follow-up data were prospectively collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of LNR and other clinicopathological factors on survival were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 533 (52.3% male) patients with a median age of 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of lymph nodes harvested and the median number of positive lymph nodes examined were 11 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median LNR was 0.263 (range, 0.03-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median follow up of 52.65 months, the 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 55.9% and 49.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients were stratified into four groups according to LNR quartiles (1, LNR ≤ 0.125; 2, 0.125&lt;LNR≤0.263; 3, 0.263&lt;LNR≤0.500; 4, LNR&gt;0.500) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 72.8%, 63.1%, 50.0%, 39.6% (P&lt;0.001) and 68.5%, 54.1%, 47.2%, 29.9% (P&lt;0.001), respectively, with increasing LNR groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, age, T stage and LNR were independent predictors of both overall and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis revealed that the LNR had a prognostic value for disease-free survival irrespective of number of lymph nodes harvested and location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The LNR is an independent prognostic factor for survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and is superior to the pN category in TNM staging </plain></SENT>
