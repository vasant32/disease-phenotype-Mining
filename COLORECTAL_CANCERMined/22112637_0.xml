<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By improvement of optical design in laser pulse generator, wavelength-adjustable output was acquired and the optimal wavelength was defined as 380 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With 380-nm pulsed laser excitation, AF spectra of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, benign and malignant colorectal tissues were recorded in the spectra region from 460-570 nm in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spectral analysis for discrimination among the different types of tissues was carried out using principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>)-based Neural networks algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The performance of analysis was pretty good with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy found to be 100%,90% and 96.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AF spectroscopy may serve as an excellent tool for the evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in colorectal clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
