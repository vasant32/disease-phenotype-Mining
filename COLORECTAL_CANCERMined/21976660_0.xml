<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the results achieved with a rapid referral pathway for suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), comparing with the standard referral pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three-year audit of patients suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> routed via a rapid referral pathway, and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> routed via the standard referral pathway of a health care district serving a population of 498,000 in Madrid (Spain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included referral criteria met, waiting times, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosed and stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-two patients (mean age 68.8 years, SD 14.0; 51% male) were routed via the rapid referral pathway for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine per cent of referrals fulfilled the criteria for high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were diagnosed: 26% Stage A (Astler-Coller), 36% Stage B, 24% Stage C and 14% Stage D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average waiting time to colonoscopy for the rapid referral patients was 18.5 days (SD 19.1) and average waiting time to surgery was 28.6 days (SD 23.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was performed within 15 days in 65% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> rapid referral patients compared to 43% of standard pathway patients (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall waiting time for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the rapid referral pathway was 52.7 days (SD 32.9); while for those in the standard pathway, it was 71.5 days (SD 57.4) (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six per cent Stage A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was diagnosed in the rapid referral pathway compared to 12% in the standard pathway (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rapid referral pathway reduced waiting time to colonoscopy and overall waiting time to final treatment and appears to be an effective strategy for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in its early stages </plain></SENT>
