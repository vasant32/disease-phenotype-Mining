<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed young patients (≤ 40 years of age) with advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (n=84) between January 1996 and December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We randomly selected the control group as patients ≥ 50 years of age with advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (n=84) during the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, the MSI test and MLH1 immunohistochemistry were performed in the available tissue samples from patients with advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of patients who had the two tests was 52 in the young group and 49 in the old group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The monomorphic nature of the BAT26 panel for MSI analysis was used without comparison of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSI was detected in three young patients (n=52) and none of the old patients (n=49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between the two groups (P=0.243) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three young patients with MSI had a strong family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MSI analysis was not a useful method of screening for HNPCC in young patients with advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, at least in cases without a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
