<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various chemopreventive compounds alter gene expression, possibly explaining their biological activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One gene induced by a variety of chemopreventive compounds is the one coding for the transcription factor activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed microarray analysis on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isolated from human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells overexpressing ATF3 to ascertain the biological activity of this gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, 64 genes were induced or repressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One gene identified by microarray analysis as repressed by overexpression of ATF3 was inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation-1 (Id1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Id1 is important to cell growth and proliferation and therefore may represent an important downstream target of ATF3 responsible for the biological activity of ATF3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Id1 interacts with ATF3, thereby sequestering its activity, making it an ideal candidate for further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induction of ATF3 and repression of Id1 in these cells were confirmed at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine if the repression of Id1 seen following microarray analysis of these cells occurred following treatment with dietary compounds with known chemotherapeutic activity, human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi>, and their expression was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result, ATF3 was induced, and Id1 was repressed, by these compounds and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15138">sulfide</z:chebi>, a positive control, at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed to determine the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the regulation of Id1 and to determine if biological activity of ATF3 overexpression is mediated by repression of Id1 by these compounds </plain></SENT>
