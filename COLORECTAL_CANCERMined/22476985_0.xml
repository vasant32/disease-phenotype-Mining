<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate informed decision making (IDM) elements about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among low-income minority patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational data were collected as part of a patient-level randomized controlled trial to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical visits (November 2007 to May 2010) were audio-taped and coded for IDM elements about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Near the end of the study one provider refused recording of patients' visits (33 of 270 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the trial, agreement to be audio taped was 43.5 % (103/237) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluable patient (n = 100) visits were assessed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussion occurrence, IDM elements, and who initiated discussion of each IDM element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Patients were African American (72.2 %), female (63.7 %), with annual household incomes &lt;$20,000 (60.7 %), without health insurance (57.0 %), and limited health literacy (53.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was mentioned during 48 (48 %) visits, no further discussion about screening occurred in 23 visits (19 times mentioned by the participant with no response from providers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During any visit, the maximum number of IDM elements was five; however, only two visits included five elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common IDM element discussed in addition to the nature of the decision was the assessment of the patient's understanding in 16 (33.3 %) of the visits that included a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A patient activation intervention initiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussions with health care providers; however, limited IDM occurred about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening during medical visits of minority and low-income patients </plain></SENT>
