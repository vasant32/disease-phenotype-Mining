<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Synchronous and multiple metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> were detected in 57 patients since May 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our treatment policy was to perform hepatectomy if the resection could be done with no limit on size and number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, if curative resection could not be done, chemotherapy was begun and timing for the possibility of a radical operation was planned immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 37 patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were located only in the liver, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection was performed in 16 patients and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-decreasing by chemotherapy, in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients in whom chemotherapy was performed first, after controlling the distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, hepatectomy was performed in 3 patients and staged hepatectomy was performed in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was detected after hepatectomy in 75.0% of simultaneous resection cases and in 70.0% of staged cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the recurrence cases, early detection after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection occurred in 58.3% of the simultaneous and 14.2% of the staged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present data show that neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not increase the risk of postoperative complications or the surgical difficulties of hepatectomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
