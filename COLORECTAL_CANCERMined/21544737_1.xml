<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Studies investigating the association between genetic polymorphism of cyclin D1 (CCND1) G870A and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) reported conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an extensive search of relevant studies and carried out a meta-analysis, including 20 studies with 5,975 cases and 8,333 controls, to obtain a more precise estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, significantly elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk was associated with variant allele 870A when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies were pooled (AA vs. GG: OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.04-1.44; GA vs. GG: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01-1.26; dominant model: OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03-1.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were detected among Caucasians (AA vs. GG: OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.04-1.44; dominant model: OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.02-1.34).We also observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility (AA vs. GG: OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.04-1.48; dominant model: OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.04-1.33), when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was stratified into <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333990" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no significant associations were found in both Asians and HNPCC patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Result suggests that the cyclin D1 870A allele is a low-penetrant risk factor for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
