<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the impact of red meat consumption on potential risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we investigated the effect of a 7-day dietary red meat intervention in human subjects on endogenous NOC formation and fecal water genotoxicity in relation to genome-wide transcriptomic changes induced in colonic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention showed no effect on fecal NOC excretion but fecal water genotoxicity significantly increased in response to red meat intake </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcriptomic analyses revealed that genes significantly correlating with the increase in fecal water genotoxicity were involved in biological pathways indicative of genotoxic effects, including modifications in DNA damage repair, cell cycle, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, WNT signaling and nucleosome remodeling pathways were modulated which are implicated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the gene expression changes identified in this study corroborate the genotoxic potential of diets high in red meat and point towards a potentially increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in humans </plain></SENT>
