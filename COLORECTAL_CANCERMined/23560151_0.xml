<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of mEUS in patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (ECC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety lesions of ECC underwent mEUS for pre-treatment staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We divided the lesions into either the mucosal group or the submucosal group according to the mEUS findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histological results of the specimens were compared with the mEUS findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall accuracy for assessing the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion (T stage) was 84.4% (76/90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of mEUS was significantly lower for submucosal lesions compared to mucosal lesions (p=0.003) and it was lower for large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (â‰¥2 cm) (p=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> affecting the accuracy of T staging were 3.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 11.39) and 6.25 (95% CI, 1.85 to 25.14), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were combined with large size, the odds ratio was 14.67 (95% CI, 1.46 to 146.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall accuracy of T stage determination with mEUS was considerably high in patients with ECC; however, the accuracy decreased when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was &gt;2 cm or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had invaded the submucosal layer </plain></SENT>
