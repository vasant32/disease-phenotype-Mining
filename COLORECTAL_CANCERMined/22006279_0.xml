<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nonspecific cross-reacting antigen 2 (NCA-2), a truncated CEA species molecule which is transcribed from the same gene, has been suggested as an alternative biomarker to CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present work, specific immunofluorometric assays were used for detection of NCA-2 and full-length CEA in bone marrow plasma from 277 CRC patients to assess their value as prognostic biomarkers, and detection was also performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated plasma CEA was associated with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage at diagnosis and adverse patient outcome, while for NCA-2, although the same trends were observed, no additional prognostic information was gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While specific detection of NCA-2 was clearly achieved in plasma samples, cross-reactivity with full-length CEA was observed when the antigen was exposed to common fixation chemicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results from this study indicate that NCA-2 is probably not a prognostic biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and, furthermore, underline the issue of antibody specificity when investigating CEA species molecules </plain></SENT>
