<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multicellular layer (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) cultures recapitulate barriers to drug penetration and distribution and have been used successfully in the production of clinically relevant data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the characteristics of paclitaxel (PTX) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) penetration and their effects on tissue penetration using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells (DLD-1 and HT-29) grown in Transwell inserts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug concentration in conditioned media after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> penetration was estimated using % survival of cells exposed to the conditioned media, and the penetration rate was calculated as % drug concentration relative to the expected concentration after penetration of cell-free <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PTX showed limited penetration in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> in contrast to the full penetration seen by 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The penetration rate measured after 24 h by cytotoxicity of the conditioned media was 40 and 38% in DLD-1 (20 μM) and HT-29 MCLs (1 μM), respectively, at which concentration the conditioned media produced 50% growth inhibition in monolayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The penetration profile obtained using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-paclitaxel also showed slow and limited penetration with concentration- and cell line-dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In HT-29 MCL, full penetration of PTX was obtained at 10 μM after 48 h, whereas only 80% was obtained at 1 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In DLD-1 MCLs, penetration of PTX was minimal, especially at 1 μM, showing penetration rates as low as 10 and 20% after 24 and 96 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When PTX and 5-FU were allowed to penetrate in sequential combination, no effect on the penetration rate was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results demonstrated limited penetration of PTX in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> along with concentration-, time-, and cell line-dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Assessment of penetration using cytotoxicity of the conditioned media used in the present study may be useful in early stage screening of anticancer agents for their potential in tissue penetration </plain></SENT>
