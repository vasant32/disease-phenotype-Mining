<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Area social deprivation is associated with unfavorable health outcomes of residents across the full clinical course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> from the stage at diagnosis through survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether area social factors are associated with the area health care supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the area supply of health services required for the provision of guideline-recommended care for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in each of the following three distinct clinical domains: screening, treatment, and post-treatment surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We characterized area social factors in 3,096 urban zip code tabulation areas by using Census Bureau data and the health care supply in the corresponding 465 hospital service areas by using American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, and US Food and Drug Administration data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two-level hierarchical models, we assessed associations between social factors and the supply of health services across areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no clear associations between area social factors and the supply of health services essential to the provision of guideline recommended <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> care in urban areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The measures of health service included the supply of physicians who facilitate screening, treatment, and post-treatment care and the supply of facilities required for the same services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because we found that the supply of types of health care required for the provision of guideline-recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> did not vary with markers of area socioeconomic disadvantage, it is possible that previously reported unfavorable <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> outcomes among individuals living in impoverished areas may have occurred despite an apparent adequate area health care supply </plain></SENT>
