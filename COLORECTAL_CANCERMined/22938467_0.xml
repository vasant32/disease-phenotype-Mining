<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire form including information and behavior about colonoscopic screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> of patients and their first-degree relatives (FDRs) was prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 406 CRC patients were enrolled into the study, with 1534 FDRs (siblings n: 1381 and parents n: 153)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive family history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was found in 12% of the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous SC was performed in 11% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the patients whose FDRs underwent SC was lower than the patients whose FDRs did not (52 vs 57 years; p&lt;0,001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of SC in FDRs was 64% in patients diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> under 35 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persons having a positive family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had SC more often (51 vs 22%, p&lt;0,001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FDRs of patients having a higher educational level and income had SC more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is planned, elderly subjects, those with family history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and those with low educational and lower income should be given especial attention in order that they be convinced to undergo screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
