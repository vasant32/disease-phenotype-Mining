<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies on the effect of additional systemic application of bevacizumab (BE), a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor, to SCT showed a slight increase of patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we studied in a rat model of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> whether a locoregional application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (OX) and BE via hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) is more effective to inhibit metastatic growth compared to systemic drug application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten days after implantation of CC531 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells into the left liver lobe of WAG/Rij rats, animals underwent either HAI or systemic intravenous application of BE (5 mg/kg body weight), OX (85 mg/m(2) body surface) or a combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham-treated animals received saline and served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> volume was measured at days 10 and 13 using three dimensional ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At day 13 tumor tissue was analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic application of OX, BE or their combination did not affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HAI of BE and particularly the combination of BE and OX significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue this was associated with a decrease of vascularization and cell proliferation as well as an increase of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as indicated by a decreased number of PECAM-1- and PCNA-positive cells and an increased number of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Locoregional administration of BE, particularly in combination with OX, enhances the inhibitory effect on hepatic metastatic growth compared to systemic application of the drugs </plain></SENT>
