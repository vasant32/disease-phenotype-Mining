<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> during cetuximab treatment at the Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Unit from June 2006 to May 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We divided the general case study into two subgroups: young and elderly patients (≥65 years old), and we compared clinical, pathological, and therapeutical characteristics of both subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 31 patients affected by advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (64.5 % with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 35.5 % with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>) treated with cetuximab, 19 patients (61.3 %) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicities</z:e>: seven patients (36.8 %) had grade 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, nine patients (47.4 %) had grade 2, three patients (15.8 %) had grade 3, and no grade 4 was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten (52.6 %) out of 19 patients were elderly (&gt;65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, grading was substantially comparable between the two subgroups, but median duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> was higher in the first subgroup for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The univariate analysis showed no statistical significant difference in overall survival between young and elderly patients (p = 0.171), such as age that does not seem to statistically influence the appearance (p = 0.386), duration (p = 0.455), and grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> (p = 0.765) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age is an insufficient predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> during cetuximab treatment in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and does not seem to statistically influence the appearance, duration, and grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
