<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Group (DCCG) was established with the aim of improving the prognosis, and in this study we present a survival analysis of patients treated from 1994 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The study was based on the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal Cancer</z:e> Registry and the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Database, supplemented with data from the Central Population Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis included actuarial overall and relative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 10 632 patients were operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival increased from 0.37 in 1994 to 0.51% in 2006; the improvement was greater in men (20% points) than in women (10% points), and greatest in stage III (20% points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative 5-year survival increased from 0.46 to 0.62, including an improvement of 23% points in men and 9% points in women and the greatest in stage III (22% points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis has improved substantially, probably mainly because of initiatives taken by the DCCG, among which implementation of total mesorectal excision, improved staging and centralized treatment are considered most important </plain></SENT>
