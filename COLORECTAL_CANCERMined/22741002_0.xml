<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Ovid, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, EMBASE and conference proceedings for eligible trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,603 cancer patients from 7 trials were analyzed, and the baseline patient characteristics were comparable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Curative effect outcomes including complete response (CR) (OR=0.78; 95% CI 0.47-1.31; p=0.35), partial response (PR) (OR=0.81; 95% CI 0.65-1.00; p=0.05) and the overall response rate (ORR) (OR=0.85; 95% CI 0.71-1.02; p=0.08) showed similar curative effects between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> group and the 5-FU plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) had no statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding safety, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e> was more frequently observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> group (OR=2.71; 95% CI 2.04-3.61; p&lt;0.00001), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> were reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other toxic effects had no statistically significant differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> had similar curative effects to 5-FU plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, however, it was safer in patients with MCRC </plain></SENT>
