<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we use genetic mapping, copy-number analysis, exclusion of mutations by high-throughput sequencing, gene expression analysis and functional assays to show that HMPS is caused by a duplication spanning the 3' end of the SCG5 gene and a region upstream of the GREM1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This unusual mutation is associated with increased allele-specific GREM1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas GREM1 is expressed in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts in controls, GREM1 is predominantly expressed in the epithelium of the large bowel in individuals with HMPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HMPS duplication contains predicted enhancer elements; some of these interact with the GREM1 promoter and can drive gene expression in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased GREM1 expression is predicted to cause reduced bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway activity, a mechanism that also underlies <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0345893" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="JPS|JIP|PJI">juvenile polyposis</z:e> of the large bowel </plain></SENT>
