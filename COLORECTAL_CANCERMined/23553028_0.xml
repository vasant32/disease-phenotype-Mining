<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the results have been conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the association of HFE gene C282Y variant with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PubMed and Embase were retrieved to identify the potential literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of eight papers including nine studies (7,588 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 81,571 controls) for HFE gene C282Y variant were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The result indicated that HFE gene C282Y variant was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> under recessive model (OR = 2.00, 95 % CI = 1.32-3.04), with no evidence of between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (I (2) = 0.2 %, p = 0.432) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further subgroup analysis by number of cases suggested the effect was significant in studies with more than 500 cases (OR = 2.51, 95 % CI = 1.58-3.98, I (2) = 0.0 %, p = 0.921), but not in studies with less than 500 cases (OR = 0.75, 95 % CI = 0.28-1.97, I (2) = 0.0 %, p = 0.622) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The current meta-analysis supported the positive association of HFE gene C282Y variant with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further large-scale studies with the consideration for gene-gene/gene-environment interactions should be conducted to investigate the association </plain></SENT>
