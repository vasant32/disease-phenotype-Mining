<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we employed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips containing 13,900 exonic SNPs to identify genes with allelic gene expression in cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found 2 monoallelically expressed genes (ERAP2 and MYLK4), 32 genes with an allelic imbalance in their expression, and 13 genes showing allele substitution by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> editing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 34 allelically expressed genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, 15 genes (44.1%) were associated with cis-acting eQTL, indicating that large portions of allelically expressed genes are regulated by cis-acting mechanisms of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, potential regulatory variants present in the proximal promoter regions of genes showing either monoallelic expression or allelic imbalance were not tightly linked with coding SNPs, which were detected with allelic gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that multiple rare variants could be involved in the cis-acting regulatory mechanism of allelic gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the comparison with allelic gene expression data from Centre d'Etude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) family B cells, 12 genes showed B-cell specific allelic imbalance and 1 noncoding SNP showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell-specific allelic imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, different patterns of allele substitution were observed between B cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, our study not only indicates that allelic gene expression is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, but our study also provides a better understanding of allele-specific gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
