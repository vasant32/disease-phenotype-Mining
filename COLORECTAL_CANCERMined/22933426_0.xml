<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Randomized trial evidence shows that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) use, particularly long-term use, reduces the incidence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data also suggests an inverse association between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the association between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality among 160,143 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women provided details on medication use at baseline and three years after enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were locally confirmed and centrally adjudicated; cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was determined according to centralized medical record and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression was used to investigate the association between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use at baseline was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality [HR: 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76, 1.14] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, women who reported <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use at both baseline and year 3 experienced reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality (HR: 0.72; 95% CI 0.54, 0.95) compared with nonusers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use is associated with lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality among postmenopausal women who use these medications more consistently over time. impact: Our results support prolonged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use in postmenopausal women for the prevention of poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> outcomes </plain></SENT>
