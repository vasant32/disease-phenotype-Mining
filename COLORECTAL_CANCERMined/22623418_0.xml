<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>5-FU is the most common chemotherapeutic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pooled biological replicates were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS and protein quantification was determined via spectral counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic and proteomic changes were evident and often similar in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SW620 cells were more resistant to 5-FU treatment, with an IC(50) 2.7-fold higher than that for SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, both cell lines showed pronounced abundance changes in pathways relating to antioxidative stress response and cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> remodeling due to 5-FU treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For example, the detoxification enzyme NQO1 was increased with treatment in both cell lines, while disparate members of the peroxiredoxin family, PRDX2 or PRDX5 and PRDX6, were elevated with 5-FU exposure in either SW480 or SW620, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>-associated proteins CTNNB1 and RhoA showed decreased expression with 5-FU treatment in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differential quantitative response in the proteomes of these patient-matched cell lines to drug treatment underscores the subtle molecular differences separating primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
