<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> in heavily pre-treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, who had been exposed to 5-FU, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and irinotecan in the first- and second line setting and mainly with irinotecan and cetuximab as third line treatment, were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
