<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the short-term outcome of patients treated with laparoscopic right colectomy and how intracorporeal anastomosis has improved the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent a laparoscopic right colectomy between January 2006 and December 2010 in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our evaluation criteria were: diagnosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at presurgical biopsy, elective surgery, and the same surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We excluded: emergency surgery, conversions from laparotomic colectomy, and other surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endpoints we examined were: surgical time, number of lymph nodes removed, length of stay (removal of nasogastric tube, bowel movements, gas evacuation, solid and liquid feeding, hospitalization), and major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients were divided into two groups: intracorporeal anastomosis (39 patients) and extracorporeal anastomosis (33 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between intracorporeal vs extracorporeal anastomosis, respectively, for surgical times (186.8 min vs 184.1 min, P &lt; 0.001), time to resumption of gas evacuation (3 d vs 3.5 d, P &lt; 0.001), days until resumption of bowel movements (3.8 d vs 4.9 d, P &lt; 0.001), days until resumption of liquid diet (3.5 d vs 4.5 d, P &lt; 0.001), days until resuming a solid diet (4.6 d vs 5.7 d, P &lt; 0.001), and total hospitalization duration (7.4 d vs 8.5 d, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the intracorporeal group, on average, 19 positive lymph nodes were removed; in the extracorporeal group, on average, 14 were removed P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, intracorporeal anastomosis for right laparoscopic colectomy improved patient outcome by providing faster recovery of nutrition, faster recovery of intestinal function, and shorter hospitalization than extracorporeal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Short-term outcomes favor intracorporeal anastomosis, confirming that a less traumatic surgical approach improves patient outcome </plain></SENT>
