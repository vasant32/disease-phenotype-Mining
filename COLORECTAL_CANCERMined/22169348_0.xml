<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) over a 3-year period were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CT examinations were performed within a single NHS Trust using the same CT system and protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two primary outcomes were assessed: the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> and the identification of a significant, unexpected chest abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred and fourteen out of 568 (90.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients underwent complete CT staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (6%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e>, of which four (0.8%) were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and fifty-three (68.7%) had no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e>, but 130 (25.3%) had indeterminate lung nodules (ILNs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ILNs of 12 patients were subsequently confirmed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A major non-metastatic finding (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> or synchronous primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>) was found in 15/514 patients (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic CT altered the initial TNM stage in fewer than 1% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, but the detection of significant incidental chest disease and the establishment of an imaging baseline are useful outcomes of this imaging strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One-quarter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> staging examinations demonstrated ILNs </plain></SENT>
