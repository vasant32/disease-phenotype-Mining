<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Paneth cells have been reported in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>; however, the frequency of colonic Paneth cell-containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> is unknown as are their clinicopathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 152 consecutive colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> from 103 patients (57 males and 46 females) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of Paneth cells in this cohort of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was determined and correlated with patient demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (17.1%) from 22 (21.4%) patients harbored Paneth cells, which were not limited to the base of the crypts but aberrantly located throughout the crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient age, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> size, villous features, and grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were not different between these 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Not surprisingly, Paneth cell-containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were more likely to occur in the proximal colon (84.6% vs. 55.6%; P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a strong association between male sex and Paneth cell-containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, as 23 of 26 (88.5%) of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> occurred in male individuals compared with 71 of 126 (56.3%) non-Paneth cell-containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upon review of an additional 460 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> from 200 patients with varying numbers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (68 with 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, 68 with 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and 64 with 3 or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>), the risk of harboring synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was associated with villous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, proximal location, and the presence of a Paneth cell-containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of a Paneth cell-containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> may be a marker for increased risk of developing colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
