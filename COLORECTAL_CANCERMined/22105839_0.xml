<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have documented improved outcomes for patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection at NCI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers compared to hospitals without this designation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proposed contributory factors include a higher proportion of surgeons with specialty training in colorectal surgery and surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess whether surgeon specialization is associated with differences in overall survival following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> resection at an NCI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing colectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> from 1994 to 2009 at Duke University Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups based on specialization status of the attending surgeon, and several clinicopathologic variables were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis was then performed examining variables influencing overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total of 395 patients were included in the study, with 335 patients operated on by specialty-trained surgeons and 60 patients operated on by non-specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the two groups were similar with respect to demographic and pathologic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, surgeon specialization was found to be an independent predictor of improved overall survival [HR 0.43 (CI: 0.25-0.75), P = 0.003] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgeon specialization appears to be associated with improved overall survival in the setting of an NCI-designated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center </plain></SENT>
