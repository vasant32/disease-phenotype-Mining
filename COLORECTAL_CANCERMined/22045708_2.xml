<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of antihuman VEGF antibody (bevacizumab) with or without irinotecan was evaluated in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> xenograft using (99m)Tc-(CO)(3) His-annexin A5 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possible synergistic effects of combination therapy with bevacizumab and irinotecan, Colo205-bearing mice were treated with a single dose of bevacizumab 2, 4, or 6 d before administration of a single dose of irinotecan (100 mg/kg) or 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-detecting radiotracer (99m)Tc-(CO)(3) His-annexin A5 was injected (18.5 MBq) in mice 12, 24, and 48 h after the start of the irinotecan or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> treatment, and micro-SPECT was subsequently performed 3.5 h after injection of the radiotracer </plain></SENT>
