<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent computed tomographic colonography (CTC) in the 72-month period from 1 January 2004 to 1 January 2010 were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic data and CTC findings were recorded, according to the CT colonography reporting and data system (CRADS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2152 consecutive CTC patients; comprising 52.6% female, average age of 60 years; range 19-87 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 84% were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRADS: Colonic findings: 99/2152 patients (4.6%) were C2 category (had 1 or 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of 6-9 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>77/2152 (3.6%) patients were C3 category (&gt;9 mm <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> or &gt;2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of 6-9 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>55/2152 (2.5%) were C4 category (possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This comprises a total potential colonoscopy/surgery referral rate of 10.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Extracolonic findings: The majority were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or clinically unimportant findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>178/2152 (8.3%) had potentially significant extracolonic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our CTC population is largely symptomatic, and there is a referral rate from CTC to colonoscopy, surgery or surveillance of 10.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is similar to other NZ data and international studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 8.3% rate of potentially significant extracolonic findings is at the lower end of the reported range </plain></SENT>
