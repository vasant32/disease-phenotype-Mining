<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the association of these 2 variants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> susceptibility using a meta-analysis approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For p53 Arg72Pro, 10 case-control studies including 2587 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> patients and 4061 unrelated controls were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pooled odds ratios (ORs) for Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozygotes were 1.08 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.85-1.37] and 1.08 (95%CI = 0.85-1.36), respectively, when compared to Arg/Arg carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under the dominant effect model, Pro allele carriers also showed no significantly elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> risk (pooled OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 0.90-1.38), and similar results were found under the recessive-effect model (pooled OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 0.85-1.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For variant MDM2 SNP309, 3 case-control studies including 606 cases and 309 controls were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A marginal association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> risk was found for heterozygous G/T carriers (pooled OR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.00- 3.81), whereas homozygous G/G carriers showed an increased but not significantly elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> (pooled OR = 2.14, 95%CI = 0.71-6.45) compared with that of T/T homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found no significant association between the MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> risk (pooled OR = 1.86, 95%CI = 0.94-3.67 and pooled OR = 1.25, 95%CI = 0.62-2.56, respectively) under the dominant and recessive models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the current data suggested that the 2 polymorphisms may not contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
