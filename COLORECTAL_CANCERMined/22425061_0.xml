<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> (TC) and benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> in this patient population is unclear, and guidelines for screening for TC in these patients are not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to report the prevalence of TC and benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> in patients with FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prospectively maintained Hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Family Registry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center was queried to identify patients with FAP and with TC and/or benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six patients with FAP were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 30 men and 36 women, with a median age of 38.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four (6.1%) patients had a history of TC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were women, with a mean age at TC diagnosis of 36.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of the 4 TCs were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238463" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="FNMTC|NMTC">papillary thyroid cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with TC presented with palpable nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An additional 6 (9.1%) patients with FAP had a history of benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo>, including nodules (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> (2), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> (2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goiter</z:hpo> (1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of 4 patients with TC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 patients with benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> had other extracolonic manifestations associated with FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalences of TC (6.1%) and benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> (9.1%) are increased in our patients with FAP and are higher than noted in some previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Periodic thyroid ultrasound screening should be considered in patients with FAP to further elucidate the prevalence and for possible early detection of TC and benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
