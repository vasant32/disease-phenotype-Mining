<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>p63 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 66 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations between p63 expression and clinicopathological factors, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 66 CRC cases, 31 cases (47%) exhibited a high score of p63 expression, while 35 cases (53%) were marked with a low score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The p63 level correlated with peritumoral deposits (p=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year OS rates in the low p63 score and high p63 score groups were, respectively, 49% and 74% (p&amp;lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year PFS rates in the low p63 score and high p63 score groups were, respectively, 44% and 71% (p&amp;lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that p63 expression was correlated with OS and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis suggested that p63 expression was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, p63 was negatively correlated with peritumoral deposits and positively associated with OS and PFS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that p63 is a potential prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
