<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may have the additional advantage that information on extracolonic lesions can be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: : The aim of this study was to investigate the yield of CT-colonography of relevant intra- and extracolonic findings in patients after incomplete colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: : This was an observational, retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: : Data were be obtained from standardized radiology and endoscopy reports and electronic medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: : In total, 136 consecutive CT-colonographies performed after incomplete colonoscopy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: : <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> intra- and extracolonic findings on CT-colonography were recorded and interpreted for clinical relevance, and it was determined whether further diagnostic and/or therapeutic workup was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Major indications for colonoscopy included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (25.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo> (20.6%), change in bowel habits (18.4%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening or surveillance (11.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major reasons for incomplete colonoscopy were a fixed colon (34.6%) and strong angulation of the sigmoid colon (17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Introduction of the colonoscope was limited to the left-sided colon in 53.7% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incomplete colonoscopy detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 12 (8.8%) patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in 27 (19.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CT-colonography after incomplete colonoscopy additionally revealed 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in 15 (11.0%) and a nonsynchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 4 (2.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CT-colonography also detected extracolonic findings with clinical consequences in 8 (5.9%) patients, including fistulizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> (n = 3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric tumor</z:e> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100523'>liver abscess</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> (n = 1), and an infected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in both renal arteries (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: : This study was limited by the lack of confirmation of intraluminal CT-colonography findings in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : Computed tomography-colonography can be of added value in patients with incomplete colonoscopy, because it revealed 27 relevant additional (both intra- and extracolonic) lesions in 19.1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In cases where CT-colonography detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after incomplete colonoscopy, it can also be used for staging purposes </plain></SENT>
