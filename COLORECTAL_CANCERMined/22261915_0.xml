<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the sensitivity and specificity of this test varied among studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of fecal PKM2 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and to evaluate its utility in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was compared to guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) or immunological fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through comprehensive literature search, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity were calculated by using the bivariate random effect model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was also undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall sensitivity and specificity of fecal PKM2 for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 79% (95% CI = 75-83%) and 81% (95% CI = 73-87%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The summary positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 74% (95% CI = 56-87%) and 86% (95% CI = 79-91%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 16 (95% CI = 10-26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In head-to-head comparison, the diagnostic odds ratio of PKM2 and gFOBT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 10.167 (95% CI = 5.992-17.250) and 6.557 (95% CI = 3.467-12.403), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic odds ratio of PKM2 and iFOBT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 9.542 (95% CI = 5.893-15.452) and 67.248 (95% CI = 16.194-279.26), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fecal PKM2 test was a diagnostic tool with moderate sensitivity and specificity for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its diagnostic efficiency was similar to that of gFOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because of its relatively low specificity and positive predict value, fecal PKM2 was not recommended used alone as a screening tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
