<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report findings from a systems study of the intrinsic pathway of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by BCL2 family proteins and clinical translation of its findings into a model with applications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By determining absolute protein quantifications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and patient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, we found that BAK and BAX were expressed more highly than their antiapoptotic inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This counterintuitive finding suggested that sole inhibition of effector BAX and BAK could not be sufficient for systems stability in nonstressed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assuming a model of direct effector activation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only proteins, we calculated that the amount of stress-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only proteins required to activate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> could predict individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> responses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Applying this model predictor to protein profiles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue samples from 26 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, we found that differences in protein quantities were sufficient to model the increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sensitivity to chemotherapy compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, these differences were sufficient to differentiate clinical responders from nonresponders with high confidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Applications of our model, termed DR_MOMP, were used to assess the impact of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-sensitizing drugs in lowering the necessary dose of state-of-the-art chemotherapy in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, our findings offer a ready clinical tool with the potential to tailor chemotherapy to individual patients </plain></SENT>
