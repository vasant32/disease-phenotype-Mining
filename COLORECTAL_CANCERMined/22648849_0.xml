<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2010, transanal specimen extraction technique was performed in 12 patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 8 males and 4 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age ranged from 41 to 67 (mean, 58) years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean operative time was (240±45) min, mean blood loss was (70±40) ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no anastomotic leakage or stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> suffered from intractable right lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and was managed with antispasmodic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of bowel movements was 3-7/d in the 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> and 1-2/d in patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at six months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No local recurrence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after follow-up of 1-20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transanal specimen extraction in laparoscopic colorectal resection is feasible, safe, and reliable </plain></SENT>
