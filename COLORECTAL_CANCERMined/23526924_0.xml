<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, because the sample size and population of previous studies are very different from each other, the conclusions still remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, Databases such as PubMed were applied to search for related papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data were imported into Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V2, which was used to estimate the weighted prevalence of hMLH1 and hMSH2 pathological mutations and compare the differences of prevalence among different family histories, ethnicities and related factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study collected and utilized data from 102 papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Amsterdam-criteria positive group, the prevalence of pathological germline mutations of the hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes was 28.55% (95%CI 26.04%-31.19%) and 19.41% (95%CI 15.88%-23.51%), respectively, and the prevalence of germline mutations in hMLH1/hMSH2 was 15.44%/10.02%, 20.43%/13.26% and 15.43%/11.70% in Asian, American multiethnic and European/Australian populations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Substitution mutations accounted for the largest proportion of germline mutations (hMLH1: 52.34%, hMSH2: 43.25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total prevalence of mutations of hMLH1 and hMSH2 in Amsterdam-criteria positive, Amsterdam-criteria negative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> was around 45%, 25% and 15%, respectively, and there were no obvious differences in the prevalence of germline mutations among different ethnicities </plain></SENT>
