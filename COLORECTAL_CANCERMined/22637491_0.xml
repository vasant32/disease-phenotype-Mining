<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate key patient clinical and demographic characteristics associated with time between colonoscopy and surgery, and choice of treatment centre for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This will add to the little published research examining the pathway following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis and prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of linked data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A population-based sample of people diagnosed August 2004 to December 2007 in New South Wales, Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 569 CRC patients, of whom 407 (72%, 95% CI 68% to 75%) had colonoscopy followed by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Time between colonoscopy and surgery, and whether the surgery took place in a specialist <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 407 eligible patients analysed, the median time from colonoscopy to surgery was 19 days (IQR 12-29 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for key demographic and clinical characteristics such as age and disease stage, the time was longer for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients and those reporting fair/poor health, although differences in medians were &lt;5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>24% (95% CI 20% to 28%) had surgery in a specialist <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centre, which was more common among people resident in metropolitan areas (37% vs 14% for others, adjusted p=0.001) and those without private health insurance (30% vs 21% for others, adjusted p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There do not appear to be systemic issues affecting time from colonoscopy to surgery related to patients' socio-demographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, patients with private insurance and those living in rural areas may be less likely to receive optimal specialist treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A more systematic approach might be needed to ensure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients are treated in specialist <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centres, particularly patients requiring more specialised treatment </plain></SENT>
