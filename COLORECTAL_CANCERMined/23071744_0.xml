<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanism for this synergism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report for the first time that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible transcription factors (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α are involved in these synergistic antitumor effects in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> SW1116 cells in vitro when endostar treatment is combined with the cytotoxic drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under normoxia, we demonstrate that endostar and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> treatments synergize to inhibit SW1116 cell proliferation, Matrigel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and invasion by reduction of CXCR4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistently, these antitumor abilities of endostar and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> were markedly reduced by silencing of CXCR4 in SW1116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under low oxygen conditions (<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, 1% oxygen), enhanced proliferation of SW1116 cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was observed due to the emergence of drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, endostar overcame <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-resistance, most likely as a consequence of reduced HIF-2α and CXCR4 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CXCR4, is only dependent on HIF-2α, which promotes more aggressive phenotype and more significant for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> resistance in SW1116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data not only provide clues to aid understanding of the mechanism of the synergism of endostar and chemotherapy under either normoxia or <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, but also suggests a new strategy of combination endostar and chemotherapy treatments which might potentiate therapeutic efficacies and/or counteract chemotherapy resistance </plain></SENT>
