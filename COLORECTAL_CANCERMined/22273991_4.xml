<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By limiting exposure to these, epidural <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> may enhance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> rates for resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between patients who received perioperative epidurals and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The linked Medicare-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify patients ages 66 yr or older with nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed between 1996 and 2005 who underwent open colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was defined as chemotherapy 16 months or more after surgery and/or radiation 12 months or more after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for at least 4 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To account for hospital effects, overall survival was estimated via marginal Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was estimated by conditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A cohort of 42,151 patients, of whom 22.9% (n = 9,670) had epidurals at the time of resection, was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5-yr survival was 61% in the epidural group and 55% in the nonepidural group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between epidural use and improved survival (adjusted Cox model hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI = [0.87, 0.94]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for covariates, there was no significant reduction of recurrence in the epidural group (odds ratio = 1.05, 95% CI = [0.95, 1.15]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Several covariates, including blood transfusion, were predictive of mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This large cohort study found that epidural use is associated with improved survival in patients with nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergoing resection but does not support an association between epidural use and decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
