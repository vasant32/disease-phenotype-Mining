<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry assay was performed to detect the FOXO4 expression in 80 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and matched noncancerous tissues (18 cases in stage I, 32 in stage II, 24 in stage III and 6 in stage IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between FOXO4 expression and the patients' clinicopathologic features including gender, differentiation and TNM staging was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The positive expression rate of FOXO4 protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues was 47.50%, which was significantly lower than that in matched noncancerous tissues (91.25%, P&lt;O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed that the expression of FOXO4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues were not obviously correlated with the patients' age, gender , <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sizes and depth( P &gt;0.05) . however, there were significant differences of FOXO4 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, TNM stage and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of FOXO4 was significantly decreased or deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, indicating that FOXO4 may function as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor in the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
