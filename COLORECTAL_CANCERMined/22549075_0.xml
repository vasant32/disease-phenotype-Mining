<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: During the last decades, the proximal shift in the distribution of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is uncertain whether the shift is the result of actual changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence or reflects population aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> develop as a result of malignant progression of benign epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>--advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate whether the proximal shift of AA occurs over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two databases were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first one (RETRO) included consecutive patients of the Department of Gastroenterology treated between the years 1981 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondone (Colonoscopy Screening Program--CSP) included asymptomatic participants of the colonoscopy screening program recruited between 2000 and 2004 from the Warsaw region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only patients with AA who underwent total colonoscopy were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AA was defined as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> of 10 mm or more in diameter, with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and villous or tubulovillous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, or any combination of the above features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis was conducted using 2 different definitions of the proximal segment in the large intestine--either splenic flexure or the bend between the descending and sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To compare the distribution of AA, a multiple logistic regression model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 41 of 200 patients (20.5%) in RETRO and 122 of 430 patients (28.4%) in CSP group, respectively, were found to have AA located proximally to the splenic flexure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No proximal shift of AA was found after age and sex adjustment (P&gt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of having proximal AA was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results suggest the lack of proximal shift in the distribution of advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
