<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of gene expression signatures to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis have been proposed, but none is routinely used in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to assess the prediction ability and potential clinical usefulness of these signatures in a series of independent datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature review identified 31 gene expression signatures that used gene expression data to predict prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The search was based on the PubMed database and was restricted to papers published from January 2004 to December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> gene expression datasets with outcome information were identified and downloaded from public repositories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Random Forest classifier was used to build predictors from the gene lists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Matthews correlation coefficient was chosen as a measure of classification accuracy and its associated p-value was used to assess association with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For clinical usefulness evaluation, positive and negative post-tests probabilities were computed in stage II and III samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five gene signatures showed significant association with prognosis and provided reasonable prediction accuracy in their own training datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> signatures showed low reproducibility in independent data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses by stage or microsatellite instability status showed significant association but limited discrimination ability, especially in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From a clinical perspective, the most predictive signatures showed a minor but significant improvement over the classical staging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The published signatures show low prediction accuracy but moderate clinical usefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although gene expression data may inform prognosis, better strategies for signature validation are needed to encourage their widespread use in the clinic </plain></SENT>
