<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To estimate the effects of ginger on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, proliferation, and differentiation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing colonic mucosa, we randomized 20 people at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to 2.0 g of ginger or placebo daily for 28 days in a pilot trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall expression and distributions of Bax, Bcl-2, p21, hTERT, and MIB-1 (Ki-67) in colorectal crypts in rectal mucosa biopsies were measured using automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative to placebo, Bax expression in the ginger group decreased 15.6% (P = 0.78) in the whole crypts, 6.6% (P = 0.95) in the upper 40% (differentiation zone) of crypts, and 21.7% (P = 0.67) in the lower 60% (proliferative zone) of crypts; however, there was a 19% increase (P = 0.14) in Bax expression in the upper 40% relative to the whole crypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While p21 and Bcl-2 expression remained relatively unchanged, hTERT expression in the whole crypts decreased by 41.2% (P = 0.05); the estimated treatment effect on hTERT expression was larger in the upper 40% of crypts (-47.9%; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ginger group, MIB-1 expression decreased in the whole crypts, upper 40% of crypts, and lower 60% of crypts by 16.9% (P = 0.39), 46.8% (P = 0.39), and 15.3% (P = 0.41), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These pilot study results suggest that ginger may reduce proliferation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing colorectal epithelium and increase <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and differentiation relative to proliferation-especially in the differentiation zone of the crypts and support a larger study to further investigate these results </plain></SENT>
