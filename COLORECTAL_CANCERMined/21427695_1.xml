<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown inconsistent results for the association between body size and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inconsistencies may be because of the reliance on self-reported measures of body size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the association of self-reported and directly assessed anthropometric data (body height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist, hip, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and chest circumference) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the EPIC-Norfolk study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 20,608 participants with complete self-reported and measured height and weight and without any history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were followed up an average of 11 years, during which 357 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard Ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, HRs among women in the highest quintile of the body size measure relative to the lowest quintile showed that measured height (HR=1.98, 95% CI=1.19-3.28, P (trend)=0.009), measured waist circumference (HR=1.65, 95% CI=0.97-2.86, P (trend)=0.009) and measured WHR (HR=2.07, 95% CI=1.17-3.67, P (trend)=0.001) were associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations using corresponding self-reported measures were attenuated and not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the association of BMI with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in women was weaker using measured BMI (HR=1.57, 95% CI=0.91-2.73, P (trend)=0.05) compared with self-reported BMI (HR=1.97, 95% CI=1.18-3.30, P (trend)=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In men no significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was observed with any of the anthropometric measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measured height, waist circumference and WHR were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in women, whereas any significant associations with those measures were attenuated when self-reported data were used </plain></SENT>
