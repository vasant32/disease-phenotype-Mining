<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is associated with a risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but the impact of MetS on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> biology and outcomes is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A prospective observational study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients was carried out in an Irish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent metabolic and anthropometric assessment before treatment, including measurement of serum hormones and adipokines and CT measurement of visceral fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MetS was defined according to the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation definition(3)  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MetS was diagnosed in 38% patients compared with the population norms reported at 21%(21)  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MetS was associated with node-positive disease (P = 0.026), percentage nodal involvement (P = 0.033) and extramural vascular invasion (P = 0.049) in male patients but no significant association was observed in female patients </plain></SENT>
