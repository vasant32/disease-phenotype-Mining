<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, molecular role of such a localized <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is not clear in the advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have elaborated the role of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, transcription, and angiogenic factors in the progression of the 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH)-induced late phage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and also observed the chemopreventive role of the two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>), viz., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carcinogenic changes were observed with morphological and histopathological studies, whereas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein regulations of various biomolecules were identified via RT- or qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activity of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes were analyzed using standard NO assay and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) immunoassay, whereas activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and-9) were identified by gelatin zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flowcytometry was performed for the relative quantification of the apoptotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular docking studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> were also performed with different target proteins to observe their putative mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, we found that DMH-treated animals were having over-expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, and IFNγ), aberrant nuclear localization of activated cell survival transcription factors (NF-κB and Stat3) along with the increased incidence of activated angiogenic factors (MMP-2 and MMP-9) suggesting a marked role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> co-administration has significantly reduced the angiogenic potential of the growing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
