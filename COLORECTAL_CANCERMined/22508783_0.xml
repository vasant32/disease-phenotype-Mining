<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 546 patients who underwent curative surgery for primary nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> from May 1, 2004, through December 31, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prognostic value of macroscopic ulceration, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> border configuration, and TILs at the invasive margin was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The low TIL group was significantly correlated with a poorly differentiated status and perineural invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the median 54-month follow-up period, the low TIL group had significantly lower 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates than the high TIL group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> (P = .005 and P = .03, respectively); however, for patients with stage I and II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, the survival rates did not differ between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival and 5-year disease-free survival rates were significantly different between the high and low TIL groups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (P = .003 and P = .01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis confirmed that the TIL grade was significantly and independently associated with a worse prognosis for overall survival but not for disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An inflammatory cell reaction at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasive border is considered a useful predictor of survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery, particularly for patients with stage III disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
