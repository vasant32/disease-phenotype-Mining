<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the effects of fish oil (FO) emulsion containing α-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi> 0.19 g/L on human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HT-29 cell growth, survival, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation were analyzed after a 24-h incubation with FO 18 to 80 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Soybean oil (SO) emulsion was used as an isocaloric and isolipidic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo, <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice bearing HT-29 tumors were sacrificed 7 d after an 11-d treatment with intravenous injections of FO or SO 0.2 g ∙ kg(-1) ∙ d(-1) FO or SO to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FO inhibited cell viability and clonogenicity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SO showed no significant effect compared with untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after treatment with FO 45 mg/L were increased 2.0-fold (P &lt; 0.01) and 1.6-fold (P = 0.04), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, FO treatment did not significantly affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, immunohistochemical analyses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue sections showed a decrease of 0.6-fold (P &lt; 0.01) in the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 and an increase of 2.3-fold (P = 0.03) in the necrotic area, whereas malondialdehyde and total <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> were increased by 1.9-fold (P = 0.09) and 7.0-fold (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of FO-treated compared with untreated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that FO but not SO has an antitumor effect that can be correlated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, despite its vitamin E content </plain></SENT>
