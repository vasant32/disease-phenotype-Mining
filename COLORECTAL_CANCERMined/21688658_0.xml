<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients of group 1 (n=15) received <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi>, lornoxicam and epidural ropivacaine, 2nd group of patients (n=15)-<z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi>, epidural ropivacaine and tramadol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison group (n=10) patients underwent patient controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> by promedol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, 1st and 3rd days after surgery we examined the contents of cytokines in plasma: interleukin 12p70, interleukin 10, interleukin 6, and TNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before surgery and at 5-7 days after surgery indicators of cellular, fagocytal and humoral immunity were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before surgery patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> revealed changes in the indices of different components of immunity, as well as an increase in pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multimodal <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> in patients after operations on the colon is not accompanied by changes in plasma concentrations of cytokines and parameters of immune status in comparison with monoanalgesia by promedol </plain></SENT>
