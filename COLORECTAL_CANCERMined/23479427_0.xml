<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the signaling mechanisms of netrin-DSCAM remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) interacts with DSCAM through its Î³ subunit, but does not interact with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> (deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>), another major receptor for netrin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Netrin-treatment of cultured cortical neurons leads to increased phosphorylation of AMPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both AMPK mutant with dominant-negative effect and AMPK inhibitor can significantly suppress netrin-1 induced neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings demonstrate that AMPK interacts with DSCAM and plays an important role in netrin-1 induced neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study uncovers a previously unknown component, AMPK, in netrin-DSCAM signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
