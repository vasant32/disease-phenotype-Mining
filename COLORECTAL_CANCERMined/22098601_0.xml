<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this paper is to analyse long-term survival as well as staging and treatment patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Estonia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed in Estonia in 1997 (n = 546), identified through the Estonian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and followed up for 10 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Staging and treatment data were retrospectively collected from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative survival rate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi>) was used to estimate the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The 5-year <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi> was 51% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 38% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>; the corresponding 10-year <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi> was 50% and 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed no excess mortality for early disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For stages II and III, the survival was markedly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (5-year <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi> 79% and 66%, respectively) compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (66% and 30%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Around 30% of cases were diagnosed with distant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among radically operated colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients, the 10-year <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi> was 90% and 70%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most patients with available pathological information had one to four lymph nodes examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival has notably improved for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, but not for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in Estonia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High proportion of cases with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> at first diagnosis along with inadequate staging and low proportion of patients treated with curatively intended surgery and appropriate chemotherapy and radiotherapy may have contributed to this outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Progress could be achieved by earlier diagnosis and implementing higher standards for staging and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These conclusions are likely to be relevant also for other Eastern European countries </plain></SENT>
