<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protein has been used as a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells, although the function and mechanism of CD133 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, we examined the role of CD133 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> invasion in vitro and investigated the mechanism involved in CD133-related invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD133(high) and CD133(low) HCT116 cells were isolated, and the proliferation and invasive ability of these two subpopulations were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD133(high) HCT116 cells exhibited greater proliferation and invasion compared with CD133(low) HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD133 knockdown (using CD133 small-interfering [si]<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) inhibited the invasive activity of CD133si-HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the first time, we found that the expression of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) was down-regulated in CD133si-HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, for the TIMP-2si-HCT116 cells (transfected with TIMP-2 siRNA), in vitro invasion was significantly decreased, whereas the expression of CD133 remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the metalloproteinase 2 and MEK/ERK signaling pathways were examined, and no significant change was observed after the knockdown of CD133 or TIMP-2 in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrated that CD133 plays an important role in HCT116 cell invasion, and for the first time, we found that CD133 knockdown significantly down-regulated TIMP-2 expression, which suggests that CD133 affects the invasive ability of HCT116 cells by regulating TIMP-2 </plain></SENT>
