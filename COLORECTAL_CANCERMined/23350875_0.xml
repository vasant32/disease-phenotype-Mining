<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is a disease of complex aetiology, with much of the expected inherited risk being due to several common low risk variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified 20 CRC risk variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these have only been able to explain part of the missing heritability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these signals have only been inspected in populations of Northern European origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thus, we followed the same approach in a Spanish cohort of 881 cases and 667 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four variants at 24 loci were found to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at p-values &lt;10-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the 24 loci in another Spanish replication cohort (1481 cases and 1850 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of these SNPs, rs12080929 at 1p33 (Preplication=0.042; Ppooled=5.523x10-03; OR (CI95%)=0.866(0.782-0.959)) and rs11987193 at 8p12 (Preplication=0.039; Ppooled=6.985x10-5; OR (CI95%)=0.786(0.705-0.878)) were replicated in the second Phase, although they did not reach genome-wide statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have performed the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> GWAS in a Southern European population and by these means we were able to identify two new susceptibility variants at 1p33 and 8p12 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These two SNPs are located near the SLC5A9 and DUSP4 loci, respectively, which could be good functional candidates for the association signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We therefore believe that these two markers constitute good candidates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility loci and should be further evaluated in other larger datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we highlight that were these two SNPs true susceptibility variants, they would constitute a decrease in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> missing heritability fraction </plain></SENT>
