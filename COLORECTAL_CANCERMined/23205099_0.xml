<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that PZH is capable of inhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> growth both in vivo and in vitro via the promotion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of the tumoricidal activity of PZH, its effect on the proliferation of human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> Caco-2 cells was evaluated and the underlying molecular mechanism was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that PZH inhibited Caco-2 cell viability and survival in a dose- and/or time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, PZH treatment was found to block the G1/S cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PZH suppressed the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of pro-proliferative Cyclin D1 and CDK4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings of the present study suggest that inhibition of cell proliferation via the G1/S cell cycle arrest is a potential mechanism by which PZH can be effective in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
