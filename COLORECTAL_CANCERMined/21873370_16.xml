<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intraoperative fluid therapy regimens using oesophageal Doppler monitoring (ODM) to optimize <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume (SV) (goal-directed fluid therapy, GDT) have been associated with a reduction in length of stay (LOS) and complication rates after major surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that intraoperative GDT would reduce the time to surgical readiness for discharge (RfD) of patients having major elective colorectal surgery but that this effect might be less marked in aerobically fit patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this double-blinded controlled trial, 179 patients undergoing major open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery were characterized as aerobically 'fit' (n=123) or 'unfit' (n=56) on the basis of their performance during a cardiopulmonary exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within these fitness strata, patients were randomized to receive a standard fluid regimen with or without ODM-guided intraoperative GDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GDT patients received an average of 1360 ml of additional intraoperative colloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean cardiac index and SV at skin closure were significantly higher in the GDT group than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Times to RfD and LOS were longer in GDT than control patients but did not reach statistical significance (median 6.8 vs 4.9 days, P=0.09, and median 8.8 vs 6.7 days, P=0.09, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fit GDT patients had an increased RfD (median 7.0 vs 4.7 days; P=0.01) and LOS (median 8.8 vs 6.0 days; P=0.01) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative SV optimization conferred no additional benefit over standard fluid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In an aerobically fit subgroup of patients, GDT was associated with detrimental effects on the primary outcome </plain></SENT>
