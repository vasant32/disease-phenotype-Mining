<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in Western countries have found a robust association between higher social support and improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes, particularly for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> incidence and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, less is known about the influence of social support on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> among Asian populations where the measures of social support may differ in social relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this prospective cohort study in Japan, we sought to examine the associations between the incidence and mortality of total and site-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined prospectively the association between social support and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality within a cohort of 44,152 Japanese men and women, aged 40-69 years, free of prior diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Social support was measured by emotional support defined as receipt of confidant support and esteem support from family members or friends and by social isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,444 cases of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and 1,561 cancer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred between the baseline questionnaire (1993-1994) and the end of follow-up in January 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The multivariate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality in the highest social support versus lowest social support group were 1.48 (1.06-2.05) and 3.07 (1.65-5.69) in men, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Social support was not associated with other site-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low social support was associated with higher risk of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Social support may affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and prognosis via a range of factors, including healthier lifestyles as well as adherence to therapeutic regimens </plain></SENT>
