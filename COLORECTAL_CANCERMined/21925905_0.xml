<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop a novel prognostic model that captures complex interplay among clinical and histologic factors to predict survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after a radical potentially curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Survival data of 2,505 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 2,430 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients undergoing radical colorectal resection between 1969 and 2007 were analyzed by random forest technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of TNM and non-TNM factors such as histologic grade, lymph node ratio (number positive/number resected), type of operation, neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment, American Society of Anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) class, and age in staging and prognosis were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A forest of 1,000 random survival trees was grown using log-rank splitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Competing risk-adjusted random survival forest methods were used to maximize survival prediction and produce importance measures of the predictor variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Competing risk-adjusted 5-year survival after resection of colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> was dominated by pT stage (ie, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltration depth) and lymph node ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased lymph node ratio was associated with worse survival within the same pT stage for both colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was affected by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade, the type of resection and neoadjuvant therapy had a strong effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern in predicted survival rates was observed for patients with fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our model suggests that lymph node ratio remains a significant predictor of survival in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A novel data-driven methodology predicts the survival times of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and identifies patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The methods lead to stage groupings that could redefine the composition of TNM in a simple and orderly way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The higher predictive power of lymph node ratio as compared with traditional pN lymph node stage has specific implications and may address the important question of accuracy of staging in patients when fewer than 12 nodes are identified in the resection specimen </plain></SENT>
