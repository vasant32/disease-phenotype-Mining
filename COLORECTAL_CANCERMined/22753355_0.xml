<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some patients considered for HAI have evidence of minimal extrahepatic disease (EHD), and the role of HAI in these situations is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with unresectable CRLM treated with HAI and systemic chemotherapy from 2000 to 2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival of patients who were ultimately proven to have low-volume EHD was compared to those without EHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-three patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine percent of patients were previously treated with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-five patients (39%) ultimately proved to have EHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival from HAI pump placement in patients without EHD was 32 months compared to 16 months for patients with EHD, P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival from HAI pump placement in patients with a single site of EHD was 18 months compared to 9 months for those with multiple sites of EHD, P = 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study of heavily pre-treated patients, overall survival was favorable in patients who proved to have EHD at one site </plain></SENT>
