<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the use and clinical outcomes of the Vertical Rectus Abdominus Myocutaenous (VRAM) flap as a reconstruction technique in a heterogenic cohort of patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in whom neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy had been performed pre-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of patients having VRAM flaps for pelvic reconstruction in a tertiary referral centre from 2001 to 2010 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>37 patients (23 female, 14 male) underwent pelvic extenuative surgery of which 22 (60%) had recurrent pelvic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surgical and medical complications were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major flap complications were defined as 'requiring return to the operating theatre at any stage' and these occurred in 6 (16%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 7 (19%) minor flap complications defined as 'requiring conservative non surgical treatment' The total global re-intervention rate of patients requiring return to theatre for re-operation as a result of their exenteration and reconstruction was 6 (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We highlight the merits and versatility of the VRAM flap in advanced pelvic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in obtaining stable and supple reconstructive cover and the relative low morbidity in this difficult group confirms out strong support for immediate VRAM reconstruction in pelvic exenterative procedures </plain></SENT>
