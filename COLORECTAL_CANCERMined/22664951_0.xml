<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has so far been little information on the clinical effect of bevacizumab against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, this study was conducted to retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 181 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) received bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy at 18 hospitals in Kumamoto prefecture, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We surveyed the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients regarding the patient characteristics, objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed their overall survival and the survival benefit when continuing the administration of bevacizumab beyond disease progression (progressive disease; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) in patients who received bevacizumab-containing 1st line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate (RR) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines of therapy was 42 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 1st line patients showed significantly better survival in comparison to the patients who received further lines of treatment (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in survival between the group with post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> treatment with bevacizumab and the group with post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> treatment without bevacizumab (P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 or greater adverse event associated with bevacizumab was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (12.2 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Especially, a high incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was shown in this study (4.4 %) and most of the patients with GI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> had some risk factors for this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the survival benefit of bevacizumab in Japanese patients with mCRC was similar to that observed in previous clinical trials, this study showed a high incidence of GI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in comparison to previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the careful selection of patients with few risk factors for this complication is likely to lead to a greater benefit from bevacizumab treatment </plain></SENT>
