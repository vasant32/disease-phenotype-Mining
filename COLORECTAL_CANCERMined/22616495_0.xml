<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the adherence in general population is about 50% and even lower among physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: 1) To estimate the percentage of physicians that had done a screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2) To estimate the frequency of tests used by these professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted an anonymous survey among 269 physicians, 50-year-old or more, from four hospitals and four scientific conventions in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This validated survey included specialty, family history, compliance to screening, clinical features at screening, age, tests used reasons for having or not done the tests and results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four hundred and two data surveys were included (response rate 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average age was 58+6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specialties were Internal Medicine (72%), Surgery (18%) and others (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred physicians had a test done [41% (IC95% 35-47)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most used test was colonoscopy [70% (IC 95% 60-78)], followed by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema [10% (IC 95% 5-18)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From screened physicians, 36% had family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 63% did not and 1% was unaware of this antecedent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Physicians referred the following reasons for not being compliant: personal decision, fear of the procedure, insufficient knowledge of guidelines and lack of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The compliance of physicians to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>New strategies should be implemented to achieve changes in health habits of physicians and compliance to preventive strategies </plain></SENT>
