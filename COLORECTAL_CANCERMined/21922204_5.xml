<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although there is convincing evidence that physical activity reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk, there are important questions that remain unanswered about the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include the timing and intensity of activity required to optimally reduce risk, and whether physical activity has a different effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> at different sites within the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study to investigate these issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was conducted in Western Australia in 2005-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on various risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated effects of recreational physical activity on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the distal colon, proximal colon, and rectum were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis included 870 cases and 996 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was reduced by performing a high level of vigorous-intensity activity between the ages 19 and 34 years (women), 35 and 50 years (men), after the age of 51 years (men and women), and consistently over the adult lifetime (men and women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> was reduced by performing a high level of vigorous activity between the ages 35 and 50 years (men), and consistently over the adult lifetime (men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk was not associated with physical activity in any of the age periods or over the adult lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moderate intensity activity did not reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Physical activity may have a greater effect on the risk of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> than proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vigorous physical activity is required to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
