<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though mutations in the KRAS gene have been confirmed as negative predictors of the response to EGFR-targeted therapies, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt-KRAS) patients will respond to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, 239 samples obtained from 215 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were tested for the presence of the seven most common mutations in the KRAS gene and the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the tested patients, 53.8% of patients had wt-KRAS genotype and 46.2% were KRAS mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Around five percent (5.1%) of the tested patients bore the V600E mutation in BRAF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients showing to have the V600E mutation in BRAF were wt-KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concordance of KRAS and BRAF mutational status between primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e> tissue samples was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the proportions of mutated and non-mutated KRAS in Slovene patients, as well as the proportion of V600E mutations in BRAF is similar to genotyping results reported by other authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The tested seven KRAS mutations on codons 12 and 13 were mutually exclusive with the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Summing up the results about the KRAS and the BRAF mutation carriers from our study, the portion of potentially non-responsive patients for the anti-EGFR treatment is 51.3% </plain></SENT>
