<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Within the framework of a prospective, multicenter observational study (Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery Study Group), into which a total of 5,863 patients from 69 hospitals were recruited over a period of 10 years, a subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had undergone curative resection was analyzed with regard to the effects of conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1409 patients who had undergone curative resection for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, conversion had to be performed in 80 (5.7%) cases for the most diverse reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration of surgery (median: 183 vs. 241 minutes; P&lt;.001) was significantly longer in the conversion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perioperatively, significant disadvantages were noted in converted patients in terms of intraoperative blood loss (median: 243 vs. 573â€‰mL, P&lt;.001), need for perioperative blood transfusion (10.8% vs. 33.8%; P&lt;.001), and resumption of bowel movement (median: after 3 vs. 4 days; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With regard to postoperative morbidity, significant disadvantages were observed in converted patients, in particular in terms of specific surgical complications, including a higher rate of anastomotic insufficiency (5.0% vs. 13.8%; P=.003) and a higher reoperation rate (4.9% vs. 15.0%; P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the long term, conversion was associated with lower overall survival, but not with poorer disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significantly higher postoperative morbidity was observed in patients after conversion, in particular in terms of specific surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, conversion is associated with overall lower survival but not with poorer disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
