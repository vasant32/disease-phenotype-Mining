<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate what proportion of IFOBT-positive subjects with negative colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy has pathologies of the small intestine detected by capsule endoscopy (CE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 2008 and June 2010, asymptomatic IFOBT-positive patients with negative total colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy underwent CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CE findings were classified into three categories: P0 (no abnormalities, or findings without potential for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>), P1 (findings with uncertain potential for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>), P2 and (findings with high potential for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (37 males, 16 females; 52.1 Â± 13.0 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no cases with P2, 19 cases with P1, and 34 cases with P0 (there were no abnormalities in 25 of 34 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, lesions in the small intestine were detected in 28 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional examination was considered necessary for five patients after CE, but no abnormality was detected, and therapeutic intervention was not undertaken in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caecal completion rate was 92.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No significant pathologies of the small intestine were detected in asymptomatic IFOBT-positive cases with negative colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CE is of limited use in asymptomatic patients with positive IFOBT </plain></SENT>
