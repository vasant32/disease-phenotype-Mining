<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mAbs, blocking ligand/receptor interactions, exert their biological activity via multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of cell cycle progression, potentiation of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and, potentially, induction of immunological effector mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR mAb currently used in mCRC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the evidence of efficacy of cetuximab in the treatment of mCRC patients, the observation of low response rates was the proof of concept of resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of molecular alterations have been more recently hypothesized to be involved in resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: mutations in BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA, loss of expression of PTEN and, now, activation of HER2 signaling through HER2 gene amplification and/or increased heregulin stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: This review focuses on the development of new strategies such as combination with other agents blocking alternative escape pathways, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell prioritization hyperactivating EGFR pathway, combination with immune system, development of nanotech devices to increase efficacy of antibody-based therapy and overcome the mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell resistance </plain></SENT>
