<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative chemotherapy may make initially irresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> resectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare perioperative course and short-term mortality after liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> between patients who were and were not treated with preoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who had undergone liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 97 patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy (group A) were compared with 136 who were not (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, operating time, complications, duration of stay, and mortality were compared using Pearson's Ï‡(2) test, Fisher's exact test, and the Mann-Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, duration of stay, and operating time were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 62.9% and 63.2% in groups A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30- and 90-day mortality rates were zero in group A, comparable to 1.5% in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the perioperative course or postoperative mortality when comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with or without chemotherapy prior to liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, this study suggests that preoperative chemotherapy before liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> does not negatively influence perioperative outcome and can therefore be applied if "downstaging" is indicated </plain></SENT>
