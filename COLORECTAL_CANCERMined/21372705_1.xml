<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and survivors experience impairments in their ability to work as a result of diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the literature demonstrates favorable return-to-work rates, there is a lack of intervention studies that have sought to enhance reemployment and return-to-work outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of an intervention designed to offer brief tailored information on work ability during treatment to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen employed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were recruited to test the feasibility of the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were provided with an educational leaflet and a face-to-face return-to-work consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This included advice and guidance on managing symptoms at work, communication with employer, and information on work ability during and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was tailored according to work type (manual/nonmanual) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most participants found key aspects of the intervention useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, information and advice on the impact of treatment upon work ability were considered most valuable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although levels of work ability and well-being did not change during the intervention, there were trends of improvement in the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the content of this intervention could aid return to work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Most participants felt that specialist <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> nurses and consultants were best placed to deliver return-to-work interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> nurses provide patients with a significant amount of information at diagnosis and treatment, our findings suggest that raising employment matters early on could help identify the most suitable time to deliver a return-to-work intervention </plain></SENT>
