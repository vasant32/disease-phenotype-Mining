<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has become established as a minimally invasive surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many disposable instruments are required, and there is an associated disadvantage of cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new technique, which uses a suture string to lift up the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method is expected to reduce the number of access ports required without compromising the radical cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: A suture string piercing the abdominal wall is passed through the mesocolon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The colon is retracted anteriorly and is fixed at the abdominal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main mesenteric vessels are under tension, and lymph node dissection is performed easily by a medial approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The working space is more stable because the colon is fixed to the abdominal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study examined the short-term and long-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using our colon lifting-up technique (CLT), compared with the standard multiport technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study design was a case-matched control by propensity scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analyzed variables were sex, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in a different organ, multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, operator, operative year, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, operative procedure, adjuvant chemotherapy, and International Union Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> TNM stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2000 to 2010, 301 patients underwent CLT and 436 standard multiport technique, 148 patients were matched by propensity score and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Regarding short-term outcomes, there was no difference between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean number of ports needed was 3.37Â±0.48 for CLT (93 with 3 ports, 55 with 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in recurrence-free survival and overall survival in long-term follow-up results for each stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were neither recurrences nor complications due to CLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CLT facilitated laparoscopic colectomy without compromising cure rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is a useful method to keep a stable view and to conserve medical resources </plain></SENT>
