<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ovarian Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial (PLCO), we assessed the long-term disease-specific functioning among <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> (PCa) survivors versus noncancer controls, the impact of trial arm (screening/usual care) on functioning, and the effect of treatment modality on functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: PCa survivors (n = 529), 5 to 10 years postdiagnosis, were frequency-matched to noncancer controls (n = 514) for race, screening center, year of enrollment, and trial arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants completed a telephone interview regarding PCa-specific symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weights accounted for patient selection from the five PLCO screening centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Propensity-score methods were used to balance groups of interest with respect to demographic and medical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Weighted linear regression analyses revealed poorer sexual and urinary function among PCa survivors compared with noncancer controls (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trial arm was not significantly related to any outcome (P &gt; .31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with radical prostatectomy patients (n = 201), radiation-therapy patients (n = 110) reported better sexual (P &lt; .05) and urinary (P &lt; .001) functioning but poorer bowel outcomes (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survivors who received treatment combinations including <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> deprivation (n = 207) reported significantly poorer hormone-related symptoms compared with radical prostatectomy patients (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION This study demonstrated the persistence of clinically significant, long-term PCa treatment-related sexual and urinary adverse effects up to 10 years postdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this was the first comparison of prostate-related dysfunction among screened survivors versus screened noncancer controls and indicated that these long-term problems were attributable to PCa treatment and not to aging or comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, differences in long-term adverse effects between treatment modalities are particularly relevant for patients and clinicians when making treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
