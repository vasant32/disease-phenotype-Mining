<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are often used to treat solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, but drug resistance and toxicity are drawbacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is an unmet need for a functional assay to quantify fluorouracil activity in tissues, so as to individually tailor dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is cumbersome to separately quantify unmodified and 5FU-modified TS using currently available commercial anti-TS antibodies because they recognize both forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here the first monoclonal antibody (FTS) specific to 5FU-modified TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By immunoblot assay, the FTS antibody specifically recognizes modified TS in a dose-dependent manner in 5FU-treated cells, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> xenograft tissues of 5FU-treated mice, and in the murine tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the same assay, the antibody is nonreactive with unmodified TS in untreated or treated cells and tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Speculatively, a high-throughput assay could be enabled by pairing anti-TS antibodies of two specificities, one recognizing only modified TS and another recognizing both forms, to structurally quantify the TS-inhibiting effect of fluorouracil at a cellular or tissue level without requiring prior protein separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such a development might aid preclinical analytic studies or make practical the individual tailoring of dosing </plain></SENT>
