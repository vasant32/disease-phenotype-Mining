<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite several years of research and attempts to develop prognostic models a considerable fraction of stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients will experience relapse within few years from their operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic importance of miRNA-21 (miR-21), quantified by in situ hybridisation, in a unique, large population-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 764 patients diagnosed with stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in Denmark in the year 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One section from a representative paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue specimen from each patient was processed for analysis of miR-21 and quantitatively assessed by image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The miR-21 signal was predominantly observed in fibroblast-like cells located in the stromal compartment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that patients expressing high levels of miR-21 had significantly inferior recurrence-free <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (RF-CSS): HR=1.26; 95% CI: 1.15-1.60; P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analysis, a high level of miR-21 retained its prognostic importance and was found to be significantly related to poor RF-CSS: HR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.19-1.67; P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study showed that increasing miR-21 expression levels were significantly correlated to decreasing RF-CSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigations of the clinical importance of miR-21 in the selection of high-risk stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients are merited </plain></SENT>
