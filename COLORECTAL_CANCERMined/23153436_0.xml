<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether Lgr5 is a potential marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells, we investigated whether Lgr5 expression correlated with Ki-67 expression and prognosis in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lgr5 and Ki-67 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 192 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selection of side population (SP) cells was performed by staining with Hoechest 33342, and Lgr5 expression in Colo205 SP cells was then detected by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lgr5 expression was significantly higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lgr5 was positively correlated with histological grade (P=0.001), depth of invasion (P=0.001), lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P=0.001), distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P=0.004), pTNM stage (P=0.001), and Ki-67 (r=0.446, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the effect of Lgr5 on survival was independent of Ki-67 (P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro study, Hoechst low-staining cells were counted in 7% of the Colo205 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line population, and Lgr5 expression was strikingly stronger in Hoechst low-staining cells than in high-staining cells (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Lgr5 may play an important role in the progression and prognosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and may be a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may also be considered as a potential marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> stem cells (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
