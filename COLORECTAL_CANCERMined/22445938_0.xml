<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cleansing quality and tolerability according to the timing of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> administration in persons undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participants in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening were randomized to two groups: a) control group (colonoscopy scheduled at 9-12 h); preparation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> on the previous afternoon; b) study group (colonoscopy scheduled at 12-15 h): preparation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> on the morning of the colonoscopy, with the option of a split dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The quality of cleansing was evaluated with the Boston scale and tolerability through a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 282 participants were included: preparation was carried out the day before the procedure in 134 and on the same day in 148, of which 26 received a split dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cleansing was adequate in 95% (n=268) of the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The quality of cleansing was higher in the study group (P=.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interval between the end of administration and the beginning of the procedure was inversely correlated with the Boston scale score (P=.036; r=-0.125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tolerability was unrelated to the time of administration (P&gt;.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acceptance of the timing of administration was lower in the study group than in the control group (26% vs 10%, respectively; P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preparation as close as possible to the colonoscopy improves the quality of cleansing with no detrimental effects on tolerability, although this option is less comfortable </plain></SENT>
