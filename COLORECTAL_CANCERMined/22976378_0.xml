<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The oncogenic single nucleotide polymorphism rs6983267, located on 8q24.21, may affect copy number aberrations and/or expression profiles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of this single nucleotide polymorphism in the clinical outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and oligomicroarrays were performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells from 157 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression profiles were analyzed by means of extraction expression module (EEM) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in TP53, KRAS, and BRAF and microsatellite instability were also examined in 107 of the 157 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: aCGH analysis revealed two clusters; more frequent genomic copy number alteration (CNA) was observed in the 89 cases in cluster B than in the 18 cases in cluster A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average CNA was higher in samples containing the major allele (GT/TT) of rs6983267 than in those containing the minor allele (GG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, MYC expression was the highest in samples containing the GG allele (n = 18), followed by the GT and TT alleles (n = 41 and 48, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EEM analysis revealed dominant up-regulation of MYC in samples containing the minor allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the presence of the minor allele in a MYC-positive, CNA-negative context predicted a poorer prognosis than the presence of the major allele in a MYC-negative, CNA-positive context in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the minor allele of rs6983267 at 8q24.21 worsened the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> through up-regulation of MYC transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may require global CNA in the presence of the major allele and with lack of MYC transcription </plain></SENT>
