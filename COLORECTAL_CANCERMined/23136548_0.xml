<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A great number of in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that many pathways or factors can stimulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and lymphangiogenesis, which facilitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the morphological and immunohistochemical profile of newly formed vasculatures has not been elucidated, making it difficult to differentiate them from the pre-existing ones, and to identify their unique molecular profiles for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS: As cytokeratin (CK)-19 is a well-recognized stem cell marker and CK-19-positive cells are frequently detected in the peripheral blood of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e>, our recent studies have assessed the involvement of CK-19 in the formation of new vasculatures in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our studies showed that a subset of lymph node-positive cases harbored some isolated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelial structures with distinct CK-19 immunostaining within an otherwise CK-19-negative background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These structures are exclusively located within or adjacent to lymphoid follicles and are often surrounded by tube-like structures expressing lymphatic endothelial marker D2-40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar structures are more frequently seen at the junctions between pre-invasive and invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with the following features: (1). they consist of a single layer of endothelial cells that express both D2-40 and CD34, (2). their endothelial walls are often incomplete with disseminated cells protruding into the adjacent stroma, and (3). they are exclusively associated with disseminated CK-19-positive cells HYPOTHESIS: Based on these findings, we propose that these tube-like structures represent newly formed vasculatures, which are derived by the convergence of aberrant lymphocyte infiltration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of their close physical proximity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stem cells within the epithelial and stromal components contribute equally and coordinately to the morphogenesis of new vasculatures, which constitutes the basis for the unique morphologic and immunohistochemical features of newly formed vasculatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis appears to be applicable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> epithelium-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
