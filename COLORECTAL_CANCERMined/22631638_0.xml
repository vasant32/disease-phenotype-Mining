<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no robust data on prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to establish a prognostic model for patients using an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based or irinotecan-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline characteristics and outcomes on 170 patients treated with FOLFIRI or XELOX plus anti-VEGF therapy-naive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were collected from three Turkey <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors for OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median OS for the whole cohort was 19 months (95% CI, 14.3 to 23.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the seven adverse prognostic factors according to the Anatolian Society of Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> (ASMO) were independent predictors of short survival: serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) greater than the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (ULN; p&lt;0.001); neutrophils greater than the ULN (p&lt;0.0014); and progression free survival (PFS) less than 6 months (p =0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum LDH and neutrophil levels were the main prognostic factors in predicting survival, followed by PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model validates incorporation of components of the ASMO model into patient care and clinical trials that use VEGF-targeting agents </plain></SENT>
