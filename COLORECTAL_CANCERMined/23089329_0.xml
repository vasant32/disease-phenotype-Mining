<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each course comported 5 FU 3g/m(2), folinic acid (600mg/m(2) - l. form or 1200mg/m(2) - racemic form) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (85/mg/m(2) - adjuvant indication or 100mg/m(2) - palliative indication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to chronobiological concepts, 5 FU and folinic acid were infused from 10 pm to 10 am with a peak at 4 am while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was delivered from 10 am to 10 pm with a peak at 4 pm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall tolerance was excellent with a maximum of 17% patients experiencing a grade 3 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The toxicity was higher in women, in older patients (&gt;=70) or in case of flat infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In adjuvant situation (60 cases), progression free and overall survivals established respectively at 76% (42+months) and 88% (45+months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two percent response rate were recorded within the palliative group (50 cases) with an overall 68% disease control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median progression free survival was seven months but median survival was not attained at 31+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent patients could benefit from a curative surgery after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Older patients (&gt;=70) experienced worsened survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we think that our chrono-FOLFOX 2-12 should be proposed as standard treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
