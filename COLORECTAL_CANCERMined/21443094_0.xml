<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by a relatively earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> compared to that in the western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studying genetic alterations involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression may help in identifying molecular biomarkers that can be used for early detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: We analyzed DNA isolated from 83 cases including 38 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 23 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (16 of which were adenomatous) and 22 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations at KLF6 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene (exon 1-4) were examined by PCR-SSCP silver staining technique followed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>10p15 LOH was analyzed using KLF6 M1, KLF6 M2 and KLF6 M4 markers by microsatellite assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KLF6 mutations were found in 45%, 27% and 26% of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the mutations detected were located at exon 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of mutations found in KLF6 were missense mutation and their type and locations were different from those previously described in the western population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of LOH at the three markers examined were 29%, 36%, and 52% for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, IBD, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LOH was detected in mutant KLF6 as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between genetic alterations examined with different clinicopathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlights for the first time an association of KLF6 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in an Egyptian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Detecting mutational sites different from those in western population is a characteristic feature in our study which may be related to environmental and/or genetic factors that have to be further identified </plain></SENT>
