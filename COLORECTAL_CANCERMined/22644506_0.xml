<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite a large number of clinical trials having been conducted to assess the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, whether it is best to use this treatment remains a generally contentious issue for many common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether any general conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy or inefficacy of this treatment within different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery were synthesized over as many types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data sources were Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eligible meta-analyses were meta-analyses of RCTs for any type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> that compared surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with surgery followed by no adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The literature search found 25 meta-analyses for 15 cancer types that satisfied the criteria necessary for detailed analysis within this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimates of relative risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality were reported as being less than one (indicating adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial) by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> meta-analyses apart from a meta-analysis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> metastasized to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 15 of these meta-analyses also reported that the 95% confidence interval for this relative risk is less than one (indicating statistical significance at the 5% level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types included in this study except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> metastasized to the liver can be thought of as supporting each other through the idea of there being a common treatment effect or at least a common range of effect across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (or most) of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For example, with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types where the evidence in favor of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery is only moderately strong, the results of this study may encourage more clinicians to regard the use of this treatment as standard practice </plain></SENT>
