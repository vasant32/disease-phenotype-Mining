<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Real time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) assays were used to enumerate DSV in gastrointestinal tract of 58 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diversity of gut microbiota was analyzed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA V3 sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RT-PCR detected DSV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased numbers of DSV were observed for UC and PP groups compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and H groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and H groups with gene copy numbers of DSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alterations of DSV and gut microbiota were observed in disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that quantity and diversity of DSV are significantly increased in UC and PP compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased numbers of DSV in disease groups suggests a possible harmful role </plain></SENT>
