<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is little understanding about how inflammatory cytokines mediate bystander effects, but questions in this area are important because of the pivotal contributions made by inflammatory processes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> initiation and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that the central proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α acts as a diffusible mediator of the bystander effects induced by macrophages, an effect caused by a proliferation of macrophages that trigger epithelial cell production of Netrin-1, a neuronal guidance molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNF-α-mediated bystander assays used a murine coculture system of primary colonic epithelial cells and E. faecalis-infected macrophages (in vitro), with an interleukin 10 (IL-10)-deficient mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> that involves long-term colonization with E. faecalis (in vivo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cell cocultures, we observed increased expression of the TNF-α receptor Tnfrsf1b and Netrin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were blocked by anti-TNF-α antibody or by pretreatment with an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RNAi-mediated attenuation of Tnfrsf1b decreased TNF-α-induced netrin-1 production and augmented epithelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extending these observations, colon biopsies from E. faecalis-colonized IL-10(-/-) mice exhibited crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and increased staining for macrophages, TNF-α, netrin-1, NF-κB, Tnfrsf1b, and the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen while also displaying a reduction in epithelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, our results define a pathway for macrophage-induced bystander effects in which TNF-α triggers TNFRSF1b receptor signaling leading to increased production of Netrin-1, crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, and decreased epithelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In elucidating an important commensal-associated proinflammatory mechanism in the intestinal microenvironment, our work highlights the role of Netrin-1 and a specific TNF-α receptor as candidate targets to prevent or treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
