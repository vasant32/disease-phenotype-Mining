<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among urban publicly insured women and to evaluate how barriers among underscreened urban women have changed between 2001 and 2007-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible women were selected using Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MMCO) administrative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MMCO outreach staff interviewed women by phone between October 2007 and February 2008, and assessed their barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the results of these interviews with interviews conducted in 2001 with women in community health center waiting rooms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty percent of overdue women had never heard of either colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and 55% had never heard of home fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among overdue women who had heard of colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, 33% reported misconceptions and 28% reported worry as a barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No clinician recommendation was the most commonly reported barrier to home FOBT (44%) and was also reported as a barrier to endoscopy by 22% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between 2001 and 2007-2008, the proportion of women reporting that they had not received a clinician's recommendation for endoscopy or home FOBT increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A lack of information, no clinician recommendation, misconceptions, and worry persist as barriers to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening among this underscreened urban population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increased focus on clinician recommendation and patient education about stool-based as well as endoscopic screening methods could lead to greater screening compliance </plain></SENT>
