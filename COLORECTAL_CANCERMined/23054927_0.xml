<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of EHRs on ambulatory quality is unclear, with several large studies finding no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of EHRs on ambulatory quality in a community-based setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, using data from 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Ambulatory practices in the Hudson Valley of New York, with a median practice size of four physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> general internists, pediatricians and family medicine physicians who: were members of the Taconic Independent Practice Association, had patients in a data set of claims aggregated across five health plans, and had at least 30 patients per measure for at least one of nine quality measures selected by the health plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IINTERVENTION: Adoption of an EHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared physicians using EHRs to physicians using paper on performance for each of the nine quality measures, using t-tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also created a composite quality score by standardizing performance against a national benchmark and averaging standardized performance across measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We used generalized estimation equations, adjusting for nine physician characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: We included 466 physicians and 74,618 unique patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the physicians, 204 (44 %) had adopted EHRs and 262 (56 %) were using paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Electronic health record use was associated with significantly higher quality of care for four of the measures: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c testing in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening, chlamydia screening, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Effect sizes ranged from 3 to 13 percentage points per measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine measures were combined into a composite, EHR use was associated with higher quality of care (sd 0.4, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to find a positive association between EHRs and ambulatory quality in a community-based setting </plain></SENT>
