<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its therapy, although considerably improved, continues to be unhelpful for a large percentage of patients, especially for those in advanced stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This justifies the efforts toward producing new therapies, as well as for stratifying patients according to risk factors and prediction of therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this respect, the contributions of modern science are essential for defining the most intimate mechanisms and players of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and for proposing new biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study of antitumor immune responses has revealed new insights into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment, leading to the development of vaccines and adoptive transfer of immunocompetent cells </plain></SENT>
