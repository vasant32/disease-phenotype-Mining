<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined patients factors associated with inadequate flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSG) screening at baseline screening and repeat screening 3-5 years later in 10 geographically-dispersed screening centers participating in the ongoing Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ovarian Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 64,554 participants (aged 55-74) completed baseline questionnaires and underwent FSG at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 39,385 participants returned for repeat screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression models to assess factors that are associated with inadequate FSG (defined as a study in which the depth of insertion of FSG was &lt;50 cm or visual inspection was limited to &lt;90% of the mucosal surface but without detection of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> or mass) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 7084 (11%) participants with inadequate FSG at baseline, 6496 (91.7%) had &lt;50 cm depth of insertion (75.3% due to patient discomfort) and 500 (7.1%) participants had adequate depth of insertion but suboptimal bowel preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to 55-59 year age group, advancing age in 5-year increments (odds ratios (OR) from 1.08 to 1.51) and female sex (OR = 2.40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.27-2.54) were associated with inadequate FSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m(2)) was associated with reduced odds (OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.62-0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inadequate FSG screening at baseline was associated with inadequate FSG at repeat screening (OR = 6.24; 95% CI: 5.78-6.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sedation should be considered for patients with inadequate FSG or an alternative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening method should be recommended </plain></SENT>
