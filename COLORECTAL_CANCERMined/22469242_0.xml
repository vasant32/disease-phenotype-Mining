<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to explore the ability of preclinical imaging modalities to detect experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine male Wag/Rij rats underwent a laparotomy with intraportal injection of CC531 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On days 7, 10, and 14 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> induction, sequential <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired of each rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At each time point, three rats were euthanized and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in the liver were documented histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Topographically, the liver was divided into eight segments and the image findings were compared on a segment-by-segment basis with the histopathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four liver segments were analyzed, 20 of which contained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall sensitivity of PET, CT, and MRI was 30%, 25%, and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a histologic diameter exceeding 1 mm (n  =  8), the sensitivity of PET, CT, and MRI was 63%, 38%, and 38%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall specificity of PET, CT, and MRI was 98%, 100%, and 93%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study showed encouraging detectability and sensitivity for preclinical imaging of <z:mp ids='MP_0000601'>small liver</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and provides valuable information on the imaging techniques for designing future protocols </plain></SENT>
