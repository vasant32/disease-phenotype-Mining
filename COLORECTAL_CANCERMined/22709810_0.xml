<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Older adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors are at greater risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> and other comorbidities that can be prevented through improved diet and weight management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The tertiary prevention needs of rural-dwelling survivors can be even greater, yet little is known about rural and urban differences in lifestyle factors among this high-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare dietary patterns of urban and rural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors and to examine associations of dietary patterns with body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A secondary analysis was performed of baseline data from the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial, a diet and exercise intervention among overweight, long-term (â‰¥5 years), older survivors of colorectal, breast, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survivors in the present analysis (n=729) underwent two 45- to 60-minute telephone surveys, which included two 24-hour dietary recalls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Principal components analysis and multivariable general linear models were used to derive dietary patterns and to evaluate associations between dietary patterns and BMI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Principal components analysis identified three primary dietary patterns among rural dwellers (high sweets and starches, high reduced-fat dairy, cereal, nuts, and fruits, and mixed) and three among urban dwellers (high fruits and vegetables, high meat and refined grains, and high sugar-sweetened beverages) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among rural survivors, greater adherence to the high reduced-fat dairy, cereal, nuts, and fruits pattern was positively associated with lower BMI (P trend &lt;0.05), whereas higher scores on the mixed pattern was associated with greater BMI (P trend &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Greater adherence to the high fruits and vegetables pattern among urban survivors was inversely associated with BMI (P trend &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urban and rural differences in dietary intake behavior should be considered in designing public health interventions among the increasing population of older <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, targeting overall dietary patterns might be one approach to help reduce the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> among this population </plain></SENT>
