<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) under clinical suspicion for a hereditary cause, the disease-causing genetic factors are still to be discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify such genetic factors we stringently selected a discovery cohort of 41 CRC index patients with microsatellite-stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were below 40 years of age at diagnosis and/or exhibited an overt family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We employed genome-wide copy number profiling using high-resolution SNP arrays on germline DNA, which resulted in the identification of novel copy number variants (CNVs) in six patients (15%) encompassing, among others, the cadherin gene CDH18, the bone morphogenetic protein <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> family gene GREM1, and the breakpoint cluster region gene BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, two genomic deletions were encountered encompassing two microRNA genes, hsa-mir-491/KIAA1797 and hsa-mir-646/AK309218 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of these CNVs has previously been reported in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> predisposition in humans, nor were they encountered in large control cohorts (&gt;1,600 unaffected individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since several of these newly identified candidate genes may be functionally linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development, our results illustrate the potential of this approach for the identification of novel candidate genes involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> predisposition </plain></SENT>
