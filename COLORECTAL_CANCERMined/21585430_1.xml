<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the inter-observer variation in the histological diagnosis of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred and forty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were randomly selected from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> were first evaluated by a general (324 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>) or expert (116 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>) pathologist, and subsequently re-evaluated by an expert pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditional agreement was reported, and inter-observer agreement was determined using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 421/440 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (96%), agreement for their non-adenomatous or adenomatous nature was obtained, corresponding to a very good kappa value of 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> as non-advanced and advanced, consensus was obtained in 266/322 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (83%), with a moderate kappa value of 0.58 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the non-adenomatous or adenomatous nature, both general and expert pathologists, and expert pathologists between each other, showed very good agreement {kappa values of 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.95] and 0.86 (95% CI 0.73-0.98), respectively} </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For categorization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> as non-advanced and advanced, moderate agreement was found between general and expert pathologists, and between expert pathologists [kappa values of 0.56 (95% CI 0.44-0.67) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.43-0.85), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: General and expert pathologists demonstrate very good inter-observer agreement for differentiating non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, but only moderate agreement for non-advanced and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The considerable variation in differentiating non-advanced and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> suggests that more objective criteria are required for risk stratification in screening and surveillance guidelines </plain></SENT>
