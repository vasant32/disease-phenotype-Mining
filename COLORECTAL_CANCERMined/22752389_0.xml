<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the modulatory potential of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> on colonic surface abnormalities and membrane fluidity changes following 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) induced colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were segregated into four groups viz., <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control, DMH treated, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> treated, and DMH + <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initiation of molecular events leading to colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> was started following weekly subcutaneous injections of DMH (30 mg/Kg body weight) for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">Selenium</z:chebi> in the form of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="48843">sodium selenite</z:chebi> was supplemented to rats at a dose level of 1 PPM in drinking water, ad libitum for the entire duration of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brush border membranes were isolated from the colon of rats and the viscosity as well as fluidity parameters were assessed using the membrane extrinsic fluorophore <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39106">pyrene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DMH treatment resulted in a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels (GSH) and the activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase (GR), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> transferase (GST), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx) were found to be significantly decreased following DMH treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, supplementation with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> to DMH treated rats resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation but caused a significant increase in the levels of GSH as well in the activities of GR, GST, SOD, CAT, and GPx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results further, demonstrated a marked decrease in membrane microviscosity following DMH treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a significant increase was observed in the excimer/monomer ratio and fluidity parameter of DMH treated rats when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the alterations in membrane microviscosity and the fluidity parameters were significantly restored following <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further, histological as well as colon surface alterations were also observed following DMH treatment, which however were greatly prevented upon <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> co-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study, therefore, concludes that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> proves as a useful in modulating the colonic surface abnormalities and membrane stability following DMH induced colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
