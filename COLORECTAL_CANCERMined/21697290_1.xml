<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The guidelines of the Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath) state that, in a series of resections, extramural VI should be detected in at least 25% of specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is widespread variability in the reported incidence, and this may affect patient access to adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aims to clarify the current practice patterns of pathologists regarding the assessment of VI and to identify factors associated with an increased self-reported VI detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based survey was mailed to 361 pathologists in the province of Ontario, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 64.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most pathologists were practicing in community-based centres (66.2%) and approximately half had been in practice for over 15 years (53.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subspecialist interest in gastrointestinal (GI) pathology was declared by 27.3% of pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of pathologists (70.2%) reported that they detected VI in less than 10% of resection specimens, with only 9.1% reporting VI detection rates above 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Standardised reporting criteria were applied by 62.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Special stains were employed by 57.6% if VI was suspected on H&amp;E-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Practice in a university-affiliated centre, a subspecialist interest in GI pathology and the acceptance of the 'orphan arteriole' sign were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> independently associated with a self-reported VI detection rate above 10% on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported VI detection rates are low among most pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even among specialist GI pathologists practicing in university-affiliated centres, few reported a detection rate close to that recommended by the RCPath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Strategies to increase the detection of VI may be required </plain></SENT>
