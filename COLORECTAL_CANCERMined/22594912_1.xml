<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Established or suspected dietary factors modifying risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are red meat, cereals, fish, and fibre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diet and lifestyle may be linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> through <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We wanted to test if dietary factors and IL10 polymorphisms interact in relation to colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The functional IL10 polymorphism C-592A (rs1800872) and the marker rs3024505 were assessed in relation to diet and lifestyle in a nested case-cohort study of 378 CRC cases and 775 randomly selected participants from a prospective study of 57,053 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotyping data on the IL10 polymorphism C-592A, smoking and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) was retrieved from Vogel et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(Mutat Res, 2007; 624:88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No associations were found between the IL10 rs3024505 polymorphism and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was interaction between rs3024505 and dietary fibre (P-value for interaction = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IL10 rs3024505 homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> carriers were at 27% reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> per 10 g fibre per day (95% CI: 0.60-0.88) whereas variant carriers had no risk reduction by fibre intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also, interaction between IL10 C-592A and intake of fibre was found (P-value for interaction = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among those eating &lt;17.0 grams of fibre per day, carriers of an C-592A variant allele had a statistically significantly higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared to homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtypes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk were observed between the reference group (CC and &lt;17.0 g/day) and carriers of one C-592A variant allele eating 17.0 or more grams of dietary fibre per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the increased risk due to carrying the variant allele can be overcome by higher fibre intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No interactions between IL10 polymorphisms and dietary meat, cereal, or fish intake, or between IL10 rs3024505 and smoking or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this northern Caucasian cohort we found interaction between IL10 and dietary fibre in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>High intake of fibre seems to protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among individuals with IL10 related genetic susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This finding should be evaluated in other prospective and population-based cohorts with different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
