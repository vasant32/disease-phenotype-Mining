<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence in the past few years has shown that miRNAs could serve functionally as "oncogenes" or "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes" and regulate multiple cellular processes relevant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both RhoA and Cdc42, two members of the Rho GTPase family, are found to be upregulated in several types of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and have been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> initiation and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present studies, we found that miR-185 expression greatly inhibited the proliferation potential of Hela cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An examination of the predicted targets of miR-185 revealed RhoA and Cdc42 among the putative targets that are crucial for cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A genomic sequence analysis indicated that nt 1844-1852 of the RhoA 3'UTR and nt 1382-1396 of the cdc42 3'UTR encode for miR-185 target matching sequences and they are highly conserved across different species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a luciferase-reporter assay, we show that miR-185 expression significantly suppressed the RhoA and Cdc42 3'UTR activities, and the inhibitory effect was lost when the putative target sites for miR-185 were mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these results, ectopic expression of miR-185 reduced protein levels of RhoA and Cdc42 in cells, indicating miR-185 functionally regulates RhoA and Cdc42 abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar to the effects of knocking down RhoA and/or Cdc42 expression, miR-185 effectively inhibited proliferation, induced G1 cell cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and blocked invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, miR-185 is a negative regulator of RhoA and Cdc42 and their cellular activities, and could inhibit proliferation and invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
