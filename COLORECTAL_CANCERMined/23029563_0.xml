<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Down-regulation of E-cadherin (CDH1) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are considered critical events for invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we tested whether the important regulators of E-cadherin expression SNAI1 and TWIST1 are already detectable in human colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from a set of randomly selected formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (n = 41) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of CDH1, CDH2, SNAI1 and TWIST1 was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CDH1 as well as SNAI1 protein expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SNAI1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in 78% (n = 32/41), TWIST1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 41% (n = 17/41) and CDH2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 41% (n = 17/41) of the colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> tissue, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa was negative for these transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a significant correlation between reduced CDH1 and the presence of SNAI1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and for combined SNAI1 and TWIST1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A correlation between CDH2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and reduced CDH1 expression was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the relationship between SNAI1 expression and reduced E-cadherin expression on the protein level via IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that SNAI1 and Twist1 are already expressed in benign precursor lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and that SNAI1 expression was significantly correlated with lower expression of CDH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether these findings reflect true EMT and/or are a sign of a more aggressive biology need to be investigated in further studies </plain></SENT>
