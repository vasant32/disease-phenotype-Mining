<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) regulates morphogenic growth of benign MDCK (Madin Darby Canine Kidney) cells through effects on the Rho-like GTPase cdc42 (cell division cycle 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates PTEN-dependent morphogenesis in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> model </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parental Caco-2 cells formed regular hollow gland-like structures (glands) with a single central lumen, in three-dimensional (3D) cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, PTEN-deficient Caco-2 ShPTEN cells formed irregular glands with multiple abnormal lumens as well as intra- and/or intercellular vacuoles evocative of the high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effects of targeted treatment were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phosphatidinylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) modulating treatment did not affect gland morphogenesis but did influence gland number, gland size and/or cell size within glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As PTEN may be regulated by the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), cultures were treated with the PPARγ ligand <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
