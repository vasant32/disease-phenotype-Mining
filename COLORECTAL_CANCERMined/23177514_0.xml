<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: No treatment options are available for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> that progresses after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> approved standard therapies, but many patients maintain a good performance status and could be candidates for further therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An international phase 3 trial was done to assess the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We did this trial at 114 centres in 16 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and progression during or within 3 months after the last standard therapy were randomised (in a 2:1 ratio; by computer-generated randomisation list and interactive voice response system; preallocated block design (block size six); stratified by previous treatment with VEGF-targeting drugs, time from diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, and geographical region) to receive best supportive care plus oral regorafenib 160 mg or placebo once daily, for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study sponsor, participants, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01103323 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Between April 30, 2010, and March 22, 2011, 1052 patients were screened, 760 patients were randomised to receive regorafenib (n=505) or placebo (n=255), and 753 patients initiated treatment (regorafenib n=500; placebo n=253; population for safety analyses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of overall survival was met at a preplanned interim analysis; data cutoff was on July 21, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 6·4 months in the regorafenib group versus 5·0 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·77; 95% CI 0·64-0·94; one-sided p=0·0052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 465 (93%) patients assigned regorafenib and in 154 (61%) of those assigned placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events of grade three or higher related to regorafenib were hand-foot skin reaction (83 patients, 17%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (48, 10%), diarrhoea (36, 7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (36, 7%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> or desquamation (29, 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Regorafenib is the first small-molecule multikinase inhibitor with survival benefits in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> which has progressed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> standard therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The present study provides evidence for a continuing role of targeted treatment after disease progression, with regorafenib offering a potential new line of therapy in this treatment-refractory population </plain></SENT>
