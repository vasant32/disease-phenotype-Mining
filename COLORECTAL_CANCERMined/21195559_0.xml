<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative pain contributes to dysfunction of immune response as a result of interaction between central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> and immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postoperatively activated hypotalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, sympathic and parasympathic nerve systems are important modulators of immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to bidirectional communication of immune and <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, appropriate postoperative pain management could affect immune response in postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the postoperative suppression of immune response has been reported, a very little are known about the influences of different pain management techniques on cytotoxic function of immune cells in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perforin is a cytotoxic molecule expressed by activated lymphocytes which has a crucial role in elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and virus-infected cells, mostly during the effector's phase of immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immune compromise during the postoperative period could affect the healing processes, incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postoperative infections</z:e> and rate and size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> disseminated during operation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For decades the most common way of treating postoperative pain after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery was intravenous <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> with opiods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the last decade many investigations pointed out that opiods can also contribute to postoperative suppression of immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epidural <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> is a regional anesthesia technique that acts directly on the origin of pain impulses and pain relief can be achieved with small doses of opiods combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">local anesthetics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Afferent neural blockade by epidural <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> attenuates neuroendocrine stress response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We propose that epidural <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> could be more convenient that intravenous <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> in maintenance of immunological homeostasis that is altered by surgical stress, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and pain </plain></SENT>
