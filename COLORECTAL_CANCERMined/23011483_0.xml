<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aspirin has been widely reported to reduce the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a survival benefit after diagnosis has also been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data regarding such a benefit are to date contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examines the effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) use on mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a larger patient cohort than previously to further clarify this effect, especially in terms of exposure timing and dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A study using the General Practice Research Database assessed whether aspirin or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> exposure in the year immediately following diagnosis affected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in a cohort of 13 994 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards modelling adjusted for age, gender, smoking, body mass index and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall mortality was slightly lower in patients treated with aspirin, (hazard ratio (HR)=0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.82-1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was observed only in patients treated with prophylaxis-dose aspirin (HR=0.89, CI=0.80-0.98) and only in patients taking aspirin before diagnosis (HR=0.86, CI=0.76-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differential effects were observed depending on the time after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Up to 5 years, a reduction in mortality was observed for aspirin users (HR=0.83, CI=0.75-0.92), whereas after 10 years there was an increase in mortality (HR=1.94, CI=1.26-2.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use, no significant effect was observed on overall mortality (HR=1.07, CI=0.98-1.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use was associated with a slight increase in mortality (HR=1.41, CI=1.26-1.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These findings provide further indication that aspirin may be beneficial in reducing mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during the first 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The same cannot be said for other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>, where a small increase in mortality was observed </plain></SENT>
