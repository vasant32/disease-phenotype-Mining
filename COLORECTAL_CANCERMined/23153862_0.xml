<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our aims were to evaluate adherence to guidelines on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surveillance and outcomes for patients enrolled in an innovative follow-up program at our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Cross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute in Edmonton, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who completed treatment and who entered into the program from December 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The minimum standard of care follow-up was defined as (1) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing every 120 days for 3 years; (2) computed tomography of chest, abdomen, and pelvis at 10 to 14 months and 22 to 26 months after surgery; and (3) colonoscopy within 14 months of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 408 patients met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred (49.0%) patients were adherent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 components of surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 57 (14.0%) were nonadherent to computed tomography imaging, 135 (33.1%) were nonadherent to colonoscopy, and 96 (23.5%) were nonadherent to CEA testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Determinants of nonadherence are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, 192 (47.2%) patients had an abnormal surveillance investigation that led to 307 follow-up events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median of 1.6 years, 69 (16.9%) patients had documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one (88.4%) of these 69 patients had recurrence diagnosed via surveillance, and 31 (44.9%) patients were considered potentially resectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated an improvement in CEA testing since the program began; however, adherence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> components are not yet optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Alterations to surveillance program management are outlined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further investigation will determine whether intense follow-up improves patient survival locally </plain></SENT>
