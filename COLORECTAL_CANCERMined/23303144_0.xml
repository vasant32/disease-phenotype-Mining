<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, it was reported that postmenopausal women with lower bone mineral density have an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An association between lower bone mineral density and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> suggests that colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, which is a precursor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, may also be associated with lower bone mineral density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the association between colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study between January 2007 and May 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women older than 50 years of age who underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for bone mineral density and screening colonoscopy at Gangdong Kyung Hee University Hospital in Korea during a routine health checkup were eligible for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed multivariate analysis adjusted for age, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, alcohol consumption, current smoking, regular aspirin use, exercise, menopause, and postmenopausal hormone use to identify independent predictors for the presence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was the prevalence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> according to the bone mineral density level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 992 women older than 50 years were assigned to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> group (n = 231) or a control group (n = 231) after menopause matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, the proportion of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> group than in the control group (29.9% vs 20.8%, p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> (OR = 1.592, 95% CI = 1.004-2.524, p = 0.048) was found to be an independent risk factor for the presence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>Osteoporosis</z:hpo> is associated with an increased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in women older than 50 years </plain></SENT>
