<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases occur in the second decade of life and are clinically aggressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of these patients is generally poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective study in which data of Indian patients was compared to standard literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on 32 young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between ages of 10-25 years treated between January 2000 and December 2006 was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation, natural history and response to therapy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Studied cases comprised 9.9% of the total number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age of presentation was 21.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four-fifths of the cases presented in late stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nodal involvement was seen in 38% cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> in 12% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rectum was the most commonly involved site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A majority of the patients presented with pain (81%), altered bowel habits (72%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> per rectum (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgery was done in 16 cases; radiotherapy in 16 patients; while chemotherapy was used in 19 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Responses at completion of treatment were seen in 28% cases; while 1 year post treatment only 12% cases were alive and only 6% at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> in younger age is rare and a high level of suspicion is necessary to diagnose it at an early and curable stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>Rectal bleeding</z:hpo> therefore should not be ignored but evaluated further with at least a digital rectal examination and a sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Failure to do so results in late presentation with consequent dismal survival rates </plain></SENT>
