<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rate of serious complications of colonoscopy according to colonoscopy indication and polypectomy status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients scheduled for colonoscopy who were recruited from seven endoscopy facilities across Montreal (Quebec) was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before colonoscopy, patients completed a brief questionnaire and provided their health insurance numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy indication was based on patient-reported medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polypectomy status was obtained from provincial physician billing records (Régie de l'assurance maladie <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> Québec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses and procedures associated with hospitalization in the 30 days following colonoscopy were obtained from the provincial hospitalization database (MedEcho) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 2134 patients enrolled (mean age 60.9 years, 50.1% male), 33 (1.55% [95% CI 1.06% to 2.16%]) were hospitalized within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> following a colonoscopy that involved polypectomy and was diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ of the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> in the previous six months, the colonoscopy was nonscreening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The provincial hospitalization data showed no occurrences of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>⁄<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; thus, the rate of serious colonoscopy complications was 0.05% (95% CI 0.00% to 0.26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The rate of serious colonoscopy complications requiring hospitalization was low and comparable with what is reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The serious complication occurred subsequent to polypectomy and in a nonscreening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings support the relative safety of screening colonoscopy in persons without large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel diseases</z:e> and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, future research to determine the rate of serious complications not requiring hospitalization is warranted to reassure decision makers of the safety of colonoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
