<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:   A substantial percentage of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> present with obstructive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In such patients, surgery is often required and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colorectal stenting is an increasingly commonplace alternative with potentially fewer risks than open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present our clinical experience over an 8-year period with colorectal stenting in a major tertiary Australian hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:   From 2000 to 2008, patients undergoing colorectal stenting were identified via medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data collected included patient demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> type, extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, stent characteristics, technical and clinical success, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications, and long-term follow-up status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   Thirty-five patients (69 ± 13 years, 25 male) received a total of 39 stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Technical success was achieved in 37 (95%), and clinical relief of obstruction was achieved in 34 (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One case was complicated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> at the time of procedure and three cases experienced delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reintervention was required in 17% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had less than 50% hepatic volume replacement by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:   Colorectal stenting is a feasible and safe alternative for patients presenting with obstructive symptoms but the benefit may be restricted to patients with a short expected survival </plain></SENT>
