<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cost-effective and easy methods to determine K-ras mutations are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples from 31 patients were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In laboratory 1, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples (n=31) were additionally tested using a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in laboratory 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results were confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first run, a concordance of real-time PCR and RFLP was observed in 77.4% (24 of 31) of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After resampling and reevaluation, a concordance of 93.5% (30 of 31) could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of 7 (6.5%) initial discordant cases showed a mutation using real-time PCR and no mutation using RFLP, but the mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR and RFLP can be considered as valid K-ras mutation detection techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in patient probes with lower amounts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> K-ras, reanalysis of further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue is recommended </plain></SENT>
