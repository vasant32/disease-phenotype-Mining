<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Traditionally, left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> is treated by a staged procedure because immediate resection and anastomosis in a massive distended and unprepared colon carries a high complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total abdominal colectomy is a one-stage procedure that will remove synchronous proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, reduce the risk of subsequent metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and avoid stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colorectal stents are being used for palliation and as a bridge to surgery in obstructing colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, making elective surgery straightforward, enabling easily mobilization and resection of the colon with a possible trend toward reduction in postoperative complication rates compared to emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work was to compare the procedures of endoscopic stenting followed by elective colectomy versus total abdominal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> obstructed <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the left colon as regards feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes METHODS: From January 2009 through May 2012, 60 patients were randomized to either emergency stenting followed by elective resection (ESER group) or total abdominal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (TACIR group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty nine patients (96.7 %) had successful stenting and underwent elective surgery 7-10 days later (ESER group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were encountered in four patients in the ESER group compared to 15 patients in the TACIR group (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic leakage was encountered in one patient (3.3 %) in the TACIR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no operative mortalities in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the first three postoperative months, the TACIR group patients had significantly more frequent bowel motions per day compared to the ESER group patients although (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both study groups, the follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 40 months with a median of 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent disease</z:e> was encountered in five patients (17.2 %) in the ESER group compared to four patients (13.3 %) in the TACIR group (p = 0.228) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both techniques are feasible, safe, and produce comparable oncological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, endoscopic stenting followed by elective resection was associated with significantly less postoperative complications and bowel motions per day </plain></SENT>
