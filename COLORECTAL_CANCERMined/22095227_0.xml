<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To establish the procedures to identify responders to FOLFOX therapy, 83 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients including 42 responders and 41 non-responders were divided into training (54 patients) and test (29 patients) sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using Random Forests (RF) algorithm in the training set, predictor genes for FOLFOX therapy were identified, which were applied to test samples and sensitivity, specificity, and out-of-bag classification accuracy were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the training set, 22 of 27 responders (81.4% sensitivity) and 23 of 27 non-responders (85.1% specificity) were correctly classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To improve the prediction model, we removed the outliers determined by RF, and the model could correctly classify 21 of 23 responders (91.3%) and 22 of 23 non-responders (95.6%) in the training set, and 80.0% sensitivity and 92.8% specificity, with an accuracy of 69.2% in 29 independent test samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Random Forests on gene-expression data for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was effectively able to stratify responders to FOLFOX therapy with high accuracy, and use of pharmacogenomics in anticancer therapy is the first step in planning personalised therapy </plain></SENT>
