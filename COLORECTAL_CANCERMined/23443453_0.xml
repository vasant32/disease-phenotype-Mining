<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of unknown staged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases varies considerably across state <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries; factors contributing to the variations in unknown stage have not been reported in the literature before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine whether these variations were influenced by demographic and/or clinical factors as well as the type of reporting facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: Invasive colorectal, lung, female breast, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 were obtained from the North American Association of Central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registries (NAACCR); 47 population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries in the United States were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unknown stage was based on Summary Stage 2000 codes derived from Collaborative Stage Version 1 (CSv1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative importance analysis was used to identify variables that were essential in predicting unknown stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using state central registries as analytical units, multiple linear regression was used to evaluate factors associated with the percentage of unknown stage by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site; potential outlier registries with a high percentage of unknown stage cases were identified using boxplots and standardized residuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: Overall, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> had the highest percentage of unknown stage (8.3%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> had the largest variation of unknown stage among registries (0.6%-18.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> not otherwise specified (NOS) histology, non-microscopic confirmation, and non-hospital reporting source were positively associated (p less than 0.05) with percentage of unknown stage for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites before adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Variables that retained a positive association with unknown stage including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demographic and clinical variables, year of diagnosis, and type of reporting source were black race, metropolitan area less than 1 million population, histologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> NOS or epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> NOS, diagnosis year 2005, and non-hospital reporting source for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; metropolitan area less than 1 million population, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> NOS histology, and non-hospital reporting source for female breast; and diagnosis year 2005 and non-hospital reporting source for prostate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, none of the predictors were significant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed 1 potential outlier registry each for colorectal, lung and female <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Factors associated with unknown stage differ by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site; however, the type of reporting source is an important predictor of unknown stage for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> except lung after adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Central registries with high percentage of unknown stage should be made aware of their data quality issue(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As a result, these registries can investigate those factors and provide training to registrars to improve their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> data quality </plain></SENT>
