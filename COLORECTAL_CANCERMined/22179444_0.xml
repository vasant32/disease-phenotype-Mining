<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper aims to fill this gap by providing economic information on this research topic of growing relevance at a time of reduced healthcare budgets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three Italian reference centres retrospectively provided from their databases data on 90 cases of laparotomy (OP) or laparoscopy (LAP) interventions for right colon (RCol), left colon/sigma (LCol) and rectum (Rec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Costs were retrieved according to phases of the in-hospital procedure: pre-operative, operative and post-operative phase, including diagnostic work-up, hospital length of stay, duration of intervention, theatre occupation time, type of anaesthesia, medical devices and drugs used and staff time throughout the management process from hospital admission to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cost estimation was carried out using a microcosting, bottom-up technique, and statistical analysis was carried out using appropriate techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average cost of colorectal surgery was euro 10,539/patient (median euro 10,396) with rectum procedures being statistically more costly than colon procedures (mean Rec euro 12,562/patient versus LCol euro 9,054 and RCol euro 10,002; median euro 11,704 versus euro 8,941 and euro 9,513, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average cost per patient did not differ between the two procedures for colon interventions, whereas a statistically significant difference was found for rectum procedures (LAP euro 11,617 versus OP euro 13,506; median euro 11,563 versus euro 12,568; p = 0.0442) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The national diagnosis related groups (DRG) tariff is insufficient to remunerate the providers' activity, irrespective of the type of disease (surgical site) and surgical technique adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery is a costly procedure, and in-patient DRG tariffs are currently insufficient to cover the cost of its management for Italian hospital providers </plain></SENT>
