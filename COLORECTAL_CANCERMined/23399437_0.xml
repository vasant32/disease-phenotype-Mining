<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 8844 citizens aged 50-75 were randomly invited to colonoscopy (n=5924) or CT-colonography (n=2920) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> invitees received an information leaflet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screenees received a questionnaire within 4 weeks before the planned examination, non-screenees 4 weeks after the invitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decision was categorized as informed when characterized by sufficient decision-relevant knowledge and consistent with personal attitudes toward participation in screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Knowledge and attitude items were completed by 1032/1276 colonoscopy screenees (81%), by 698/4648 colonoscopy non-screenees (15%), by 824/982 CT-colonography screenees (84%) and by 192/1938 CT-colonography non-screenees (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1027 colonoscopy screenees (&gt;99%) and 815 CT-colonography screenees (99%) had adequate knowledge; 915 (89%) and 742 (90%) had a positive attitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>675 non-screenees invited to colonoscopy (97%) and 182 invited to CT-colonography (95%) had adequate knowledge; 344 (49%) and 94 (49%) expressed a negative attitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A large majority of screenees made an informed decision on participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Almost half of responding non-screenees, made an uninformed decision, suggesting additional barriers to participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Efforts to understand the additional barriers will create opportunities to facilitate informed participation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
