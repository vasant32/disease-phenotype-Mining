<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of targeted genetic testing and surveillance programs in individuals at high risk of hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC), as compared to an unselective clinical surveillance program alone in Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Markov model analysis from the healthcare service provider's perspective was developed to follow over a lifetime a cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free 21-year-old individuals, who were first-degree relatives of HNPCC patients with a known mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing strategy provided a lifetime saving of Singapore dollars (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SGD</z:e>) 13,588 per person and gained additional life years of 0.01, as compared to clinical surveillance alone, by sparing non-mutation carriers from unnecessary and invasive intensive clinical surveillance (assuming 100% compliance with recommended surveillance programs in both strategies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses showed that as long as the compliance rate in mutation carriers was not lower than that for individuals without genetic testing, pursuing a genetic testing strategy would either be a more favorable option with discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SGD</z:e> 6,961 to 17,289 per life year gained or a dominant status achieved (more life year gained and less costly) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing for individuals at high risk of HNPCC allows targeted clinical surveillance to be directed at mutation carriers, ensuring efficient use of healthcare resources and reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can be regarded as a cost-effective strategy in Singapore, if an improved compliance with recommended surveillance protocol is achieved in proven mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
