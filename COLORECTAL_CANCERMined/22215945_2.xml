<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were retrospectively collected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were aged 50 years and older and had a first-time diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between the period 2005 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The controls were matched to cases by age, sex, and index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We examined 1156 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 4624 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted ORs for any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> prescription was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.94-1.30) and the adjusted OR was 1.09 (95% CI = 0.91-1.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use was categorized by cumulative dose, the adjusted ORs were 0.99 (95% CI = 0.78-1.27) for the group with cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use below 105 defined daily doses (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDDs</z:chebi>); 1.07 (95% CI = 0.78-1.49) for the group with cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use between 106 and 298.66 DDDs; and 1.30 (95% CI = 0.96-1.75) for the group with cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use of 298.66 DDDs or more compared with nonusers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study does not provide support for a protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
