<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> in Wales was introduced in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared patient variables, the role of surgery and operative mortality rates over the 15-year interval between the WTBA and the last WBCA before the introduction population screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method:  Data from the WTBA in 1993 were compared with those of the WBCA including patients diagnosed between April 2007 and March 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results:  In 1993, 1536 patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) against 1793 in 2007/8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> did not change during these periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> declined (93% in 1993 vs 80% in 2007/8 (p&lt;0.001) particularly in the use of resectional surgery (84% in 1993 vs 71% in 2007/8; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 30-day postoperative mortality rate fell from 7.4% in 1993 to 5.9% in 2007/8, (p=0.097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Advanced disease at operation was more prevalent in the WTBA (25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> operated patients were Stage IV in 1993 vs 13% in 2007/8 [p&lt;0.001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> also declined over this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  Surgery is used less frequently in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with fifteen years previously. and is a factor in the reduction of the interpreted thirty-day operative mortality. © 2012 The Authors Colorectal Disease © 2012 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland </plain></SENT>
