<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By better understanding the role of the angiogenic pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), new therapies have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab, the first anti-angiogenetic agent approved for the treatment of mCRC provide a proof of concept since it has improved the progression-free survival and overall survival when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: This review is focused on the most recent findings on the VEGF signaling pathway and new therapeutic drugs explored in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Despite the advantage offered by bevacizumab, the median overall survival of mCRC patient exceeds 21 months; thus, investigational efforts are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several antiangiogenic agents for the treatment of mCRC are being tested in preclinical and clinical Phase I/II trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately a discrete number of Phase III trials produced negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recently aflibercept and regorafenib, two new antiangiogenic drugs, have been approved as the new-targeted agents for the treatment of mCRC, according to the positive findings from the VELOUR and the CORRECT studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to maximize clinical impact it will be important to validate predictive biomarkers and best combination treatments to offer for mCRC patients; further research and intense investigation is still required </plain></SENT>
