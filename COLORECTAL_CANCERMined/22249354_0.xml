<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> monophosphate synthetase (UMPS) is thought to be primarily responsible for conversion of 5-FU to active anticancer metabolites in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation or aberrant expression of UMPS may contribute to 5-FU resistance during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook a characterization of UMPS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isoform expression and sequence variation in 5-FU-resistant cell lines and drug-naive or -exposed primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed reciprocal differential expression of two UMPS isoforms in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line with acquired 5-FU resistance relative to the 5-FU-sensitive cell line from which it was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A novel isoform arising as a consequence of exon skipping was increased in abundance in resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanism responsible for this shift in isoform expression was determined to be a heterozygous splice site mutation acquired in the resistant cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We developed sequencing and expression assays to specifically detect alternative UMPS isoforms and used these to determine that UMPS was recurrently disrupted by mutations and aberrant splicing in additional 5-FU-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed mutations, aberrant splicing and downregulation of UMPS represent novel mechanisms for acquired 5-FU resistance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
