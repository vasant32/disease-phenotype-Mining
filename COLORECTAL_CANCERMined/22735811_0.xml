<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ESM-1 as an intracellular molecule in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ESM-1 expression was knocked down by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of ESM-1 siRNA decreased cell survival through the Akt-dependent inhibition of NF-κB/IκB pathway and an interconnected reduction in phospho-Akt, -p38, -ERK1, -RSK1, -GSK-3α/β and -HSP27, as determined by a phospho-MAPK array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ESM-1 silencing induced G(1) phase cell cycle arrest by induction of PTEN, resulting in the inhibition of cyclin D1 and inhibited cell migration and invasion of COLO205 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistently, ESM-1 overexpression in HCT-116 cells enhanced cell proliferation through the Akt-dependent activation of NF-κB pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, ESM-1 interacted with NF-κB and activated NF-κB promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that ESM-1 is involved in cell survival, cell cycle progression, migration, invasion and EMT during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, ESM-1 may be a useful therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
