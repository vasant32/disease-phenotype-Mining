<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We evaluated the prognostic and predictive use of circulating VEGF-A levels in phase III trials of bevacizumab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline plasma samples from 1,816 patients were analyzed for VEGF-A using an ELISA, which recognizes the major isoforms with equivalent sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for study end points were estimated using Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subset of matched archival <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples was analyzed for VEGF-A expression using in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher VEGF-A levels showed trends toward adverse prognostic significance in the control arms of multiple trials, reaching statistical significance for overall survival (OS) in AVF2107 (highest vs. lowest 50%: HR = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.28-2.41), AVAiL (HR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-2.00), and AVOREN (HR = 1.67; 95% CI, 1.18-2.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In predictive analyses, the HRs for progression-free survival were similar across low and high VEGF-A subgroups and favored bevacizumab-containing treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the low VEGF-A subgroups, HRs (95% CIs) were 0.61 (0.43-0.87) in AVF2107, 0.71 (0.43-1.16) in E4599, 0.74 (0.59-0.94) in AVAiL (low-dose), 0.89 (0.70-1.13) in AVAiL (high-dose), and 0.56 (0.40-0.78) in AVOREN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses of OS data have shown similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> VEGF-A expression and plasma VEGF-A levels was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive evaluation, pretreatment total circulating VEGF-A was prognostic for outcome in metastatic colorectal, lung, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007134" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">renal cell cancers</z:e>, but it was not predictive for bevacizumab-based treatment benefit </plain></SENT>
