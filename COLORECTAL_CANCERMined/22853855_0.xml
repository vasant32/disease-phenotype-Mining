<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One-stage, totally laparoscopic colorectal and minor liver resections have been reported, but there are no data regarding patients requiring simultaneous major hepatectomies and colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility and short-term outcomes of a small cohort of highly selected patients treated by 1-stage, totally laparoscopic major hepatectomy and colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2009 to July 2011, 5 patients (3 women and 2 men) with primary colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> and synchronous monolobar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> requiring a major hepatectomy underwent attempt of 1-stage, totally laparoscopic approach after neoadjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of prospective collected data was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no conversions to open procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients but 1 underwent a 1-stage laparoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among these, liver procedures were 3 right and 1 left hepatectomy; colonic procedures were 3 sigmoidectomies and 1 anterior resection of the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median operative time was 495 minutes, and duration of hospital stay, 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median estimated blood loss was 475 mL (range, 300-630) with no mortality observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An R0 resection was always achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 14 months (range, 7-20) with 1 recurrence observed in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In highly selected patients, a totally laparoscopic approach is a feasible and safe option to treat primary colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> requiring major hepatectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results need to be validated by larger, prospective, randomized studies </plain></SENT>
