<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Guanylyl cyclase C, a receptor for <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> diarrheagenic enterotoxins, is expressed selectively by intestinal epithelium and is an endogenous downstream target of CDX2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of Guanylyl cyclase C is preserved throughout the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in the colorectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection of Guanylyl cyclase C expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is currently being validated as a technique to identify occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and for circulating cells in the blood for postoperative surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although Guanylyl cyclase C is widely expressed by well-differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, its expression in poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A tissue microarray was created from 69 archival specimens including 44 poorly differentiated, 15 undifferentiated or medullary, and 10 signet ring cell colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa was used as a positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for Guanylyl cyclase C and CDX2 was evaluated as positive or negative based on at least a 10% extent of staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 69 tumor samples, 75%, 47%, and 90% of the poorly differentiated, medullary, and signet ring cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were positive for Guanylyl cyclase C and 75%, 40% and 90% of these subsets were positive for CDX2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was excellent correlation between Guanylyl cyclase C and CDX2 expression on a case-per-case basis (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also a statistically significant difference in the Guanylyl cyclase C staining pattern between medullary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and poorly differentiated, not otherwise specified (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunopositivity for Guanylyl cyclase C was greater than 95% in a separately stained microarray series of well/moderately differentiated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Guanylyl cyclase C expression is lost in a quarter of poorly differentiated and half of undifferentiated colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the utility of Guanylyl cyclase C expression as a diagnostic marker for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> may be questionable in poorly differentiated colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
