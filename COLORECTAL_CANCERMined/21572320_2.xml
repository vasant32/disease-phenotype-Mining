<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The identification of patients at increased risk of disease recurrence is currently based on pathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, there has been considerable interest in the potential impact of perioperative factors on long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Few studies have examined pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables in a single cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred and twenty-three patients with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent surgery with curative intent between 1997 and 2007 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of surgical complications and disease recurrence, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The postoperative mortality rate was 4% and the morbidity rate 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most important predictors of complications were smoking (odd ratio [OR] 1.32), <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade (OR 1.90) and POSSUM operative score (OR 1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow up (median 80 months), 35% of patients developed disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Predictors of recurrence, independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, were POSSUM <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31) and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> (HR 1.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative risk factors, but not postoperative complications, are associated with early disease recurrence after potentially curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
