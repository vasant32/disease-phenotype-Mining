<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: We show that detection, by week-2 magnetic resonance imaging, of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage &gt;10% in response to therapy with cetuximab or panitumumab for metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> represents an early indicator of clinical outcome because it is predictive of the prolongation of progression-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The early identification of patients with metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> who are likely to benefit from treatment with panitumumab or cetuximab remains of paramount importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether the early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is predictive of long-term outcome to these epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were treated with cetuximab or panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated by unenhanced MRI at baseline, week 2, and week 8 after the beginning of the treatment and by contrast-enhanced computed tomography within 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early response was defined as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage â‰¥ 10% at week-2 MRI, whereas response by contrast-enhanced computed tomography was defined according to standard Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> 1.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week-2 MRI, 15 (38.5%) of 39 patients had an early response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven (73.3%) of these 15 early responders then presented a partial response by contrast-enhanced computed tomography, whereas none of the 24 early nonresponders obtained a partial response (P &lt; .0005, Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 29.7 and 8 weeks in patients with or without early response, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.156 [95% CI, 0.069-0.355]; P &lt; .0001)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) was 80 weeks in patients with early response and 23.3 weeks in those without early response, respectively (HR 0.154 [95% CI, 0.057-0.420]; P &lt; .00005]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response by week-2 MRI without contrast medium is associated with a prediction of clinical outcome in patients with metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> treated with cetuximab or panitumumab </plain></SENT>
