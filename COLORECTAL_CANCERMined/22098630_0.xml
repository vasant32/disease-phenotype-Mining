<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colorectal laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (LST) &gt; 20 mm are usually treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection (EPMR) is sometimes required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to compare the outcomes of ESD and EMR, including EPMR, for such LST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 269 consecutive patients with a colorectal LST &gt; 20 mm were treated endoscopically at our hospital from April 2006 to December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the complications and local recurrence rates associated with ESD, hybrid ESD (ESD with EMR), EMR, and EPMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ESD and EMR were performed successfully for 89 and 178 LST, respectively: 61 by ESD; 28 by hybrid ESD; 70 by EMR; and 108 by EPMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between-group differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rates were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence rates in cases with curative resection were as follows: 0% (0/56) in ESD; 0% (0/27) in hybrid ESD; 1.4% (1/69) in EMR; and 12.1% (13/107) in EPMR; that is, significantly higher in EPMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was seen at follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate for EPMR yielding â‰¥ three pieces was significantly high (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 local recurrent lesions were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> that were cured endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As for safety, ESD/hybrid ESD is equivalent to EMR/EPMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ESD/hybrid ESD is a feasible technique for en bloc resection and showed no local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although local recurrences associated with EMR/EPMR were seen, which were conducted based on our indication criteria, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> local recurrences could obtain complete cure by additional endoscopic treatment </plain></SENT>
