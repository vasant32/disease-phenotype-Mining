<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The microspheres were prepared by double emulsion solvent evaporation method with natural polymer Assam Bora rice <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The microspheres were characterized for their micromeritics properties, incorporation efficiency, in vitro and in vivo drug release studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The release study confirmed the insignificant release of ITC-HCl in physiological condition of stomach and small intestine and major drug release in the caecal content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo release study of the optimized microsphere was compared with immediate release (IR) ITC-HCl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ITC-HCl was distributed predominantly in the upper GI tract from the IR, whereas ITC-HCl was distributed primarily to the lower part of GI tract from the microspheres formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced levels of liver enzymes were found in animals given IR ITC-HCl as well as augmented levels of serum albumin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, leucocytopenia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, Assam Bora rice <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> microspheres exhibit slow and extended release of ITC-HCl over longer periods of time with reduced systemic side-effects </plain></SENT>
