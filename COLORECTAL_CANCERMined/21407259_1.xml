<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed the impact of these polymorphisms on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in 748 French MMR mutation carriers derived from 359 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also analysed the effect of the Novel 1 SNP (18q21), which has recently been shown to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant difference in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-free survival time between males and females, between MSH2 and MSH6 mutation carriers and between MLH1 and MSH6, indicating that this series is representative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the univariate log-rank test, as well as multivariate Cox model analysis controlling for familial aggregation and mutated MMR gene, year of birth and gender showed that the polymorphic alleles tested were not associated with a significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk increase, neither on the entire sample nor among males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy with previous reports might be explained both by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> between the different populations analysed and the allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the MMR mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that genotyping of these polymorphisms is not useful to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in MMR mutation carriers and to optimize their clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
