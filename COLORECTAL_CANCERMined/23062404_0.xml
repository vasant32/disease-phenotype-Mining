<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed findings from 10,124 consecutive adults aged≥50 years who underwent screening colonoscopy to the cecum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We quantified the risk of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>≥1 cm, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> with villous histology or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) both proximally (cecum to splenic flexure) and distally (descending colon to anus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of advanced proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was quantified by age, gender, and distal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) age was 57.5 (6.0) years; 44% were women; 7835 (77%) had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and 1856 (18%) had 1 or more nonadvanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 433 subjects (4.3%) had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (267 distally, 196 proximally, 30 both), 33 (0.33%) of which were <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (18 distal, 15 proximal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of advanced proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> increased with age decade (1.13%, 2.00%, and 5.26%, respectively; P=.001) and was higher in men (relative risk [RR], 1.91; confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women aged less than 70 years, the risk was 1.1% overall (vs 2.2% in men; RR, 1.98; CI, 1.42-2.76) and 0.86% in those with no distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (vs 1.54% in men; RR, 1.81; CI, 1.20-2.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk of advanced proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is a function of age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women aged less than 60 to 70 years have a very low risk, particularly those with no distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sigmoidoscopy with or without occult blood testing may be sufficient and even preferable for screening these subgroups </plain></SENT>
