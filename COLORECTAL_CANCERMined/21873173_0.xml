<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess whether LCAP changed the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 42 patients with UC underwent surgical treatment from January 2001 until October 2010 at Kurume University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient details, preoperative therapy, operative indication and complications were obtained from our prospective database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate, multivariate analysis and tree model were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients who received LCAP before surgery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was significantly less frequent (p=0.0321) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence following LCAP increased when the disease period from diagnosis of UC exceeded 133 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the odds for undergoing LCAP were significantly higher (p=0.0305) in those cases with a total dose of steroid more than 2.57 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LCAP may suppress <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in UC patients </plain></SENT>
