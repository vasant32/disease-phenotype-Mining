<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Notch signalling pathway is activated in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the first steps in the Notch pathway activation is mediated by γ-secretase, a proteolytic enzyme which produces an activated intracellular Notch (ICN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RO4929097 is a selective inhibitor of γ-secretase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the activity of RO4929097 in patients with metastatic, refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who had received at least two prior lines of systemic chemotherapy were enrolled on the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with RO4929097 at its recommended phase II dose of 20mg daily, 3 days on and 4 days off continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cycle length was 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed every two cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Archival tissue specimens were stained immunohistochemically for components of the notch pathway: Notch1, ICN and the downstream target HES1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled of whom 33 were evaluable for toxicity and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of archival tissues demonstrated positive staining for the notch receptor as well as intracellular notch and the downstream gene HES1 in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, no objective radiographic responses were observed in this group and only six patients had stable disease as their best response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 1.8 months and median overall survival (OS) was 6.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study of RO4929097 in patients with refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, no radiographic responses were seen and time to progression was short, which suggests that RO4929097 at the study dose and schedule has minimal single agent activity in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
