<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine prospective associations of television viewing time with quality of life, following a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors were recruited through the Queensland <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interviews were conducted at 5, 12, 24, and 36 months post-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Generalized linear mixed models estimated the effects of television viewing time on quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants who watched ≥5 h of television per day had a 16% lower total quality of life score than did participants reporting ≤2 h per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deleterious associations of television viewing time were found with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> quality of life subscales: functional well-being showed the strongest association (23% difference in quality of life scores between highest and lowest television viewing categories), and social well-being the weakest association (6% difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants who increased their television viewing by one category (e.g., ≤2 h, increasing to 3-4 h per day) had a proportional decrease of some 6% in their quality of life score (intra-individual effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The deleterious associations of television viewing time with quality of life were clinically significant and consistent over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreasing sedentary behavior may be an important behavioral strategy to enhance the quality of life of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
