<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The combination of chemotherapy and bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor, is consistently being used as first- and second-line treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is little data of the activity of bevacizumab in chemorefractory mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective single center study was to evaluate the activity of bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in this study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six consecutive mCRC patients treated in the University Hospital Gasthuisberg (Leuven, Belgium) receiving bevacizumab in advanced lines following failure of conventional chemotherapy were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment regimen consisted of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg in combination with leucovorin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX) or leucovorin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy was used in third-line treatment in eight (17%) patients and in fourth-line treatment or more in 38 patients (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients previously failed irinotecan-based chemotherapy, 44 (96%) failed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based regimens, and 40 (87%) failed treatment with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab was given in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy in 36 patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in nine patients, and with single agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Objective response was demonstrated in ten patients (22%) and disease control in 38 (83%) with a median progression-free survival of 8.9 months and a median overall survival of 13.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only four patients experienced grade III and above bevacizumab-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taking into account the retrospective nature of the study which can influence the selection of patients, bevacizumab given in advanced lines after failure of conventional chemotherapy and antiepidermal growth factor receptor agents can result in high disease control rates in patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
