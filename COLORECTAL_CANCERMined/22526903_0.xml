<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2000 to 2010, 1,613 consecutive patients with CRLM were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological and outcome data were collected and analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (SLM), female, grade III-IV, T4 and N positive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, bilobar disease, number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> ≥ 4, size of largest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> ≥ 5 cm, serum CEA level ≥ 5 ng/ml, and CA19-9 level ≥ 37 u/ml were the predictors of adverse outcome using univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median survival and 5-year survival rate for patients after resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> was 49.8 months and 47%, better than that for those after other therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients without treatment had the poorest survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four initially unresectable patients underwent surgery after conversion therapy with a median survival of 36.9 months and a 5-year survival of 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, SLM, poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> ≥ 4, size of largest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> ≥ 5 cm, and no surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were found to be independent predictors of poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CRLM could get long-term survival benefit from different types of therapy, and resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> was the optimal strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A predictive model using these above five factors may be of use in stratifying patients who may benefit from intensive surveillance and adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
