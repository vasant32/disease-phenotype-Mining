<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients, caregivers, and health professionals alike are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potentially susceptible to responding with disgust and the associated avoidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This article aimed to review the early-stage literature related to disgust and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, consider the clinical implications, and suggest an appropriate research agenda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Given limited research in this area, a systematic review of the literature was broadened to include disgust and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEDLINE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases were searched, with additional works sourced by reviewing citation lists and/or by contacting the lead authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine studies were identified relating to disgust and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, and 6 related to disgust and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two broad findings emerged: (1) disgust appears to be promoting aversion to (and avoidance of) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, and (2) several known elicitors of disgust are widely apparent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Disgust likely represents a key emotional substrate for avoidance among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, caregivers, and health professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research is required to identify disgust's elicitors and effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> contexts, informing interventions that target early identification of persons at risk of maladaptive outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exposure therapies and mindfulness training may be well suited to treating disgust-generated avoidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Disgust has significant implications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> nurses are uniquely positioned to guide clinical interventions and ultimately improve outcomes in this area </plain></SENT>
