<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported outcome measures (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PROMs</z:e>) from trial participants indicate high acceptability and no adverse physical or psychological consequences, but this may not generalize to routine screening in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PROMs</z:e> in a community-based FS screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible adults aged 58-59 (n = 2016) registered at 34 London general practices were mailed a National Health Service-endorsed invitation to attend FS screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pain and side-effects were assessed in a 'morning-after' questionnaire, and satisfaction was assessed in a three-month follow-up questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo>, self-rated health and colorectal symptoms were assessed at prescreening and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1020 people attended screening and were included in the current analyses, of whom 913 (90%) returned the morning-after questionnaire, and 674 (66%) the follow-up questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prescreening questionnaire had been completed by 751 (74%) of those who attended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority (87%) of respondents reported no pain or mild pain, and the most frequent side-effect (wind) was only experienced more than mildly by 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction was extremely high, with 98% glad they had the test; 97% would encourage a friend to have it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From prescreening to follow-up there were no changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> or self-rated health, and the number of colorectal symptoms declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction and changes in wellbeing were not moderated by gender, deprivation, ethnicity or screening outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PROMs</z:e> indicate high acceptability of FS screening in 58-59 year olds, with no adverse effects on colorectal symptoms, health status or psychological wellbeing </plain></SENT>
