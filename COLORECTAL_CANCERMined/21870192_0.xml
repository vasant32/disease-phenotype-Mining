<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare two techniques for eliciting and clarifying patient values for decision making about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening: choice-based conjoint analysis and a rating and ranking task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using our decision lab registry and university e-mail lists, we recruited average risk adults ages 48-75 for a written, mailed survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible participants were given basic information about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and six attributes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests, then randomized to complete either a choice-based conjoint analysis with 16 discrete choice tasks or a rating and ranking task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was the most important attribute, as determined from conjoint analysis or participant ranking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conjoint analysis-based most important attribute was determined from individual patient-level utilities generated using multinomial logistic regression and hierarchical Bayesian modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 114 eligible participants, 104 completed and returned questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 57 (range 48-73), 70% were female, 88% were white, 71% were college graduates, and 62% were up to date with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ability to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality was the most frequent most important attribute for both the conjoint analysis (56% of respondents) and rating/ranking (76% of respondents) groups, and these proportions differed significantly between groups (absolute difference 20%, 95% CI 3%, 37%, p =0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups in proportion with clear values (p = 0.352), intent to be screened (p = 0.226) or unlabelled test preference (p = 0.521) CONCLUSIONS: Choice-based conjoint analysis produced somewhat different patterns of attribute importance than a rating and ranking task, but had little effect on other outcomes </plain></SENT>
