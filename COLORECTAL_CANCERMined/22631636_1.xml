<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that positive expression of MMP- 7 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues was significantly higher than that in distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (61.0% vs. 39.8%, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poor histological differentiation, advanced clinical stage and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were significantly correlated with MMP-7 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate was significantly higher in the MMP-7 negative group than the positive group (Log-rank test=9.957, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMP-7 appeared as a significant independent prognostic factor through multivariate survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, we found MMP-7 expression to be correlated with progression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and thus could be used as a predictive marker of prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
