<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic value of K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study included patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations was analyzed, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> positive for a K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutation were further analyzed to identify the mutation type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the following clinical and pathological variables were also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was composed of 53.3 % of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and 46.7 % of patients with mutated K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (mutated codon 12 was the most frequent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a mean follow-up of 15 months (range, 1-45), the median survival of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> was 31.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 24.8 months for patients with K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutated in codon 12 and 17.8 months for patients with mutated codon 13 (p = 0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> was associated with stage IV at diagnosis (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> was mutated, a lower overall survival was observed in cases of G → A transition compared with G → T transversion (19.5 vs. 24.2 months, respectively; p = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the amino acid change resulted in an acidic substitution, survival was lower, but it increased when the substitution resulted in a polar or nonpolar amino acid (19.5 vs. 23.2 vs. 24.4 months, p = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The type of K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutation or amino acid changes may have prognostic implications in metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
