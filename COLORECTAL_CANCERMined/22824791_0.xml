<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The key effector protein of the canonical Wnt pathway is β-catenin, which functions with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor to activate expression of Wnt target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a new functional screen based on cell survival in the presence of cDNAs encoding proteins that activate the Wnt pathway thus identifying novel Wnt signaling components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we identify carboxypeptidase E (|CPE) and its splice variant, ΔN-CPE, as novel regulators of the Wnt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that whereas ΔN-CPE activates the Wnt signal, the full-length CPE (F-CPE) protein is an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>F-CPE forms a complex with the Wnt3a ligand and the Frizzled receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, F-CPE disrupts disheveled-induced signalosomes that are important for transducing the Wnt signal and reduces β-catenin protein levels and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data indicate that F-CPE and ΔN-CPE regulate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway negatively and positively, respectively, and demonstrate that this screening approach can be a rapid means for isolation of novel Wnt signaling components.Oncogene advance online publication, 23 July 2012; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.308 </plain></SENT>
