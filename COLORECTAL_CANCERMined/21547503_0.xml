<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nothing helps patients and doctors to determine the risk of suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during their lives, except for medical tests such as the colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There have been several studies and research to try to estimate the relative risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> based on various factors and the applications to calculate the risk of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, but these are not within everyone's research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This project offers a multilingual Web tool, called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CRC">ColoRectal Cancer</z:e> Alert (CRCA), to calculate the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> for life in men and women of white race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this application, doctors can carry out research in a few minutes to explore this risk when they are seeing a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The platform is designed in such a way that anyone can use it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is easy to use and intuitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We should keep in mind that this tool does not replace diagnostic tests such as the colonoscopy or the sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is designed so that users with the assistance of their doctor know the risk and act accordingly (for example, having more checkups on the disease in case of high risk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To access the tool a computer with Internet connection will be required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Currently, 250 users of white race under the supervision of a specialist have completed the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
