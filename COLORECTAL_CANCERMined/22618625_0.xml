<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL/METHODICAL ISSUE: Fluorodeoxyglucose-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) has emerged as a very useful imaging modality in the management of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from the literature regarding the role of PET/CT in the initial diagnosis, staging, radiotherapy planning, response monitoring and surveillance of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Future directions and economic aspects are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and FDG-PET for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and endorectal ultrasound for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: Combined FDG-PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PERFORMANCE: While other imaging modalities allow superior visualization of the extent and invasion depth of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, PET/CT is most sensitive for the detection of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ACHIEVEMENTS: We recommend a targeted use of PET/CT in cases of unclear M staging, prior to metastasectomy and in suspected cases of residual or recurrent colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with equivocal conventional imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of PET/CT in radiotherapy planning and response monitoring needs to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently there is no evidence to support the routine use of PET/CT for colorectal screening, staging or surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: To optimally exploit the synergy between morphologic and functional information, FDG-PET should generally be performed as an integrated FDG-PET/CT with a contrast-enhanced CT component in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
