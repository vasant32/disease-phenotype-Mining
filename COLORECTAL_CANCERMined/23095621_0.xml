<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Retrospective data have shown that up to 80% of patients can successfully undergo a complete RM, whereas less than 30% of those undergoing classical management (CM) do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This registry-based study compared the 2 approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was based on the LiverMetSurvey (January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010) and included patients with 2 or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had irinotecan and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy before liver surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing simultaneous liver and colorectal surgery were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 787 patients were included: 729 in the CM group and 58 in the RM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the 2 groups had similar numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (4.20 vs 4.80 for RM and CM, P = 0.231) and Fong scores of 3 or more (79% vs 87%, P = 0.164) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal cancer</z:e>, neoadjuvant rectal radiotherapy, and the use of combined irinotecan/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> chemotherapy were more frequent in the RM group (P &lt; 0.001), whereas colorectal lymph node involvement was more frequent in the CM group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and disease-free survival were similar in the RM and CM groups (48% vs 46% at 5 years, P = 0.965 and 30% vs 26%, P = 0.992) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Classical and reversed managements of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are associated with similar survival when successfully completed </plain></SENT>
