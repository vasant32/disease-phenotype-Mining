<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the expressions of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> markers with respect to microsatellite instability (MSI) status in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunostainings for CD133, CD44, and CD166, and K-ras mutation analysis were performed on 50 MSI-high (MSI-H), and 50 microsatellite stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 11 MSS and MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, CD133 expression and DNA methylation statuses of the CD133 promoter were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD133 positive cells and the ability of colosphere formation were compared between HCT116 cells and HCT116 + Chr3 cells (hMLH1-restored HCT116 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> markers revealed that high CD133 expression was more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> than in MSI-H (P &lt; 0.001, 74.0% vs. 28.0%, respectively), and related with short disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither CD44 nor CD166 expression differed significantly with respect to MSI status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>K-ras mutation showed no association with expressions of CD133, CD44, or CD166 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD133 expression was relatively high in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> cell lines compared to those in MSI-H, and showed a reverse correlation with DNA methylation of the CD133 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>hMLH1-restored HCT116 cells increased proportions of CD133 positive cells and colosphere forming ability, compared to those in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high levels of CD133 expression were observed more frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than in MSI-H, suggesting that differential expression of colon <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> markers may be linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics dependent on MSI status. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
