<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Src family kinases are thought to be major signaling effectors of Netrin/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vertebrates, Src and the closely related Fyn kinases phosphorylate <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and form a receptor-bound signaling complex leading to activation of downstream effectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that, in the Drosophila embryonic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, Src kinases are dispensable for midline attraction of commissural axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this observation, tyrosine phosphorylation of the Netrin receptor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> or its Drosophila ortholog, Frazzled, is not necessary for attraction to Netrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we uncover an unexpected function of Src kinases: inhibition of midline axon crossing through a novel mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that distinct signaling outputs must exist for midline axon crossing independent of Src kinases in commissural neurons </plain></SENT>
