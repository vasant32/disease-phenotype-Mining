<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of IBD-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> however, differs markedly between cohorts from referral centers and population-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we aimed to identify characteristics potentially explaining these differences in two cohorts of patients with IBD-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PALGA, a nationwide pathology network and registry in The Netherlands, was used to search for patients with IBD-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between 1990 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients from 7 referral hospitals and 78 general hospitals were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic and disease specific parameters were collected retrospectively using patient charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 281 patients with IBD-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients from referral hospitals had a lower median age at IBD diagnosis (26 years vs. 28 years (p=0.02)), while having more IBD-relapses before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis than patients from general hospitals (3.8 vs. 1.5 (p&lt;0.01)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients from referral hospitals, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was diagnosed at a younger age (47 years vs. 51 years (p=0.01)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the median interval between IBD diagnosis and diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was similar in both cohorts (19 years in referral hospitals vs. 17 years in general hospitals (p=0.13)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IBD patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated in referral hospitals in The Netherlands are younger at both the diagnosis of IBD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than IBD patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated in general hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although patients from referral centers appeared to have a more severe course of IBD, the interval between IBD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis was similar </plain></SENT>
