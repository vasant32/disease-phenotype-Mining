<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the last few decades, a great deal of attention has been directed to the IGF system for its vital role in regulating cell and tissue survival, growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), a main constituent of this system, have been implicated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we intended to shed more light on two essential members; IGFBP3 as representative for the six main IGFBPs and IGFBP7 to represent their related proteins (IGFBP-rps) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our experiments on silencing IGFBP3 or IGFBP7 in the two human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines SW480, Caco2, and in the rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line CC531 show reduced proliferation, colony formation, and for IGFBP3, also reduced migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of both genes in 68 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples was higher in UICC stages II and III than in stages I and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, IGFBP3 was negatively correlated with age (p = 0.05) and positively related to IGFBP7 expression (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> experiment, the expression of both genes was drastically increased in response to early metastatic growth in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since these high levels returned gradually to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thereafter, it could be assumed that the up-regulation of IGFBPs is vital during the process of homing into the liver and early metastatic dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that IGFBP3 and 7 cannot be simply considered as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors but have additional properties, which become evident only during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
