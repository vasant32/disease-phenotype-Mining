<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, the promoter region of the APRIL gene was determined and the major transcription factor was investigated for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deletion analysis of 5'-ï¬‚anking region of the human APRIL gene and transient transfection revealed that a 538 bp region (from -1539 to -1001) was essential for promoter activation of the APRIL gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data from electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) indicated that the 538 bp promoter region was responsive to the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Sp1 or NF-kB increased the activity of the APRIL promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31856">Mithramycin</z:chebi> A (inhibitor of Sp1) and Bay11-7082 (inhibitor of NF-kB) exhibited an inhibitory activity to APRIL promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results will benefit to the APRIL gene regulation investigation and contribute to discover new drug target for the APRIL gene therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
