<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerns have been raised about financial incentives associated with the chemotherapy concession in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practices and their impact on treatment recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The objective of this study was to measure the physician-reported effects of prescribing chemotherapy or growth factors or making referrals to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specialists, hospice, or hospital admissions on medical oncologists' income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>US medical oncologists involved in the care of a population-based cohort of patients with lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) study were surveyed regarding their perceptions of the impact of prescribing practices or referrals on their income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although most oncologists reported that their incomes would be unaffected, compared with salaried oncologists, physicians in fee-for-service practice, and those paid a salary with productivity incentives were more likely to report that their income would increase from administering chemotherapy (odds ratios [ORs], 7.05 and 7.52, respectively; both P &lt; .001) or administering growth factors (ORs, 5.60 and 6.03, respectively; both P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of oncologists who are not paid a fixed salary report that their incomes increase when they administer chemotherapy and growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to understand the impact of these financial incentives on both the quality and cost of care </plain></SENT>
