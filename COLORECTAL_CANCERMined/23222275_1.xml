<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A multimodality approach for locally <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> in the pelvis provides a significant survival advantage when negative margins are achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, outcomes of surgical resection in patients who have locally re-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> in the pelvis are not well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the safety, feasibility of a negative margin resection, and survival outcomes in patients with pelvic locally re-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective review identified 406 patients who underwent surgery for locally <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1997 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had locally re-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> in the pelvis who underwent curative-intent resection were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (31 male) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age was 57 years (range, 30-84 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time to re-recurrence was 2.4 years (range, 0.5-5.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Margin status following re-resection was R0 60%, R1 32%, and R2 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nonbowel organs were resected en bloc in 81%, including 7 sacral resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative radiation was given to 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Morbidity occurred in 42%, with 6% requiring reoperation for complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was nil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 83% and 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival at 2 and 5 years was 55% and 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival for patients who had R0 and R1 resections was 37% and 42%, whereas no patients having an R2 resection survived beyond 2 years (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In highly selected patients with re-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> in the pelvis, we found that surgery could be performed safely and that a curative (R0) resection was possible in more than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Two- and 5-year survival rates are comparable to results seen when surgery is done for first-time recurrences </plain></SENT>
