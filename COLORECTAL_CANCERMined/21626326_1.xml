<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing surgery for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during a 16-year period (Group A [1992-2000, n = 258]; Group B [2001-2008, n = 258]) at Fukuoka City Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because no significant differences were found in the survival rates in stage 0, I, II, and III patients between the two groups, we concentrated on examining stage IV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3-year survival rate for stage IV patients in Group B (n = 26) was significantly higher than that in Group A (n = 31) (34.9% vs 3.9%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of curative resection for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in Group B patients was also significantly higher than that of Group A patients (50.0% vs 13.3%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, the 2-year survival rate for the disease-free patients in Group B was significantly higher than that for the non-disease-free patients in Group B (46.0% vs 21.0%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group B had a greater proportion of patients receiving l-leucovorin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> than Group A (8 patients vs none, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recent advances in surgical innovations and the utilization of new chemotherapeutic agents may have led to significant improvements in the treatment outcomes for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Japan </plain></SENT>
