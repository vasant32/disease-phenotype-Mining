<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysing the data without accounting for switching yields highly biased and inefficient estimates of the treatment effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we propose a novel class of semiparametric semicompeting risks transition survival models to accommodate treatment switches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Theoretical properties of the proposed model are examined and an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm is derived for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the model compared with the intent-to-treat analysis and other methods proposed in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed method is applied to data from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> clinical trial </plain></SENT>
