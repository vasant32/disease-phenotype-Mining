<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported the striking prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> in Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous epidemiological studies have reported an association between low dietary <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a case-control study design, we tested the association between plasma 25-hydroxy-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> (25-OHD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (2,001 cases, 2,237 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether plasma 25-OHD levels are causally linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, we applied the control function instrumental variable (IV) method of the mendelian randomization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) approach using four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2282679, rs12785878, rs10741657, rs6013897) previously shown to be associated with plasma 25-OHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low plasma 25-OHD levels were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the crude model (odds ratio (OR): 0.76, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.71, 0.81, p: 1.4Ã—10(-14)) and after adjusting for age, sex and other confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using an allele score that combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four SNPs as the IV, the estimated causal effect was OR 1.16 (95% CI 0.60, 2.23), whilst it was 0.94 (95% CI 0.46, 1.91) and 0.93 (0.53, 1.63) when using an upstream (rs12785878, rs10741657) and a downstream allele score (rs2282679, rs6013897), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>25-OHD levels were inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, in agreement with recent meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fact that this finding was not replicated when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> approach was employed might be due to weak instruments, giving low power to demonstrate an effect (&lt;0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> amongst individuals living in northerly latitudes is of considerable importance because of its relationship to disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the effect of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, additional large studies of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk are required and/or the application of alternative methods that are less sensitive to weak instrument restrictions </plain></SENT>
