<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This clinical audit assessed use of the proforma within the Thames Valley <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Network (TVCN) to see whether increased proforma use was associated with higher compliance to NICE guidelines and higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 2-week wait referrals for lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> to the six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> NHS Trusts in the TVCN received during the month of June 2010 were identified, anonymized and analysed in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 586 referrals audited, proforma usage varied significantly across the six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> NHS Trusts from 18% to 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Referral letters from primary care had NICE compliance ranging from 30 to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those which received a referral protocol, 50-90% were NICE compliant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proforma use was associated with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection rates (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results have wide-ranging implications since they suggest that the adoption of a simple proforma in primary care can improve the effectiveness of referral for suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
