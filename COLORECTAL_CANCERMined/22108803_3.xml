<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many of the transcriptional and growth regulating activities of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D(3)] in the intestine and colon are recapitulated in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell LS180 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore used this line together with chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq and gene expression analyses to identify the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> X receptor (RXR) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2/TCF4)/β-catenin cistromes and the genes that they regulate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VDR and RXR colocalized to predominantly promoter distal, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> response element-containing sites in a largely ligand-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These regulatory sites control the expression of both known as well as novel 1,25-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D(3) target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCF4 and β-catenin cistromes partially overlapped, contained TCF/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor consensus elements, and were only modestly influenced by 1,25-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the two heterodimer complexes colocalized at sites near a limited set of genes that included c-FOS and c-MYC; the expression of both genes was modulated by 1,25-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the c-FOS gene, both VDR/RXR and TCF4/β-catenin bound to a single distal enhancer located 24 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the c-MYC locus, however, binding was noted at a cluster of sites between -139 and -165 kb and at a site located -335 kb upstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examined as isolated enhancer fragments, these regions exhibited basal and 1,25-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D(3)-inducible activities that were interlinked to both VDR and β-catenin activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data reveal additional complexity in the regulation of target genes by 1,25-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D(3) and support a direct action of both VDR and the TCF4/β-catenin regulatory complex at c-FOS and c-MYC </plain></SENT>
