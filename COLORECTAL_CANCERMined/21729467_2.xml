<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is increasing interest in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> and its possible health effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present overview are to summarise the research on common diseases for which there is substantial evidence on <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, identify diseases where <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> may be beneficial and discuss the public health implications of these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Literature search of PubMed for the years 2000 to 2010 to identify cohort studies with baseline measures of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and randomised controlled trials (RCT) of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation in relation to fractures, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk ratios of disease from comparisons between 25(OH)D quantiles in these studies were summarised using RevMan software version 5·1 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community-based samples recruited into cohort studies from many countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Older men and women, mostly above 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When comparing the lowest 25(OH)D category with the highest (or reference), the pooled risk ratio (95 % CI) was: 1·34 (1·13, 1·59) for fractures from nine studies; 1·59 (1·30, 1·95) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from nine studies; 1·35 (1·17, 1·56) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> from twelve studies; and 1·42 (1·23, 1·63) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality from twelve studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cohort studies show that baseline 25(OH)D levels predict increased risk of fractures, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations are weak and could be explained by confounding variables such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of their potential public health significance, RCT using <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> doses ≥50 μg/d are required to determine whether <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> protects against these diseases </plain></SENT>
