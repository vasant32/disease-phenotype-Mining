<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36011">Pinosylvin</z:chebi> inhibited the proliferation of HCT 116 cells by arresting transition of cell cycle from G1 to S phase along with the downregulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A, cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4, c-Myc, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein (pRb), and the upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36011">Pinosylvin</z:chebi> was also found to attenuate the activation of proteins involved in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase (FAK)/c-Src/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/ <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36011">pinosylvin</z:chebi> suppressed the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, one of downstream molecules of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling, and these events led to the sequential downregulation of β-catenin-mediated transcription of target genes including BMP4, ID2, survivin, cyclin D1, MMP7, and c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that the anti-proliferative activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36011">pinosylvin</z:chebi> might be associated with the cell cycle arrest and downregulation of cell proliferation regulating signaling pathways in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
