<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We explored the prognostic value of actual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> measurements (TM) versus World Health Organization (WHO) criteria as three-level (responder, stable, and progression) and two-level (responder and non-responder) variables at 12 and 24 weeks as predictors of survival in Intergroup Trial N9741, a phase III trial in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513041" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measurable disease</z:e> (N = 1,188) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage changes in TM from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognostic values of TM versus WHO criteria (as three- and two-level variables) at 12 and 24 weeks were compared, using Cox models for overall survival (OS) in a landmark analysis, adjusting for baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, performance status, and treatment arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> status at 12 weeks by WHO criteria (three or two levels) or actual TM were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strongly associated with OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actual TM provided no meaningful additional benefit compared with the three-level WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> status at 24 weeks was also strongly associated with survival, but added no additional prognostic value compared with the 12-week assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 12 weeks, actual TM improved prognostic characterization of patients with WHO status of response, but provided no additional value in patients with stable disease or progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In N9741, the use of actual TM, or following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status beyond 12 weeks, did not improve survival prediction compared with a single three-level response assessment at 12 weeks, suggesting that 12-week <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status could be an appropriate phase II trial endpoint in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
