<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent to which consumers understand typical results provided by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> genetic testing is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Misunderstanding of the results could lead to negative consequences including unnecessary concern, false reassurance or unwarranted changes in screening behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study to investigate consumers' perceptions and understanding of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An online survey was posted on Facebook that included questions relating to 4 sample test results for risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic counselors were used as a comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 145 individuals from the general public and 171 genetic counselors completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was found between the way the general public and genetic counselors interpreted the meaning of the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The general public respondents also believed that results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 scenarios would be significantly more helpful than the genetic counselors did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of general public respondents rated the results as easy to understand, they often misinterpreted them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply that the general public has the potential to misinterpret <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> results without appropriate assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to explore optimal methods of providing <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> test results and ways to minimize the risk of negative consequences for consumers </plain></SENT>
