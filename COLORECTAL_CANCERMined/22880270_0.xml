<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic dehiscence has a significant impact on the whole p postoperative disease course, may influence the overal survival (OS) and disease free interval (DFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to analyze clinical and histopathological factors, that could facilitate detection of dehiscences and are related to the prognosis of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors performed statistical analysis of a cohort of patients (340 pacients, 207 males, 133 females) who underwent radical resection followed by anastomosis on the large intestine during 2003-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following factors were assessed: age, gender, staging, protective stoma, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy and anastomotic insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications were evaluated according to Clavien and Dindo classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis confirmed the following factors to be statistically significant for prognosis of OS and DFI: In stage T4 subjects, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 2.5 x higher and the risk of recurrence was 1.9 x higher than in the lower disease stage subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of N2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 3.7 x and the risk of recurrence 3.6 x, compared to N0 and N1 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of postoperative complications classified asf III.-V. grade according to Clavien and Dindo classification increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 4x </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 5.5 x higher in patients with dehiscence of anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The surprising finding was that even protective stoma increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 5.4 x </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy were at 2 x higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with IIIA, IIIB, IV, V complications, the following factors proved to be statistically significant for prognosis of OS: leakage, protective stoma, adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant oncological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with complications I and II, the following factors were proved to be statistically significant for prognosis of OS: staging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph nodes metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis CART confirmed significant correlation between the lymph nodes positivity and the Clavien and Dindo classification of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Analysis of clinical and histopathological factors is important for prediction of prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after radical surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Detection and application of these prognostic factors in postoperative period could influence the strategy of treatment and thus the overal survival in patients with radical resections for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nonadministration of adjutant chemotherapy results in a significant decrease in OS and DFI </plain></SENT>
