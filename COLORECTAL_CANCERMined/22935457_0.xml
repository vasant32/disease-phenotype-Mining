<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: in the period 2009-2012 160 patients were operated on because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="CRC">large bowel cancer</z:e>, 79 women and 81 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Average age of patients was 66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conversion was recognized as desuflation of peritoneal cavity, trocars removal and making laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The conversion was made in 22 cases (13,7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More in men (16.1%) than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conversion was made twice as likely in T3 and T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than in T1 and T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of conversion in laparoscopic operations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
