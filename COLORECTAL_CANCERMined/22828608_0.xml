<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor β (ERβ) is the predominantly expressed ER in the colon and loss of ERβ in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Information on vital status by the end of 2009 was obtained for 1262 CRC patients recruited between 2003 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ERβ expression was immunohistochemically measured and associations of ERβ scores with overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for prognostic factors, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage and second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1101 tumour samples with successful measurement, 535 were ERβ negative (48.6%), 381 (34.6%) showed moderate and 185 (16.8%) showed high ERβ expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with high ERβ expression, lack of ERβ was associated with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stages as well as greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, ERβ negativity was associated with an increased hazard ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR=1.61, 95% CI 1.09-2.40, P=0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (HR=1.54, 95% CI 0.99-2.39, P=0.06) as well as a poorer DFS (DFS HR=1.64, 95% CI 1.23-3.36, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The associations were stronger in stage I-III patients (OS HR=2.20, 95% CI 1.28-4.06, P=0.007, DSS HR=2.38, 95% CI 1.20-5.39, P=0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lack of ERβ expression is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> stages and independently associated with poor survival </plain></SENT>
