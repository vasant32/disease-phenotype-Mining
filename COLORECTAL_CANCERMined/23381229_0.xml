<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Altered expression of collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) has been reported in several <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>, including downregulation of CRMP1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and upregulation of CRMP2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the relationship between CRMP expression and clinicopathological characteristics in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breast tissues were used to assess CRMP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average expression level of each CRMP (CRMP1-5) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was analyzed in a subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> specimens and compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breast tissue by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 173 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> specimens and matching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breast controls were used for immunohistochemistry based on the tissue microarray technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of CRMP2 and phosphorylated CRMP2 protein were assessed, and possible correlations between the clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of CRMP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> tissues, while that of the other CRMPs was similar between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed that CRMP2 protein expression was also decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> tissues (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated CRMP2 was observed in the nuclei of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mammary cells (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, nuclear phosphorylated CRMP2 expression was increased in proportion to the histological grade and triple-negative subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced CRMP2 expression and elevated expression of nuclear phosphorylated CRMP2 may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
