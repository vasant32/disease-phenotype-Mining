<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study compared the short-term surgical outcomes of the vertical transumbilical incision with the left lower transverse incision for specimen retrieval in laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred forty-seven consecutive patients scheduled for laparoscopic surgery for sigmoid colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> between April 2010 and December 2010 were classified into one of the two groups according to the site of the minilaparotomy: a transumbilical incision group (n = 92) and a left lower transverse incision group (n = 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Demographic data, operation time, estimated blood loss, frequency of transfusion, size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, number of harvested lymph nodes, distal resection margins, time to first flatus, and length of hospital stay were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative pain scores were also similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The length of the minilaparotomy incision was shorter in the transumbilical group than the left lower transverse group at operation (mean, 4.6 vs. 6.2 cm, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative mean satisfaction score was higher in the transumbilical group, but this was not statistically significant (7.6 vs. 7.1, p = 0.224) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients in the transumbilical group and 7 patients in the left lower transverse group developed wound-related complications (p = 0.810), including two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo>, both in the transumbilical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High body mass index (≥25 kg/m(2)) and longer operative time (≥180 min) were risk factors for wound complications on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transumbilical minilaparotomy in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is a good alternative approach with acceptable wound complications </plain></SENT>
