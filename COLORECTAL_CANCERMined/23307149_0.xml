We compared the accuracies of endocytoscopy and standard biopsy for the diagnosis of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a randomized, controlled, open-label trial of patients with colorectal lesions (â‰¥ 5 mm) detected during colonoscopy in a tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We randomly assigned the 203 detected lesions of 170 eligible patients to either the endocytoscopy or standard biopsy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An on-site endoscopist assessed the histopathology of the endocytoscopy group lesions according to the endocytoscopic findings, whereas a pathologist later assessed standard biopsy group lesions by microscopic examination of the biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated the diagnostic accuracies in both groups with reference to the final histopathology of the resected specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was to determine whether the diagnostic accuracy of endocytoscopy for neoplastic lesions was noninferior to that of standard biopsy (with a predefined noninferiority margin of 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were by intention-to-treat and per-protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study is registered, number UMIN000003923 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 102 lesions in the endocytoscopy group and 101 in the standard biopsy group were available for primary outcome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy of endocytoscopy for the discrimination of neoplastic lesions was 94.1% (95% confidence interval 87.6% to 97.8%), whereas that of standard biopsy was 96.0% (90.2% to 98.9%), which is within the noninferiority margin (absolute difference -1.9%, -8.6% to +5.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endocytoscopy is noninferior to standard biopsy for the discrimination of neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With its advantage of providing an on-site diagnosis, endocytoscopy could provide a novel alternative to standard biopsy in routine colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
