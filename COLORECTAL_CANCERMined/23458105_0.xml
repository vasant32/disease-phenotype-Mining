<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The achievement of negative (R0) margins is a major determinant of disease-free survival in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current imaging techniques are of limited value in achieving this goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new approach to the intraoperative detection of colorectal liver metastatic tissue based on the emission of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) fluorescence was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 25 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> who were eligible for liver resection received a bolus of ICG (0.5 mg/kg body weight) 24 h before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During surgery, ICG fluorescence, which accumulates around lesions as a result of defective biliary clearance, was detected with a near-infrared camera system, the Photodynamic Eye (PDE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Numbers of lesions detected by, respectively, PDE + ICG, intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) and preoperative computed tomography (CT) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The near-infrared camera plus ICG revealed a total of 77 metastatic liver nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative CT demonstrated 45 (58.4%) and IOUS showed 55 (71.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperative CT and IOUS alone were inferior to the combined use of PDE + ICG and IOUS in the detection of lesions of ≤3 mm in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This experience suggests that PDE + ICG, combined with IOUS, may represent a safe and effective tool for ensuring the complete surgical eradication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
