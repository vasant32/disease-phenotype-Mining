<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that overexpression of PODXL is an independent factor of poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to validate these results in two additional independent patient cohorts and to examine the correlation between PODXL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: PODXL protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples from a consecutive, retrospective cohort of 270 CRC patients (cohort 1) and a prospective cohort of 337 CRC patients (cohort 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of PODXL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was measured by real-time quantitative PCR in a subgroup of 62 patients from cohort 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spearman's Rho and Chi-Square tests were used for analysis of correlations between PODXL expression and clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were applied to assess the relationship between PODXL expression and time to recurrence (TTR), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High PODXL protein expression was significantly associated with unfavourable clinicopathological characteristics in both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cohort 1, high PODXL expression was associated with a significantly shorter 5-year OS in both univariable (HR = 2.28; 95% CI 1.43-3.63, p = 0.001) and multivariable analysis (HR = 2.07; 95% CI 1.25-3.43, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cohort 2, high PODXL expression was associated with a shorter TTR (HR = 2.93; 95% CI 1.26-6.82, p = 0.013) and DFS (HR = 2.44; 95% CI 1.32-4.54, p = 0.005), remaining significant in multivariable analysis, HR = 2.50; 95% CI 1.05-5.96, p = 0.038 for TTR and HR = 2.11; 95% CI 1.13-3.94, p = 0.019 for DFS.No significant correlation could be found between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and protein expression of PODXL and there was no association between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and clinicopathological parameters or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Here, we have validated the previously demonstrated association between immunohistochemical expression of PODXL and poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in two additional independent patient cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results further underline the potential utility of PODXL as a biomarker for more precise prognostication and treatment stratification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
