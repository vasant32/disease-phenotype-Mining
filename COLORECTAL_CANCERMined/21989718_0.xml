<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A combination of two drugs may restrain precancerous <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colon polyps</z:mp>, opening a new possible opportunity for chemoprevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this context, chemopreventive efficacy of a combination regimen of C-phycocyanin, a biliprotein present in Spirulina platensis, a cyanobacterium, which is a selective cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi>, a traditional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> was considered in 1,2 dimethylhyadrazine (DMH)-induced colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, DNA fragmentation, fluorescent staining, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) enzyme immunoassay, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3435">carrageenan</z:chebi>-induced paw <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> test were performed along with morphological and histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DMH treatment showed a rich presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_481'>preneoplastic lesions</z:mpath> such as multiple plaque lesions, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath>, and well-characterized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These features were reduced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> and C-phycocyanin administration </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DMH treatment revealed intact high molecular weight genomic DNA with no signs of laddering/DNA fragmentation while it was noticeable significantly in control and DMH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> + C-phycocyanin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DMH group showed highest COX-2 expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) level in comparison with other groups </plain></SENT>
