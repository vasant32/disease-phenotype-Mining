<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, some of these patients benefit from treatment with cetuximab, especially patients with a mutation at codon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted an analysis to study the influence of the KRAS p.G13D mutation in patients with mCRC who were treated with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the KRAS mutation status of 110 patients who were treated with cetuximab between September 2003 and October 2008 at Hospital Cl√≠nico, San Carlos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate according to KRAS mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with mutations at codon 13 compared with those with other KRAS mutations showed no statistically significant differences in progression-free survival (4.96 months [95% CI, 3.04-6.89 months] vs. 3.10 months [95% CI, 1.58-4.61 months]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.88 [95% CI, 44-1.75]; P = .72) and overall survival (8.2 months [95% CI, 4.2-12.1 months] vs. 14.6 months [95% CI, 8.0-21.2 months]; HR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.23-1.09]; P = .084) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have a longer progression-free survival (7.30 months [95% CI, 4.48-10.12 months]; HR 0.46 [95% CI, 0.23-0.91]; P = .025) and overall survival (19.0 months [95% CI, 10.2-27.8 months]; HR 0.32 [95% CI, 0.15-0.69]; P = .004) than patients with p.G13D-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in the response rate were not observed between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with mCRC and mutation at codon 13 of the KRAS gene do not appear to benefit from treatment with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support the current clinical practice </plain></SENT>
