<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aimed to determine the origin of bone marrow -<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTCs</z:chebi> using human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells in in vivo and in vitro experimental settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: CD1 <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> female mice were xenotransplanted with SW620 cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line isolated from a male patient) injected in the colon wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, the presence of SW620 in the bone marrow (BM), colon and other organs/tissues was recognized by detection of the epithelial marker cytokeratin-19 (CK19) and Y-chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition SW620 cells or their conditioned media were cultured with human BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macroscopically evident CK19+/Y-chromosome+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> developed only in five mice receiving SW620 cells while putative <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTCs</z:chebi> (CK19+) were found in the bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of these CK19+ cells were Y-chromosome-negative, only few being Y-chromosome-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro SW620 cells or their conditioned medium induced CK19 expression in cultured human bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> can induce the appearance of two distinct CK19+ cell populations in the bone marrow, one of metastatic origin and the other of murine origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that bone marrow cells may undergo phenotypic modifications induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells. © 2013 The Authors </plain></SENT>
