<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Together with the variety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> molecular antitumor effects this has prompted the development of novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> derivatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to test five novel derivatives (compounds 2-14, 2-17, 2-28, 2-34L, 2-39) for their effect on cell proliferation, their capability to scavenge <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anions</z:chebi>, to induce a cell cycle arrest and to improve replication fidelity in cultured colorectal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compound 2-14 was identified as the strongest inhibitor of cell proliferation and functioned as a potent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenger, as did 2-17 and 2-34L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2-14 induced a G2/M-arrest in HCT116 and a G0/G1-arrest in HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2-17 caused a G0/G1-arrest and 2-34L a G2/M-arrest in HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2-17 and 2-34L reduced mutation rates at a (CA)13 repeat in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that certain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> derivatives share important antitumor effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From this experimental profile compounds 2-17 and 2-34L both improve replication fidelity, which is biologically relevant not only for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> but also potentially for individuals with hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
