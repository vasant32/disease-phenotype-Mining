<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present meta-analysis of literatures was performed to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case-control studies of Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn polymorphisms on the susceptibility of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (colon, rectum, and colon/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 22 eligible studies were selected for this meta-analysis, including 3,042 cases and 4,627 controls for Lys751Gln and 1,581 cases and 2,846 controls for Asp312Asn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, no significantly elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (for Lys751Gln polymorphism: Lys/Gln vs. Lys/Lys, OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.90-1.14; Gln/Gln vs. Lys/Lys, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.85-1.26; dominant model, OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.93-1.15; recessive model, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.87-1.25; and for Asp312Asn polymorphism: Asp/Asn vs. Asp/Asp, OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.91-1.35; Asn/Asn vs. Asp/Asp, OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.87-1.47; dominant model, OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.94-1.26; recessive model, OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.88-1.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>And for the additive model, individuals carrying the 751Gln or 312Asn allele were not significantly associated with increased risk to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.94-1.11, OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.95-1.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn polymorphisms may not be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
