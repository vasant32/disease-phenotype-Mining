<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of UHRF2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed real-time quantitative PCR on 32 pathologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> samples (grade I, 4 cases; grade II, 11 cases; grade III, 10 cases; and grade IV, 7 cases; according to the 2007 WHO classification system) and four <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cell lines (A172, U251, U373, and U87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of UHRF2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly lower in the grade III and grade IV groups compared with the noncancerous brain tissue group, whereas its expression was high in A172, U251, and U373 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An in vitro assay was performed to investigate the functions of UHRF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a lentivirus-based <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference (RNAi) approach, we down-regulated UHRF2 expression in the U251 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This down- regulation led to the inhibition of cell proliferation, an increase in cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and a change of cell cycle distribution, in which S stage cells decreased and G2/M stage cells increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that UHRF2 may be closely related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
