<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this article are to investigate the serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> (LOOH) levels and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and arylesterase (ARE) activity in patients with lung, breast, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum PON1 and ARE activities and LOOH levels were measured in 110 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and same number of age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum LOOH levels were found to be increased while serum PON1 and ARE activities were found to be decreased in patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PON1 activity was found to be lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> than in patients with lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were positive correlations between the serum PON1 and ARE activities in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We concluded that decreased PON1 and ARE activities and increased LOOH levels might have a connection to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PON1 activity is decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but it does not seem to be related to metastase status except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
