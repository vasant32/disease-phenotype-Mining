<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chemopreventive agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> has anti-proliferative effects in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types, but characterization of cell cycle arrest, particularly with physiologically relevant concentrations, is still incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following oral ingestion, the highest concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> are achievable in the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it has been established that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> induces arrest at the G(2)/M stage of the cell cycle in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> lines, it is not clear whether arrest occurs at the G(2)/M transition or in mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the precise stage of arrest, we performed a direct comparison of the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-induced G(2)/M boundary and mitotic arrest in eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> lines (Caco-2, DLD-1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>-7, HCT116p53+/+, HCT116p53(-)/(-), HCT116p21(-)/(-), HT-29 and SW480) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry confirmed that these lines underwent G(2)/M arrest following treatment for 12h with clinically relevant concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (5-10 Î¼M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight lines, the majority of this arrest occurred at the G(2)/M transition, with a proportion of cells arresting in mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examination of the mitotic index using fluorescence microscopy showed that the HCT116 and Caco-2 lines exhibited the highest levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-induced mitotic arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Image analysis revealed impaired mitotic progression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines, exemplified by mitotic spindle abnormalities and defects in chromosomal congression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with inhibitors of the DNA damage signalling pathway abrogated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-induced mitotic arrest, but had little effect at the G(2)/M boundary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pH2A.X staining seen in mitotic, but not interphase, cells suggests that this aberrant mitosis results in DNA damage </plain></SENT>
