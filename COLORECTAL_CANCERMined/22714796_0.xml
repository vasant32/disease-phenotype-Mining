<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Mannheim <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>Peritonitis</z:hpo> Index (MPI) was used to determine the preoperative status and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for postoperative status, retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 25 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-related colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were classified as having a preoperative MPI ≤ 29 or ≥ 30 and the mean postoperative SOFA scores were 2.30 ± 2.45 and 7.93 ± 3.45 (p = 0.0002), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of 20 patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection received a bowel anastomosis without a stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MPI of these seven patients was low (23.1 ± 7.47) and there were no severe postoperative organ disorders (SOFA score 1.86 ± 2.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 25 patients had no distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of these 18 patients underwent lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) dissection, including intermediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e>, while the other 10 cases only had the pericolic/perirectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average preoperative MPI was 23.9 ± 7.68 and 32.8 ± 5.77, and the postoperative SOFA scores were 3.75 ± 3.01 and 7.10 ± 5.34, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The MPI could be used to predict postoperative organ disorders and thus represents a useful index that can be used to determine the optimal surgical methods </plain></SENT>
