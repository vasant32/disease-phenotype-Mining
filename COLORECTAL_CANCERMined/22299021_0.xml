<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> is an important process in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the angiogeneic balance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) by evaluating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) on colonic epithelial cells, together with the expression of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 11 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, and 11 healthy controls colonic biopsy samples were evaluated immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expressions of TSP-1, VEGF, and iNOS in UC and CD groups were higher than expression in healthy control group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> group, VEGF and iNOS expressions were increased importantly, but TSP-1 expression was not statistically different from healthy control group's expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both TSP-1 and VEGF expressions were correlated with iNOS expression distinctly but did not correlate with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both pro-angiogeneic VEGF and antiangiogeneic TSP-1 expressions were found increased in our IBD groups, but in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> group, only VEGF expression was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TSP-1 increases in IBD patients as a response to inflammatory condition, but this increase was not enough to suppress <z:mp ids='MP_0003711'>pathologic angiogenesis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in IBD </plain></SENT>
