<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Microtubule-associated doublecortin and CaM kinase-like-1 (DCLK1) is a novel candidate marker for intestinal stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess DCLK1 immunoreactivity in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and its correlation with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DCLK1 immunostaining was performed in colorectal tissue from 71 patients, including 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath>, 40 primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and 14 metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each case was evaluated by a combined scoring method based on the intensity of staining (score 0-3) and the percentage of tissue staining positive (score 0-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoexpression for DCLK1 was considered as positive when the combined score was 2-6 and negative with a score of 0-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 14/18 (78%) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 30/40 (75%) of primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and 7/14 (50%) of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were positive for DCLK1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> there was no association between DCLK1 staining score and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, after curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection, patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had a high (â‰¥5) combined staining score had increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific mortality compared to patients with low (0-4) staining score (hazard ratio 5.89; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-28.47; P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that DCLK1 is frequently expressed in colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and may be associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to validate the use of DCLK1 as a prognostic marker </plain></SENT>
