<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The analytical algorithm of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> (LS) is increasingly complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BRAF V600E mutation and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation have been proposed as a screening tool for the identification of LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the clinical usefulness and cost-effectiveness of both somatic alterations to improve the yield of the diagnostic algorithm of LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 122 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from individuals with family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> that showed microsatellite instability and/or loss of mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMR germline mutations were detected in 57 cases (40 MLH1, 15 MSH2 and 2 MSH6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BRAF V600E mutation was assessed by single-nucleotide primer extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MLH1 promoter hypermethylation was assessed by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in a subset of 71 cases with loss of MLH1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A decision model was developed to estimate the incremental costs of alternative case-finding methods for detecting MLH1 mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess robustness of estimations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of the absence of BRAF mutations for depiction of LS patients was 96% (23/24) and specificity was 28% (13/47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specificity of MLH1 promoter hypermethylation for depiction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was 66% (31/47) and sensitivity of 96% (23/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cost per additional mutation detected when using hypermethylation analysis was lower when compared with BRAF study and germinal MLH1 mutation study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Somatic hypermethylation of MLH1 is an accurate and cost-effective pre-screening method in the selection of patients that are candidates for MLH1 germline analysis when LS is suspected and MLH1 protein expression is absent </plain></SENT>
