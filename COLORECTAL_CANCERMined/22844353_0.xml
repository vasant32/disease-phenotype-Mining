<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that IL-23 is able to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and a recent study revealed that IL-23R is expressed in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, neither the differences in the IL-23R expression among the patients nor the concrete functions of IL-23 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells have been revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the characteristics of IL-23R expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and the direct effects of IL-23 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the IL-23R expression in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue samples by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation and invasion assays under IL-23 stimulation were performed using cultured cells derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ELISA and real-time PCR were used to evaluate the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β production due to IL-23 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the TNM stage IV patients were positive for IL-23R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-23R expression in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissue was also relatively high at the deepest point of invasion in certain cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proliferative and invasive activities and/or TGF-β production of DLD-1 cells increased by IL-23 stimulation, whereas no change was observed in the activities of MIP101 and KM12c cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IL-23 directly enhanced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of the colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An autocrine mechanism via TGF-β production may underlie these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IL-23 is therefore a potential target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the homogeneity in IL-23R expression and the effects of IL-23 on colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells should be considered </plain></SENT>
