<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of a program to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) among uninsured Latinas receiving mammography through a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening clinic in northern Manhattan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between August 2009 and March 2010, unscreened, average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, uninsured Latinas, aged 50-64 years, undergoing mammography received a screening recommendation, education, and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Socio-demographic information and level of acculturation was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening compliance was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 651 Latinas evaluated, 210 were eligible and, of these, 94% (n=197) consented to participate; 441 were excluded because they were up-to-date with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (n=130), &lt; 50 (n=285) or &gt;64 (n=26) years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After intervention, 177 (90%) completed FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within 2 weeks, 87% completed the FIT, and 69% did so with no reminder calls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Acculturation was significantly lower among screeners (p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-screeners, screeners were more likely to be foreign-born (p=0.009), to speak only Spanish (p=0.043), and to prefer to read (p=0.037), and think (p=0.015) in Spanish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that pairing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> education and screening with mammography is both feasible and efficacious </plain></SENT>
