<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Advances in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) in the last decade have significantly improved survival; however, simple biomarkers to predict response or toxicity have not been identified, which are applicable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> community <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> settings worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of inflammatory markers based on differential white-cell counts, such as the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), may be simple and readily available biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical information and baseline laboratory parameters were available for 349 patients, from two independent cohorts, with unresectable mCRC receiving first-line palliative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations between baseline prognostic variables, including inflammatory markers such as the NLR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response, progression and survival were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the training cohort, combination-agent chemotherapy (P=0.001) and NLR ≤ 5 (P=0.003) were associated with improved clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ECOG performance status 1 (P=0.002), NLR&gt;5 (P=0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminaemia</z:hpo> (P=0.03) and single-agent chemotherapy (P&lt;0.0001) were associated with increased risk of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ECOG performance status ≥ 1 (P=0.004) and NLR&gt;5 (P=0.002) predicted worse overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NLR was confirmed to independently predict OS in the validation cohort (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Normalisation of the NLR after one cycle of chemotherapy in a subset of patients resulted in improved progression-free survival (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results have highlighted NLR as a potentially useful clinical biomarker of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in predicting clinically meaningful outcomes in two independent cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results of this study have also confirmed the importance of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> influencing clinical outcomes in patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
