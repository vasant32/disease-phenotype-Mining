<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients undergoing IORT for locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> from 2001-2009 were reviewed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e>, survival, and procedure-related morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cumulative event rates were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with locally advanced (n = 8) or recurrent (n = 21) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> were treated with IORT and resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical interventions included low anterior resection, abdominoperineal resection, pelvic exenteration, and a variety of non-anatomic resections of pelvic recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>R(0) resections were achieved in 16 patients, while R(1) resections were achieved in 10, and margins were grossly positive in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IORT was delivered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients over a median area of 48 (42-72) cm(2) at a median dose of 12 (12-15) Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local and overall recurrence rates were 24 % (locally advanced group) and 45 % (recurrent group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median disease-free and overall survival were 25 and 40 months respectively at a median follow-up of 26 (18-42) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The short-term (≤30 days) complication rate was 45 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight patients developed local wound complications, 5 of which required operative intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243001" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intra-abdominal abscesses</z:e> requiring drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term (&gt;30��days) complications were identified in 11 patients (38 %) and included long-term wound complications (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006000'>ureteral obstruction</z:hpo> requiring stenting (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000011'>neurogenic bladder</z:hpo> (n = 3), enteric fistulae (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small bowel obstruction</z:e> (n = 1), and neuropathic pain (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative brachytherapy is a viable IORT option during pelvic surgery for locally advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> but is associated with high postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whether intraoperative brachytherapy can improve local recurrence rates for locally advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> will require further prospective investigation </plain></SENT>
