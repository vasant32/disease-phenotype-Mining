<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An increased mortality has been reported in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), while figures have remained similar or decreased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) compared to the population in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the long-term mortality risk of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) in a well-defined population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data were based on a prospective IBD register in our catchment area; follow-up covered 1986-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The population based cohort comprised 1915 adult patients, 1254 with UC, 550 with CD, and 111 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> unclassified (IBDU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were obtained from Statistics Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recorded 223 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among the 1915 patients with IBD within a follow-up of 29,644 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The standardised mortality rate (SMR) was 1.14 in CD and 0.90 in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cause-specific mortality; the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases of the digestive system</z:e> was significantly increased in CD (SMR 5.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was non-significantly increased in both UC and CD (SMR 1.80 and 1.88, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to the background population, there were significantly fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349096" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol</z:e> (0 observed, 10.2 expected in IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall mortality in CD and CU was not different from that in the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In cause-specific mortality, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases of the digestive system</z:e> were significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0556006" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental and behavioural disorders</z:e> resulting from alcohol consumption were less common in patients with IBD than in the population at large in Finland </plain></SENT>
