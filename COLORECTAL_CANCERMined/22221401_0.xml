<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fewer positive margins and intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> have been reported compared with standard APE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to compare short-term complications and results of the two techniques in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> undergoing APE between 2004 and 2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were divided into two groups of 79 patients in extralevator APE and 79 in standard APE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrence and those having a palliative procedure were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from hospital records and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Main endpoints were wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, perineal wound revision, oncological data and length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circumferential resection margin positivity did not differ significantly between groups (17% extralevator APE; 20% standard APE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (13%vs 10%) or local recurrence (seven in each group) were no different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perineal wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was more common after extralevator APE (46%vs 28%, P&lt;0.05) as was perineal wound revision (22%vs 8%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital stay was longer after extralevator APE (median 12 vs 11days, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> height (median 4cm) and pTNM classification did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results do not show any advantage for extralevator APE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The oncological data were no better and postoperative morbidity was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed before extralevator APE is widely adopted in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
