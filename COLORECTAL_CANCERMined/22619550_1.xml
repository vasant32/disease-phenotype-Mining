<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ear tumors</z:e> were employed to investigate the therapeutic effects of US, MBs, and pegylated liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (PLD) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> started to receive treatments when they grew up to about 15 mm(3) (early stage) with injection of PLD 10 mg/kg, or up to 50 mm(3) (medium stage) with PLD 6 (or 4) mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments included the control, PLD alone, PLD + MBs + US, US alone, and MBs + US groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure for the PLD + MBs + US group was that PLD was injected first, MB (SonoVue) injection followed, and then US was immediately sonicated on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that: (1) US sonication with MBs was always able to produce a further hindrance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> for both early and medium-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; (2) for the medium-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 6 mg/kg PLD alone was able to inhibit their growth, while it did not work for 4 mg/kg PLD alone; (3) with the application of MBs + US, 4 mg/kg PLD was able to inhibit the growth of medium-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; (4) for early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> after the first treatment with a high dose of PLD alone (10 mg/kg), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size still increased for several days and then decreased (a biphasic pattern); (5) MBs + US alone was able to hinder the growth of early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but unable to hinder that of medium stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of histological examinations and blood perfusion measurements indicated that the application of MBs + US disrupts the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> blood vessels and enhances the delivery of PLD into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> to significantly inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
