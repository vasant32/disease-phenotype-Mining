<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Helical tomotherapy (HT), such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or stereotactic body radiotherapy therapy, is a recent radiation therapy technique which can provide simultaneous and precise targeting of multiple lesions, while sparing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
