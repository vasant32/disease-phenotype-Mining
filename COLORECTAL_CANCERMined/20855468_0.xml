<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous phase I trials of NGR-hTNF indicated 0.8 and 45 μg/m(2) as optimal biological and maximum-tolerated dose, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two sequential cohorts of 12 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients who had failed standard therapies received NGR-hTNF 0.8 or 45 μg/m(2) in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median number of prior treatment lines was 3 in the low-dose and 2 in the high-dose cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 21 patients had been pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No grade 3-4 NGR-hTNF-related toxicities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 1-2 chills were reported in 43% and 40% of cycles in the low-dose and high-dose cohorts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the low-dose cohort, one patient achieved a partial response and five had stable disease for a median of 4.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the high-dose cohort, six patients had stable disease for a median of 3.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 50% and 33% in the low-dose and high-dose cohort, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients in low-dose cohort experienced PFS longer than PFS on last prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both NGR-hTNF doses were safely combined with XELOX in pretreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hint of activity was apparent only with low-dose NGR-hTNF </plain></SENT>
