<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction: There is now accumulating evidence to suggest that intratumoral adaptive immune responses predict patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes has been correlated with patients' disease-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent exciting studies of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) have underlined the significance of including immunological biomarkers as prognostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas covered: This review covers recent literature which suggests that the type, density and location of immune cells within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> represent a better predictor of patient survival than the histopathological methods currently used to stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expert opinion: Remarkably, the quantity, quality and spatial distribution of immune cells within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> has a greater prognostic value than the standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden, infiltration of draining and regional lymph nodes by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, and evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, such an immune classification may also have a predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, by increasing the knowledge of the immune events inside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and by better understanding the immune architecture of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> as well as the functional programs of their constituents, there will certainly be a more complete idea of how <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> evade from immunosurveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This knowledge will help to identify new targets for the development of therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
