<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Currently, the TNM classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e> based on clinicopathological staging remains the standard for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) prognostication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we identified the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative phosphorylation chain as a consistently overrepresented category in the published gene expression profiling (GEP) studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated associations of putative regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes from the oxidative phosphorylation chain with survival and disease prognosis in 613 CRC patients from Northern Germany (PopGen cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two SNPs in the 3' untranslated region of UQCRB (complex III), rs7836698 and rs10504961, were associated with overall survival (HR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.85 and HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.99, for TT carriers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These associations were restricted to the group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> located in the colon (HR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.82 and HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that both markers might act as independent prognostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the TT carriers were ~2 times more likely to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in the colon than in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs in COX6B1 (complex IV) were associated with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in a dominant model (rs6510502, OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.20-2.57; rs10420252, OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.11-2.53); rs6510502 was associated also with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.09-2.56 in a dominant model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report suggesting that markers in genes from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative chain might be prognostic factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional studies replicating the presented findings are needed </plain></SENT>
