<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: From 2006 to 2008, an audit of the multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in the western part of the Netherlands was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether compliance with guidelines had improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with newly diagnosed and surgically treated colon (n = 1,667) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (n = 544) stage I-III were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine quality indicators were derived from the evidence-based guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to compare hospital performances, hospital results were adjusted for casemix differences between hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon cancer</z:hpo> patients showed an increase in the examination of 10 or more lymph nodes (from 53% to 78%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients there was an increase in preoperative visualisation of the total colon (63-74%, P��= 0.02), MRI (73-85%, P = 0.003), radiotherapy (from 82% to 93% for patients &lt;75 years, P = 0.01) and examination of at least 10 lymph nodes (40-55%, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2006, standardised hospital performances differed widely for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> quality indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two years later, hospital performances for some quality indicators were more similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After the feedback of benchmark information, compliance with guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients improved, and differences between individual hospitals decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although secular trends cannot be ruled out, it is highly likely that these results can be attributed to the audit </plain></SENT>
