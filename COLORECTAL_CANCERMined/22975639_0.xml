<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Many patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) present with regional or widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, partially reflecting limitations of the current screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to find a complementary marker that can improve the diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Concentrations of cell-free DNA based on Alu (Alu-based CFD) in 31 unselected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, 30 intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> patients and 92 healthy individuals were detected by branch DNA (bDNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were detected by ARCHITECT assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was significant difference in concentrations of CFD between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> patients or healthy individuals (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in CFD in different subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with respect to gender, age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site and pathologic stage, suggesting that CFD might be an independent marker relative to CEA and CA19-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between pathologic stage and CEA or CA19-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no significant correlation was observed between pathologic stage and CFD, CFD (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.904) seemed to be a better indicator to distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> patients as compared with CEA (AUC=0.681) or CA19-9 (AUC=0.651) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CFD was more accurate than CEA or CA19-9 in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination of CFD, CEA and CA19-9 may be a better option for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than any of them used alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Discrimination <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> patients with CFD and staging with CEA and CA19-9 may substantially improve the accuracy <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
