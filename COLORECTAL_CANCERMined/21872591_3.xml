<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has become increasingly clear that microRNAs play an important role in many human diseases including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that expression of miR-21 in HEK293 and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells was found inversely correlated with ras homolog gene family, member B (RhoB) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>miR-21 expression significantly suppressed RhoB 3' UTR luciferase-reporter activity, but the inhibitory effect was lost when the putative target sites were mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exogenous miR-21 over-expression mimicked the effect of RhoB knockdown in promoting proliferation and invasion and inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, whereas anti-miR-21 or RhoB expression yielded opposite effects, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that miR-21 is a regulator of RhoB expression and RhoB could be a useful target in exploring the potential therapeutic benefits of miR-21 mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell behaviors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
