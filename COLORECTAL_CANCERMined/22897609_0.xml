<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prognostic significance of body mass index (BMI) and visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in 273 patients with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area were measured on digital images of patients' computed tomograms obtained before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups according to the cut-off levels of VFA proposed by Oka et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men with a VFA of ≥130 cm(2) and women with a VFA of ≥90 cm(2) were classified as <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (VFA-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>) and the others were classified as non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (VFA-non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were also divided into an overweight group and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range group, according to their preoperative BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in cumulative recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) or overall survival (OS) between the VFA-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group and the VFA-non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients with Dukes' C disease (n = 100) there was no statistically significant difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and OS between the VFA-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group and the VFA-non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were similar when the patients were classified according to their BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> nor increased visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> has any influence on outcomes in patients with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
