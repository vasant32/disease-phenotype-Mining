<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-eight patients without any previous treatment underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT examinations and subsequent operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lymph nodes were evaluated by recording short diameter and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on axial images and were carefully verified on the surgically resected specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The radiologic diagnostic efficacies on the basis of different diagnostic criteria were compared and evaluated with pathologic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference for SUVmax between metastatic and benign juxtaintestinal lymph nodes (F = 96.836, P = .000) and a correlation between size and SUVmax in metastatic juxtaintestinal lymph nodes (r = 0.352, P = .038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosing according to short diameter ≥ 10 mm and SUVmax ≥ 2.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positivity prediction value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>), and negative prediction value (NPV) were 10.00%, 98.26%, 66.67%, and 75.84% and 82.50%, 90.43%, 75.00%, and 93.69%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considered together, the sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, and NPV were 10.00%, 99.13%, 80.00%, and 76.00%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic curves showed that the best cutoff values for SUVmax and short diameter were 2.0 and 4.85 mm, respectively; the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, and NPV, were 91.43%, 87.83%, 69.57%, and 97.12% and 85.71%, 60.87%, 40.00%, and 98.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considered together, the sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, and NPV were 95.00%, 86.96%, 71.70%, and 98.04%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49134">Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake was a more reliable indicator in diagnosing malignant juxtaintestinal lymph node of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The optimal diagnostic efficacy could be reached by considering morphologic and functional features together </plain></SENT>
