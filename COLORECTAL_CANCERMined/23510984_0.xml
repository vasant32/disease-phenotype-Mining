<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy and safety of conatumumab (an agonistic monoclonal antibody against human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor 5) and ganitumab (a monoclonal antibody against the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor) combined with standard FOLFIRI chemotherapy as a second-line treatment in patients with mutant KRAS mCRC.Patients and methodsPatients with mutant KRAS metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon or rectum refractory to fluoropyrimidine- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to receive intravenous FOLFIRI plus conatumumab 10 mg/kg (Arm A), ganitumab 12 mg/kg (Arm B), or placebo (Arm C) Q2W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).ResultsIn total, 155 patients were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median PFS in Arms A, B, and C was 6.5 months (HR, 0.69; P = 0.147), 4.5 months (HR, 1.01; P = 0.998), and 4.6 months, respectively; median overall survival was 12.3 months (HR, 0.89; P = 0.650), 12.4 months (HR, 1.27; P = 0.357), and 12.0 months; and objective response rate was 14%, 8%, and 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common grade â‰¥3 adverse events in Arms A/B/C included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (30%/25%/18%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (18%/2%/10%).ConclusionsConatumumab, but not ganitumab, plus FOLFIRI was associated with a trend toward improved PFS </plain></SENT>
