<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent to which surveillance practice is consistent with guideline recommendations or may vary by age is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cohorts of adult patients diagnosed with breast (n = 6205) and colorectal (n = 2297) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> between 2000 and 2008 and treated with curative intent in 4 geographically diverse managed care environments were identified via <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to describe time to initial and subsequent receipt of surveillance services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the relation between patient characteristics and receipt of metastatic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 18 months of treatment, 87.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors received recommended mammograms, with significantly higher rates noted for patients aged 50 years to 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, only 55.0% received recommended colon examinations, with significantly lower rates for those aged â‰¥ 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of breast (64.7%) and colorectal (73.3%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors received nonrecommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> testing include white race (hazards ratio [HR], 1.13), comorbidities (HR, 1.17), and younger age (HR, 1.13; 1.15; 1.13 for age groups: &lt;50, 50-64, and 65-74 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, these factors included younger age (HR, 1.31; 1.25 for age groups: &lt;50 and 50-64 respectively) and comorbidities (HR, 1.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among an insured population, wide variation regarding the use of surveillance care was found by age and relative to guideline recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors were found to have high rates of both guideline-recommended recurrence testing and non-guideline-recommended metastatic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only approximately 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors received recommended tests but greater than 67% received metastatic testing </plain></SENT>
