<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The policy of redistributing surgical case volume toward designated high-volume hospitals to improve outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is supported by an international literature on volume-outcome association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> under the care of one surgeon at a non-high-volume hospital 1995-2005 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5-year overall survival probability and 30-day operative mortality were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and forty patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean annual surgeon caseload was 21.6 (SD 4.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5-year overall survival probability was 57.1% (95% confidence interval Â±7.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>30-day operative mortality was 4.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Estimates of outcome were not different from publically available values from a high-volume unit in Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that concentrating case volume per se may not improve outcome to the extent desired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> outcome is just as likely to derive from wider screening, better surgical training, and adequately powered clinical research, should these accompany centralisation </plain></SENT>
