<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Molecular testing for KRAS and BRAF mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue is a fundamental tool to identify patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) who are eligible for anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here report a molecular analysis by high-resolution melting analysis and direct sequencing of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA hot spot mutations in 209 Italian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ten patients (51%) were identified who were potentially nonresponders to anti-EGFR therapy: 90/209 patients (43%) harboring KRAS mutations, 13/117 (11.1%) with the V600E BRAF mutation, and 7/209 (3.3%) with mutations in PIK3CA exon 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations was significantly higher in patients older than 65 years (p=0.014 and p=0.018), while patients with triple-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were significantly younger than mutation carriers (p=0.000011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with gene mutations also showed a trend towards preferential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location in the colon (p=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, although involving a relatively small number of samples, we report the presence of a discordant mutational profile between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> and secondary lesions (3/9 patients), suggesting that it is worthwhile to test other available tissues in order to better define the efficacy of targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further correlations of specific clinical features with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mutational profile could be helpful to predict the response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients to monoclonal antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
