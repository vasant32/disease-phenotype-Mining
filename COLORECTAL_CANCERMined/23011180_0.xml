<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification and characterization of new targets for LBH589 action would further enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in HDACi therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-associated protein kinase (DAPK) in LBH589-induced cytotoxicity has not been investigated to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stable DAPK knockdown (shRNA) and DAPK overexpressing (DAPK+++) cell lines were generated from HCT116 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LBH589 inhibited cell proliferation, reduced the long-term survival, and up-regulated and activated DAPK in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LBH589 significantly suppressed the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> xenografts and in accordance with the in vitro studies, increased DAPK levels were detected immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LBH589 induced a DAPK-dependent autophagy as assessed by punctuate accumulation of LC3-II, the formation of acidic vesicular organelles, and degradation of p62 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LBH589-induced autophagy seems to be predominantly caused by DAPK protein interactions than by its kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caspase inhibitor zVAD increased autophagosome formation, decreased the cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP but didn't rescue the cells from LBH589-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in crystal violet staining suggesting both caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22689">Bafilomycin A1</z:chebi> caused caspase 3-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a DAPK-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altogether our data suggest that DAPK induces autophagy in response to HDACi-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In autophagy deficient cells, DAPK plays an essential role in committing cells to HDACi-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
