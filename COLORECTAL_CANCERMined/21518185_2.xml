<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who had a diagnosis of synchronous or metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) after 1 February 2006 were eligible to be included in the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on patient details, disease characteristics, investigations, histopathology and treatment were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease-specific survival data were assessed using Kaplan-Meier product moment estimates and the log-rank test of equality was used for comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1544 patients have been entered as of 22 March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 54.7% of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were in the rectosigmoid area, 92.9% of them <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, 52.6% of patients received chemotherapy and 15% had radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two hundred five patients underwent liver resection, nine had radiofrequency ablation and seven had selective internal radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall 3-year survival from time of diagnosis of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 29.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant survival difference between patients with synchronous and metachronous metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with lung- or liver-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> have significantly improved survival if they underwent surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The treatment of patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> continues to progress with modern medical and surgical developments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Important insights into the current patterns of care and clinical outcomes for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are provided by these data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, this registry provides a feasible and useful database for the evaluation of current treatments established as best evidence in this population </plain></SENT>
