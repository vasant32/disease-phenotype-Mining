<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The E-twenty-six (ETS) family of transcription factors is known to act as positive or negative regulators of the expression of genes that are involved in diverse biological processes, including those that control cellular proliferation, differentiation, hematopoiesis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, tissue remodeling, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of target gene promoters of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and oncogenic transcription factors provides new insights into the regulation of genes that are involved in the control of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present investigation was to analyze the differential expression of 11 ETS (ELF-3, ESE3, ETS1, ETV3, ETV4, ETV6, NERF, PDEF, PU1, Spi-B, and Spi-C) as potential markers for prognostic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of paired tissue biopsies consisting of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and a non-affected control sample were harvested from 28 individuals suffering from diagnosed colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated from the samples, and after reverse transcription, differential expression of the select ETS was carried out through real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> staging as determined by histopathology was carried out to correlate the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasiveness with the expression of the ETS genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated a different quantitative profile of expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ETV4 was significantly upregulated with further increase in the event of lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PDEF and Spi-B presented downregulation, which was more significant when lymph node involvement was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings were supported by immunohistochemistry of tumoral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that select ETS may serve as potential markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> invasiveness and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
