<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population and surgery is often the only definitive management option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The suitability of surgical candidates based on age alone has traditionally been a source of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection may be considered detrimental in the elderly solely on the basis of advanced age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on recent evidence suggesting that age alone is not a predictor of outcomes, Western societies are increasingly performing definitive procedures on the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such evidence is not available from our region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether age has an independent effect on complications after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent surgery for pathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi between January 1999 and December 2008 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a cut-off of 70 years, patients were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics and postoperative complications and 30-day mortality were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with clinically relevant variables to determine whether age had an independent and significant association with the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 271 files were reviewed, of which 56 belonged to elderly patients (â‰¥ 70 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The gender ratio was equal in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients had a significantly higher comorbidity status, Charlson score and American society of anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) class (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Upon multivariate analysis, factors associated with more complications were <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> status (95% CI = 1.30-6.25), preoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (95% CI = 1.94-48.0) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e> (95% CI = 1.21-5.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Old age was significantly associated with systemic complications upon univariate analysis (p = 0.05), however, this association vanished upon multivariate analysis (p = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Older patients have more co-morbid conditions and higher <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> scores, but increasing age itself is not independently associated with complications after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore patient selection should focus on the clinical status and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class of the patient rather than age </plain></SENT>
