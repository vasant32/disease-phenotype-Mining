<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TLR7 and 9 expression is altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control; which is proposed to be correlated with adenomacarcinoma progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fact that other TLRs were not observed to be differentially expressed is in contrast with published reports; which could be explained by the limitations of the employed method and disregarding the spatiotemporal variation in TLR expression pattern </plain></SENT>
