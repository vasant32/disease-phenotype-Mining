<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects aged 60-69 are being invited to complete three guaiac faecal occult blood tests (6 windows) every 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The programme aims to reduce mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by 16% in those invited for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects eligible for screening in the National Health Service in England are included on one database, which is populated from National Health Service registration data covering about 98% of the population of England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This analysis is only of subjects invited to participate in the first (prevalent) round of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By October 2008 almost 2.1 million had been invited to participate, with tests being returned by 49.6% of men and 54.4% of women invited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Uptake ranged between 55-60% across the four provincial hubs which administer the programme but was lower in the London hub (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 1.08 million returning tests 2.5% of men and 1.5% of women had an abnormal test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>17,518 (10,608 M, 6910 F) underwent investigation, with 98% having a colonoscopy as their first investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (n=1772) and higher risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (n=6543) were found in 11.6% and 43% of men and 7.8% and 29% of women investigated, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>71% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were 'early' (10% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, 32% Dukes A, 30% Dukes B) and 77% were left-sided (29% rectal, 45% sigmoid) with only 14% being right-sided compared with expected figures of 67% and 24% for left and right side from UK <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this first round of screening in England uptake and fecal occult blood test positivity was in line with that from the pilot and the original European trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although there was the expected improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage at diagnosis, the proportion with left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> was higher than expected </plain></SENT>
