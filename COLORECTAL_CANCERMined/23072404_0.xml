<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of this study was to examine these associations in 584 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases from a Swedish prospective population-based cohort including 28098 men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven anthropometric factors; height, weight, bodyfat percentage, hip circumference, waist circumference, BMI and waist-hip ratio (WHR) were categorized into quartiles of baseline anthropometric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, total risk as well as risk of different TNM stages, and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> located to the colon or rectum, were calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, women and men, respectively, using multivariate Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, as defined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anthropometric variables, was significantly associated with an overall increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in both women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While none of the anthropometric measures was significantly associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> (T)-stage 1 and 2 tumours, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anthropometric variables were significantly associated with an increased risk of T-stage 3 and 4, in particular in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In men, increasing quartiles of weight, hip, waist, BMI and WHR were significantly associated with an increased risk of lymph node positive (N1 and N2) disease, and risk of both non-metastatic (M0) and metastatic (M1) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, there were no or weak associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and risk of node-positive disease, but statistically significant associations between <z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>increased weight</z:mp>, bodyfat percentage, hip, BMI and M0 disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there was an increased risk of colon but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in men, and rectal but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in women, by increased measures of weight, hip-, waist circumference and bodyfat percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to show a relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, measured as several different anthropometric factors, and an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> of more advanced clinical stage, in particular in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> differs according to the method of characterising <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and also according to gender, location, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
