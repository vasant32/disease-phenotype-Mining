<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Perfusion CT may have the potential to quantify the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to identify the practical and technical challenges inherent to the technique, and evaluate its feasibility in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 51 patients from 2 institutions prospectively underwent a single perfusion CT on 2 different multidetector scanners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were advised to breath-hold as long as possible, followed by shallow breathing, and were given intravenous buscopan to reduce movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Numerous steps were explored to identify the challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 43 patients successfully completed the perfusion CT as per protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inability to detect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> (n=3), misplacement of dynamic sequence co-ordinates (n=2), failure of contrast injection (n=2) and displacement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> (n=1) were the reasons for failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 14 cases excessive respiratory motion displaced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> out of the scanning field along the temporal sequence, leading to erroneous data capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In nine patients, minor displacements of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> were corrected by repositioning the region of interest (ROI) to its original position after reviewing each dynamic sequence slice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was stable, and data captured from the ROI were representative, and could have been analysed by commercially available Body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Perfusion 3.0® software (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data were manually analysed by MATLAB® processing software (MathWorks, Cambridge, UK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Perfusion CT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> susceptible to motion during acquisition makes accurate data capture challenging and requires meticulous attention to detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Motion correction software is essential if perfusion CT is to be used routinely in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
