<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frozen sections (12 μm thick) were analyzed by means of DESI imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) with spatial resolution of 100 μm using a computer-controlled DESI imaging stage mounted on a high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESI-IMS data were found to predominantly feature complex <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24848">inositols</z:chebi>, phophatidyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16000,23981">ethanolamines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi>-serines, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16000,23981">ethanolamine</z:chebi> plasmalogens, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerols</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi>, and sulfatides among others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular constituents were identified based on their exact mass and MS/MS fragmentation spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An identified set of molecules was found to be in good agreement with previously reported DESI imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different histological tissue types were found to yield characteristic mass spectrometric data in each individual section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological features were identified by comparison to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin stained neighboring sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ions specific to certain histological tissue types (connective tissue, smooth muscle, healthy mucosa, healthy liver parenchyma, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) were identified by semi-automated screening of data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While each section featured a number of tissue-specific species, no potential global biomarker was found in the full sample set for any of the tissue types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As an alternative approach, data were analyzed by principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) which resulted in efficient separation of data points based on their histological types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A pixel-by-pixel tissue identification method was developed, featuring the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>/LDA analysis of authentic data set, and localization of unknowns in the resulting 60D, histologically assigned LDA space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Novel approach was found to yield results which are in 95% agreement with the results of classical histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation status was determined for each sample by standard molecular biology methods and a similar <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>/LDA approach was developed to assess the feasibility of the determination of this important parameter using solely DESI imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> samples fully separated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DESI-MS and molecular biology results were in agreement in 90% of the cases </plain></SENT>
