<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the KRAS status in 61 tumors from cetuximab-treated mCRC patients by both direct sequencing and a high-sensitivity method: 2-step PCR restriction fragmentation length polymorphism (RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic effects in each mutational status were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidences of KRAS mutations determined by direct sequencing and 2-step PCR RFLP were 34.4 and 52.5%, respectively (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized into 3 groups [W/W, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> by both methods (n = 29); W/M, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> by direct sequencing, detected mutation by 2-step PCR RFLP (n = 11); M/M, mutant-type by both methods (n = 21)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response rate for cetuximab in the W/M group (0%) was the same as that in the M/M group, and was significantly lower than in the W/W group (41.4%) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival in the W/M group (11.0 weeks) was similar to that in the M/M group (8.0 weeks), and was significantly shorter than in the W/W group (18.0 weeks) (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-sensitivity KRAS mutation testing is useful for selecting true responders to cetuximab </plain></SENT>
