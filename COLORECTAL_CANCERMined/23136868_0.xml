<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of the KRAS genotype in L-L and other or multiple metastatic (O/MM) MCRC patients treated with the FIr-B/FOx regimen was retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tumoral and metastatic samples were screened for KRAS codon 12 and 13 and BRAF mutations by SNaPshot and/or direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fit MCRC patients &lt;75 years were consecutively treated with FIr-B/FOx regimen: weekly 12-h timed flat-infusion/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (TFI 5-FU) 900 mg/m2, days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23; irinotecan (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11) 160 mg/m2 plus BEV 5 mg/kg, days 1, 15; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (OXP) 80 mg/m2, days 8, 22; every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCRC patients were classified as L-L and O/MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activity and efficacy were evaluated and compared using log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 59 patients were evaluated: 31 KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (53%), 28 KRAS mutant (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 21.5 months median follow-up, objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were, respectively: KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> 90%, 14 months, 38 months; KRAS mutant 67%, 11 months, 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PFS and OS were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PFS and OS were significantly different in L-L compared to O/MM evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients, clinical outcome of 12 L-L compared to 18 O/MM was significantly different: PFS 21 versus 12 months and OS 47 versus 28 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In KRAS mutant patients, the clinical outcome of 13 L-L compared to 14 O/MM was not significantly different: PFS 11 months equivalently and OS 39 versus 19 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The KRAS genotype <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant does not significantly affect different clinical outcomes for MCRC patients treated with the first-line FIr-B/FOx intensive regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients with L-L disease may achieve a significantly prolonged clinical outcome due to integration with secondary liver surgery, with respect to KRAS mutant patients </plain></SENT>
