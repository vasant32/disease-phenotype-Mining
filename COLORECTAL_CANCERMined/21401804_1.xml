<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between January 2007 and April 2008, 64 patients with mCRC were enrolled in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment regimen was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collection of CTC from whole blood was performed at baseline and at 2 and 8-12 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isolation and enumeration of CTC was performed using immunomagnetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with ≥3 CTC at baseline and at 2 and 8-12 weeks had a shorter median progression-free survival (8.5, 7.3 and 1.9 months, respectively) than those with &lt;3 CTC (9.7, 10.4 and 9.1 months, respectively) (log-rank test: P = 0.047, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ≥3 CTC at 2 and 8-12 weeks had a shorter median overall survival (10.2 and 4.1 months, respectively) than those with &lt;3 CTC (29.1 and 29.1 months, respectively) (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A spurious early rise in carcinoembryonic antigen level was observed in 11 patients showing a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no rise in early CTC level was observed among responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data support the clinical utility of CTC enumeration in improving our ability to accurately assess treatment benefit and in expediting the identification of effective treatment regimens for individual Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
