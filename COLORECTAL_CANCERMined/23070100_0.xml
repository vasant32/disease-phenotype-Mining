<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This technical note describes the novel use of a curved, steerable needle to access symptomatic osseous lesions in the pelvis and sacrum for palliative percutaneous treatment that would otherwise be difficult to treat using conventional straight needles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone lesions</z:e> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>; the remaining had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 2), colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of the seven patients had lesions in the posterior acetabulum, and the two other patients had lesions in the sacrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of the seven patients received radiofrequency ablation followed by cementoplasty; three patients received cementation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a novel needle designed for vertebroplasty, which has an articulating tip allowing it to be guided into lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone lesions</z:e> located in difficult-to-access regions of the pelvis and sacrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were successfully treated with cementoplasty either with or without thermal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse events were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The needle was difficult to withdraw in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Steerable curved needles can be successfully used to treat lytic osseous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> with cementoplasty when lesions are located in sites that may be difficult to reach using conventional straight needles </plain></SENT>
