<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: As survival rates for patients treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) increase, it is important to consider the short- and long-term self-management needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current work aimed to explore perceived patient needs for advice on diet, activity and beliefs about the role of lifestyle for reducing disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors, aged between 27 and 84, participated in six focus groups in community locations in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors would welcome guidance on diet in the immediate posttreatment period to alleviate symptoms and fears about food choices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many participants actively sought lifestyle advice but experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, mixed messages, culturally inappropriate guidance and uncertainty about evidence of benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was scepticism over the role of diet and physical activity as causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, in part because people believed their lifestyles had been healthy and could not see how reinstating healthy behaviours would reduce future disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sense of changing lifestyle to 'stack the odds in their favour' (against recurrence) appeared a more meaningful concept than prevention per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those people who had made or maintained dietary changes highlighted the importance of these to contributing to wellbeing and a sense of control in their life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A dogmatic approach to lifestyle change may lead to perceptions of victim blaming and stigmatisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Personalised, evidence informed, guidance on lifestyle choices does appear to be a much needed part of care planning and should be built in to survivorship programmes </plain></SENT>
