<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the availability of multiple effective tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), screening rates are low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Greater understanding of barriers between screeners and nonscreeners may improve public health initiatives to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (CRCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a content analysis of 625 responses to the question: "Was there anything that would have made getting tested easier?" Respondents were patients at a multispecialty practice who participated in a behavioral intervention trial to increase CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using clinic records, we classified patients as early-screeners (&lt;6 months), late-screeners(6-12 months), and nonscreeners (&gt;12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both screeners and nonscreeners reported the same categories of barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, early-screeners predominantly cited dislike of test attributes such as bowel preparation, whereas nonscreeners cited concerns regarding finances and work and family responsibilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multilevel strategies that address scheduling barriers and external screening barriers may improve CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies may test hypotheses about mediators explaining how screeners overcome barriers </plain></SENT>
