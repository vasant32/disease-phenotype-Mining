<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, 3 recombinant genes were constructed as follows: GA733 tagged to the ER retention sequence KDEL (GA733K), GA733 fused to the immunoglobulin Fc fragment (GA733-Fc), and GA733-Fc fused to the ER retention sequence (GA733-FcK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to generate transgenic plants expressing recombinant genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of transgenes was confirmed by genomic PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot, confocal immunofluorescence, and sandwich ELISA showed the expression of recombinant proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stability, flexibility, and bioactivity of recombinant proteins were analyzed and demonstrated through N-glycosylation analysis, animal trials, and sera ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the KDEL retained proteins in ER with oligomannose glycan structure and enhanced protein accumulation level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sera of mice immunized with GA733-FcK purified from plants contained immunoglobulins which were at least as efficient as the mammalian-derived GA733-Fc at recognizing human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, a plant system can be used to express the KDEL fusion protein with oligomannose glycosylation, and this protein induces an immune response which is comparable to non-KDEL-tagged, mammalian-derived proteins </plain></SENT>
