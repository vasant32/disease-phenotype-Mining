<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is one of the leading causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous cellular events, including deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), specifically the family of miR-34 consisting of miR-34a, b and c, is known to regulate the processes of growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the expression of miR-34 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissue specimens compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we also assessed the expression of miR-34 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines treated with our newly developed synthetic analogue of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> referred as difluorinated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (CDF) compared to well known inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> transferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the expression of miR-34a and miR-34c was down-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> specimens compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa and the loss of expression was also consistent with data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This down-regulation was attributed to promoter hypermethylation, because we found that the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with 5-aza-2Â´-deoxycytidine, a methyltransferase inhibitor, markedly induced the levels of miR-34a and miR-34c expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, CDF was very effective in the re-expression of miR-34a and miR-34c, which was consistent with inhibition of cell growth of both chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The re-expression of miR-34 led to a marked reduction in the expression of its target gene, Notch-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The loss of expression of miR-34 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> is in part due to promoter hypermethylation of miR-34, which can be re-expressed with our novel agent CDF, suggesting that CDF could be a novel demethylating agent for restoring the expression of miR-34 family, and thus CDF could become a newer therapeutic agent for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
