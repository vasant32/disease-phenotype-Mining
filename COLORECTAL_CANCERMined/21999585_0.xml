<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though progress is being made within surgery and other complementary treatments, there is still need for new and more effective treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oncolytic virotherapy, meaning that a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is cured by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, is a promising field for finding new and improved treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the oncolytic potential of several low-pathogenic echoviruses with rare clinical occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echoviruses are members of the enterovirus genus within the family Picornaviridae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines (CaCo-2, HT29, LoVo, SW480, SW620 and T84) were infected by the human enterovirus B species echovirus 12, 15, 17, 26 and 29, and cytopathic effects as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication efficacy were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infectivity was also tested in spheroids grown from HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Echovirus 12, 17, 26 and 29 replicated efficiently in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines and were considered highly cytolytic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The infectivity of these four viruses was further evaluated in artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (spheroids), where it was found that echovirus 12, 17 and 26 easily infected the spheroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have found that echovirus 12, 17 and 26 have potential as oncolytic agents against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, by comparing the cytolytic capacity of five low-pathogenic echoviruses in six <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines and in artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
