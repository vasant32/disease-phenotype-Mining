<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Scottish national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Males and females aged 50-74 years received a faecal occult blood test by post to complete at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were randomized to receive in addition: the pre-notification letter, the pre-notification letter + information booklet, or the usual invitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 59,953 subjects were included in the trial between 13/04/09 and 29/05/09 and followed to 27/11/09 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-notification letters were posted two weeks ahead of the screening test kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Uptake was defined as the return of a screening test and chi-squared tests compared uptake between the trial arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression assessed the impact of the letter and letter + booklet on uptake independently of gender, age, deprivation and screening round </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Uptake was higher with both the letter (59.0%) and the letter + booklet (58.5%) compared with the usual invitation (53.9%, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This increased uptake was seen for males, females, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> deprivation categories including least deprived females (letter 69.9%, usual invitation 66.6%) and most deprived males (42.6% vs. 36.1%), the groups with the highest and lowest levels of uptake respectively in the pilot screening rounds conducted prior to the roll out of the programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Uptake with the pre-notification letter compared with the usual invitation was higher both unadjusted and adjusted for demographic factors (odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.193-1.294) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pre-notification is an effective method of increasing uptake in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening for both genders and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age and deprivation groups </plain></SENT>
