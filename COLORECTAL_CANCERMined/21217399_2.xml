<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the current study were to examine the trends in incidence rates of subsite-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages in a large US population and to explore the impact of age and sex on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 9 registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence was divided into 3 anatomic subsite groupings: proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates and relative risk were calculated using the SEER*Stat software provided by the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1976 to 2005, age-adjusted incidence of proximal colon, distal colon, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> per 100,000 population have steadily decreased from 22.5, 18.8, and 19.2 to 21.1, 11.7, and 13.6, respectively, contributing to the overall decline in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from 60.5 to 46.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> had the greatest incidence decline (-37.79%), whereas the most minimal change in the incidence rates occurred for proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (-6.37%) because of increased incidence rates of ascending colon (24.8%) and hepatic flexure (21.3%) over 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The steadily increased proportion of proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> subsites was observed in both men and women starting at age 50 although women experienced a greater increase than did men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> decreased over the past 3 decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percent of ascending colon and hepatic flexure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> diagnosed at early stages (localized and regional) increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The finding on sex difference over years suggests that great attention should be paid in the future studies to male and female disparities </plain></SENT>
