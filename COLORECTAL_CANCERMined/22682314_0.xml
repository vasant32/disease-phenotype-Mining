<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These structures can induce mutagenesis, chromosomal translocations and genomic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wanted to determine if proteins that bind triplex DNA structures are quantitatively or qualitatively different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue and if this binding activity correlates with patient clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Extracts from 63 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues were examined by gel shifts (EMSA) for triplex DNA-binding proteins, which were correlated with clinicopathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics using the Mann-Whitney U, Spearman's rho, Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox log-rank tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biotinylated triplex DNA and streptavidin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> affinity binding were used to purify triplex-binding proteins in RKO cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and reverse-phase protein array were used to measure protein expression in tissue extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased triplex DNA-binding activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extracts correlated significantly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024228" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphatic disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and reduced overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified three multifunctional splicing factors with biotinylated triplex DNA affinity: U2AF65 in cytoplasmic extracts, and PSF and p54nrb in nuclear extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Super-shift EMSA with anti-U2AF65 antibodies produced a shifted band of the major EMSA H3 complex, identifying U2AF65 as the protein present in the major EMSA band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>U2AF65 expression correlated significantly with EMSA H3 values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> extracts and was higher in extracts from Stage III/IV vs. Stage I/II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> (p=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EMSA H3 values and U2AF65 expression also correlated significantly with GSK3 beta, beta-catenin, and NF- B p65 expression, whereas p54nrb and PSF expression correlated with c-Myc, cyclin D1, and CDK4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EMSA values and expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three splicing factors correlated with ErbB1, mTOR, PTEN, and Stat5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Western blots confirmed that full-length and truncated beta-catenin expression correlated with U2AF65 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased triplex DNA-binding activity in vitro correlates with lymph node disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and reduced overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and increased U2AF65 expression is associated with total and truncated beta-catenin expression in high-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
