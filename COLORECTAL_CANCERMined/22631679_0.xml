<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limited data on QoL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, especially in Malaysia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study was performed focusing on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stages and age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cross sectional study was conducted from June to September 2011 at three public tertiary hospitals with the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire in addition to face to face interview and review of medical records of 100 respondents </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean global health status (GHS) score was 79.1 (SD 21.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean scores for functional status (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, social) rangeds between 79.5 (SD 26.6) to 92.2 (SD 13.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean symptom scores (<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, dyspnoea, loss of appetite) ranged between 4.00 (SD 8.58) to 20.7 (SD 30.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Respondents role function significantly deteriorates with increasing stage of the disease (p=0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Females had worse symptoms of pain (p=0.022), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (p=0.031) and dyspnoea (p=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> (p=0.006) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (p=0.024) demonstrated significant differences between age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: QOL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients in this study was comparable to that in other studies done in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pain, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and dyspnoea are worse among female <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Given that functions deteriorates with advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis, a systematic screening programme to detect cases as early as possible is essential nationwide </plain></SENT>
