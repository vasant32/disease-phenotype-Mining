<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 30 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients with biopsy and corresponding subsequent surgical resection specimens were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutational analysis was performed on each biopsy sample as well as two separate samples from each resection specimen by PCR and Sanger sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, KRAS mutations were identified in 12/30 (40%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was 100% correlation between biopsy and resection specimens regarding the presence or absence of KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fact, the same point mutation was identified in both biopsy and corresponding resection specimens in 12/12 (100%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in two cases, there were two different point mutations detected within the same biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows perfect correlation between KRAS mutation status in biopsy and resection specimens from an individual patient, and suggests that biopsy material is adequate for KRAS mutational analysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
