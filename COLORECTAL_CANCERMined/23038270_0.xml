<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here combine live cell imaging and systems modeling to investigate caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> execution subsequent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that, although most cell lines that underwent MOMP also showed robust and fast activation of executioner caspases and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines LoVo and HCT-116 Smac(-/-), similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein (XIAP)-overexpressing HeLa (HeLa XIAP(Adv)) cells, only showed delayed and often no caspase activation, suggesting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> impairment subsequent to MOMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Employing APOPTO-CELL, a recently established model of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> subsequent to MOMP, this impairment could be understood by studying the systemic interaction of five proteins that are present in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway subsequent to MOMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using APOPTO-CELL as a tool to study detailed molecular mechanisms during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> execution in individual cell lines, we demonstrate that caspase-9 was the most important regulator in DLD-1, HCT-116, and HeLa cells and identified additional cell line-specific co-regulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Developing and applying a computational workflow for parameter screening, systems modeling identified that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> execution kinetics are more robust against changes in reaction kinetics in HCT-116 and HeLa than in DLD-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our systems modeling study is the first to draw attention to the variability in cell specific protein levels and reaction rates and to the emergent effects of such variability on the efficiency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> execution and on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> impairment subsequent to MOMP </plain></SENT>
