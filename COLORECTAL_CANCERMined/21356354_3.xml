<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to determine the expression of the sperm-associated antigen 9 gene (SPAG9) as a possible biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, to investigate its correlation with humoral immune response and different stages and grades in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and to explore its possible role in colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in vitro and in an in vivo mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPAG9 expression was determined by RT-PCR, in situ <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hybridization, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Humoral response against SPAG9 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SPAG9 gene silencing was performed using plasmid-based small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> to study various malignant properties of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients showed SPAG9 expression and generated humoral response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a close relationship between SPAG9 protein expression and humoral immune response in the majority of early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, indicating that anti-SPAG9 antibodies could be a novel serum biomarker for early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The down-regulation of SPAG9 (mediated by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) inhibited malignant properties in in vitro and significantly suppressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings collectively suggest that SPAG9 may have a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and early spread and thus could serve as a novel target for early detection and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
