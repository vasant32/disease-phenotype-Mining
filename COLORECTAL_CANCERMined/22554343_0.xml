<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that IRIS is also effective as first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria included inoperable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> with a confirmed diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, age â‰¥20 years, and no history of prior chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S-1 (40-60 mg twice daily) was given orally on Days 1 to 14, and irinotecan (100 mg/m(2)) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) were given intravenously on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints included overall response (OR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 52 eligible patients were enrolled from October 2007 through March 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In safety analysis, the incidences of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, 27%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 21%; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 57.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 16.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IRIS plus bevacizumab is a well-tolerated, highly effective chemotherapeutic regimen that is easy to administer </plain></SENT>
