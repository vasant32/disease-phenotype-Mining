<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) risk-adjustment model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery has been recently revised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the performance of the revised ACPGBI model, the original ACPGBI model, P-POSSUM, and CR-POSSUM, in the prediction of operative mortality after resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 423 patients who underwent potentially curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at a single institution (1997-2007) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data used in the construction of the ACPGBI model was collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The models were compared by examining observed to expected (O:E) ratios, the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) goodness-of-fit test, and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate was 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The performance of the models was as follows: revised ACPGBI model (O:E ratio = 1.05, AUC = 0.73, H-L = 11.02), original ACPGBI model (O:E ratio = 0.58, AUC = 0.76, H-L = 14.23), P-POSSUM (O:E ratio = 0.87, AUC = 0.79, H-L = 10.63), and CR-POSSUM (O:E ratio = 0.63, AUC = 0.84, H-L = 15.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analysis, the revised ACPGBI model performed well in both elective cases (O:E ratio = 1.06) and emergency cases (O:E ratio = 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The revised ACPGBI model is simple to construct and accurately predicts operative mortality after potentially curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
