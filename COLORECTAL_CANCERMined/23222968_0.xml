<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND SETTINGS: Thirty-three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors who participated in 8 gender- and health-related quality of life stratified focus groups and 130 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors who provided written comments to 2 open-ended questions on ostomy location and pouch problems participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on health maintenance organization members in Oregon, southwestern Washington, and northern California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Qualitative data were analyzed for the 8 focus groups and written comments from 2 open-ended survey questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discussions from the focu s groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Written content from the open-ended questions was derived from a mailed questionnaire on health-related quality of life in survivors with ostomies and analyzed using content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Discussions related to persistent ostomy-related issues more than 5 years after formation were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persistent ostomy-related issues were focused on clothing restrictions and adaptations, dietary concerns, issues related to ostomy equipment and self-care, and the constant need to find solutions to adjust and readjust to living with an ostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ostomy-specific concerns persist 5 years and more for long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors after initial ostomy formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adaptations tend to be individualized and based on trial and error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Findings underscore the need to develop long-term support mechanisms that survivors can access to promote better coping and adjustment to living with an ostomy </plain></SENT>
