<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study included 111 patients with Dukes' stage B and 86 patients with Dukes' stage C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We selected multiple genetic markers, including the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated marker (CEA), epithelial markers(CK19 and CK20), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem-like cell marker(CD133), and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of these genes were detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, overall survival(OS) and disease-free survival(DFS) of Dukes' stage B and C patients who were positive for CEA, CK19, CK20, and/or CD133 (CEA/CK/CD133) were significantly worse than that in patients who were negative for these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By Cox progression analysis, it was demonstrated that CEA/CK/CD133 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> drainage vein blood was an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CEA/CK/CD133 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> detection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> drainage vein blood is a useful tool for the determination of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with Dukes' stage B and C who are in need of postoperative adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
