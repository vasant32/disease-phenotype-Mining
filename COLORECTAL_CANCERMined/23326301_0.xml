<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is aberrantly expressed in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and is correlated with clinicopathologic parameters in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed over-expression of SATB1 in 80 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and in 3 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines and found expression levels were strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation and stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of SATB1 protein were higher in poorly-differentiated as compared with well-differentiated cell lines, and both quantity and distribution patterns of SATB1 were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation and pTNM stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, we further investigated the effect of down regulation of SATB1 expression on malignant phenotypic features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells in vitro, and showed that SABT1 down-regulation negatively affected growth potential, anchorage-independent colony formation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell invasion, and resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SATB1 expression was positively associated with the expression of various biological and genetic markers, including Cyclin D1, MMP-2, NF-ÎºB, and PCNA, and was associated with loss of APC and BRAF(V600E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that SATB1 is involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
