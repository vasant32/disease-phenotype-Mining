<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Angiostatin and endostatin are endogenous inhibitors of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> with anticancer effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR), blood levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoetin 2 (Ang-2) are elevated for 2-4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, postoperative human plasma from weeks 2 and 3 after MICR has been shown to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which are critical to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This proangiogenic state may stimulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> early after MICR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery's impact on angiostatin and endostatin is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study's purpose is to determine perioperative plasma levels of these two proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients undergoing MICR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endostatin levels were assessed in 34 CRC patients and angiostatin levels in 30 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken preoperatively and on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 3 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; in a subset, samples were taken between POD 7 and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The late samples were bundled into 7-day blocks (POD 7-13, POD 14-20) and considered as single time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiostatin and endostatin plasma levels were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in duplicate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Student's t test were used to analyze endostatin and angiostatin data, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significance was set at P&lt;0.0125 (after Bonferroni correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in median plasma endostatin levels on POD 1, which returned to the preoperative level by POD 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between pre- and postoperative plasma angiostatin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR </plain></SENT>
