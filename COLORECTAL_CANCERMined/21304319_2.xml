<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate diagnostic performances of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET)/computed tomography (CT) as compared with CT in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence and in whom both FDG-PET/CT and CT were performed were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> detected lesions were characterized according to their number, size, and localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive histological or radiological follow-up was considered as the 'gold standard' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic performances of FDG-PET/CT and CT were calculated by lesion, globally and with respect to the site of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-six true-positive lesions were identified in 71 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT scan was positive in 58 (82%) patients and FDG-PET/CT in 70 (98%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In per lesion analysis, the global accuracy of FDG-PET/CT in detection of lesions was of 88% (sensitivity = 95%, specificity = 54%), which was higher than that of CT (53%, sensitivity = 55%, specificity = 43%), particularly in case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph nodes metastases</z:e> (100 vs. 35%) and locoregional lesions (100 vs. 39%) (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET/CT modified the clinical management in 31 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET/CT is more sensitive than CT for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence and can modify the management in 40% of patients </plain></SENT>
