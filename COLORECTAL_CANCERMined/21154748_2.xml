<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we aimed to identify and characterize recurrent copy-number alterations (CNAs) associated with clinical outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by the use of single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> specimens and paired germline samples from 144 patients (40 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 104 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) as well as 40 CRC cell lines were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This large dataset revealed frequent loss, including homozygous loss, at chr16p13.2 (from 5.9 to 7.42Mb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The loss was observed in 30% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and even more frequently in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 56%, indicating that the loss define a subset of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with a propensity for invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, the loss occurred twice as frequent in villous (40%) as in tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The loss occurred independently of microsatellite stability and could be validated by qPCR in an independent sample cohort (n = 71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Stage II/III, microsatellite stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> it was associated with poor recurrence free survival (hazard ratio 2.4; p = 0.02; Multivariate Cox regression analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No transcriptional consequences of the losses were observed, and the only gene, A2BP1, located in the region showed no mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation with other CNAs was established for chr3p22 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and chr20p (inverse) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FISH documented the chr16p13.2 region to be involved in complex structural rearrangements that included translocation to chr3p22 in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that structural rearrangements involving chr16p13.2 are very frequent in colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, often lead to homozygous deletion, and are associated with poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
