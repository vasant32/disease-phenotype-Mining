<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 120 patients with mCRC who had progressed after irinotecan-containing first-line chemotherapy and were never treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>; 40 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS were accrued prospectively in the experimental arm (arm A), and 80 patients accrued retrospectively were divided into control arms B (n = 46) and C (n = 34) according to KRAS genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second-line treatments consisted of cetuximab plus irinotecan for arm A, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> plus either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (FOLFOX) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (CapeOX) for the control arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.3, 5.8 and 3.9 months, for arms A, B and C, respectively, with statistical significance favoring arm A (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in overall survival did not reach statistical significance (18.3 vs 12.6 vs 12.9, P = 0.138), although there was a trend toward longer overall survival in arm A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of benefit from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing regimens either as second-line or third-line therapy, the median PFS was 5.0 months in arms B and C as second-line therapy, and 4.0 months in arm A as third-line therapy, with no statistical significance (P = 0.385) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second-line cetuximab plus irinotecan is a valid treatment strategy for mCRC patients with irinotecan-refractory and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-naïve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> harboring <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy resulted in equivalent PFS both as a second-line and a third-line therapy, enabling delay of the administration of FOLFOX and CapeOX until subsequent treatment cycles </plain></SENT>
