<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 20 patients suspected of having 1-6 CRLM were included prospectively in this randomised cross-over study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liver MRI was performed with a one-week interval at 1.5 T and included T1-w VIBE and T2-HASTE, before and after administration of 1.6 g CMC-001 or 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastasis-to-liver</z:e> signal intensity (SI) ratio was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard of reference was histopathology after surgery, or combination of other imaging studies and/or follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AE) and clinicolaboratory tests were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 44 metastases, 41 were detected after CMC-001 (93%) and 42 after gadobenate dimeglumine (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen false-positive lesions were found after CMC-001 and 2 after gadobenate dimeglumine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastasis-to-liver</z:e> SI ratio was significantly higher after CMC-001 than after gadobenate dimeglumine (0.51 and 0.21 respectively, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More AE occurred after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> compared to gadobenate dimeglumine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CMC-001 is as sensitive as an extensive intravenous gadobenate dimeglumine protocol in detecting CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was relatively well tolerated but had higher rates of gastrointestinal AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS: • Liver MRI after ingestion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> is highly sensitive for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> • High false-positive rate necessitates further evaluation, in some cases • The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination time is short • Oral ingestion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> seems safe and relatively well tolerated by patients • <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25154">Manganese compounds</z:chebi> may be useful for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> surveillance after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
