<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The labeled amplicons were conjugated on Fe(3)O(4)/Au nanoparticles using Au-S linkages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alkaline phosphatases were then loaded onto the nanoparticles through <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-streptavidin interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resultant composite nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of 2-phospho-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29073">L-ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, the mutant alleles were quantified on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) from the anodic current of the enzymatic product, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BRAF V600E mutant alleles concentrations as low as 0.8% were successfully determined in an excess of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a cell-line dilution model, the proposed method was more sensitive than were DNA sequencing and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates a new strategy for sensitivly detecting BRAF V600E variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can pave the way for analyzing other rare mutations in complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples because of its high sensitivity, simplicity, low cost, and easy validation of assay procedures </plain></SENT>
