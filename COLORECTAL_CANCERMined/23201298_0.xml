<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To identify prognostic factors for survival and to assess the validity of Köhne's classification, in the era of targeted biotherapies, in patients treated with chemotherapy for non resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 290 consecutive patients were retrospectively identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gastroenterology units of one French county, between 2004 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis for overall survival were performed using pre-treatment patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were available for prognostic categorization in 133 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 22.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution and median survival for Köhne's prognostic groups were as following: good (n=73; 24.8 months), intermediate (n=35; 24.2 months), and poor (n=25; 7.0 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival difference was significant between good and poor prognostic groups (p&lt;0.01) and between intermediate and poor prognostic groups (p&lt;0.01), but not between good and intermediate prognostic groups (p=0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two independent prognostic factors of survival in multivariate analysis were performance status 0/1 (p&lt;0.01) and white blood cells count&lt;10×10/L (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of Köhne's classification is questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A simplified score could be validated by largest studies, based on white blood cells count and performance status </plain></SENT>
