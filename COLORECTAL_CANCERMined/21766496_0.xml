<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to assess the presence of MSI and promoter hypermethylation of MLH1 and MSH2 in Bulgarian PATIENTS WITH SPORADIC COLORECTAL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CANCER</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) AND TO ANALYZE THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON THE DEVELOPMENT, PROGRESSION AND PROGNOSIS OF THE DISEASE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined MSI in 126 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the methylation status of the MLH1 and MSH2 promoter regions in the cases with MSI/LOH by using a panel of 5 microsatellite markers (BAT26, D5S346, D18S35, D2S123 and FGA) and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-specific PCR (MSP) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> converted DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MSI/LOH was found in 36 (28.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 30 were analyzed for promoter hypermethylation of MLH1 and we detected hypermethylation in 15 (50%) of them, whereas promoter hypermethylation of MSH2 was observed only in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of MSI/LOH was associated with younger age (p=0.002), more advanced stage (III/IV stage) (p=0.029), lower degree of differentiation (p=0.001), and right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization (p=0.0002), but not with overall survival (log rank, p=0.566) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> with MSI/LOH are more aggressive, develop earlier and progress faster to more advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent cause of failure of DNA MMR system appeared to be the hypermethylation of CpG islands of the promoter region of MLH1, whereas the methylation of MSH2 was a rare event </plain></SENT>
