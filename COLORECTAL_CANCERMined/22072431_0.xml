<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ileocecal interposition (ICI) for first-line reconstruction after low anterior colorectal resection was introduced by von Fl√ºe and Harder in 1994 (Dis Colon Rectum 37:1160-1162, 1994) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience using this technique to bridge colonic gaps after significant loss of bowel length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2009 the left-sided colon was too short for traditional isoperistaltic reconstruction in six patients treated in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reasons for extensive bowel loss were a deficient (n = 3) or torn (n = 1) marginal artery with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or repeat colorectal resections (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ICI was done to bridge the gap and enable restoration of intestinal continuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whenever performing a coloanal anastomosis (4/6) a loop ileostomy was raised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with colonic diversion experienced graft-related complications: ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> of the interposed colonic segment, anastomotic stenosis, and a presacral sinus were observed and managed nonoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequent closure of the stoma was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A median Vaizey <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> score of 9 (range: 4-14) was recorded in the patient with coloanal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average number of bowel movements per day was 1.5 (range: 0.5-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When the descending colon does not reach the rectal stump or anal canal in reoperative cases or after vascular complication, ICI is a useful salvage procedure resulting in good bowel function </plain></SENT>
