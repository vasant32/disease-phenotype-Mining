<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An enhanced recovery pathway (ERP) was instituted, including preoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp>, limited intravenous fluids and opiates, and early feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> was administered as needed, but epidural <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> was not used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first 66 patients subjected to the ERP were case-matched by surgeon, procedure and age (within 5 years) with patients treated previously in a fast-track pathway (FTP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-term and postoperative outcomes to 30 days were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital stay was shorter with the ERP than the FTP: median (interquartile range, i.q.r.) 3 (2-3) versus 3 (3-5) days (P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 2-day hospital stay was achieved in 44 and 8 per cent of patients respectively (P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the ERP had a shorter time to recovery of bowel function: median (i.q.r.) 1 (1-2) versus 2 (2-3) days (P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day complication rates were similar (32 per cent ERP, 27 per cent FTP; P = 0·570) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Readmissions within 30 days were more common with ERP, but the difference was not statistically significant (10 versus 5 patients; P = 0·170) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total hospital stay for those readmitted was shorter in the ERP group (18 versus 23 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ERP decreased the length of hospital stay after minimally invasive colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
