<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Micropapillary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was originally reported to be an aggressive variant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo>, and it is associated with frequent lymphovascular invasion and a dismal clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has subsequently been found in other organs; however, at present, only a limited number of cases of colorectal micropapillary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> with extensive nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in a Japanese patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An 82-year-old man was found by colonoscopy to have a 20-mm pedunculated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> in his sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection of the sigmoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> was performed, and pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed a poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> component and a micropapillary component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> being confined within the submucosa, massive lymphatic invasion was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the patient underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with lymph node dissection, and multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our case suggests that when a micropapillary component is identified in a pre-operative biopsy specimen, even for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, surgical resection with adequate lymph node dissection would be required because of the high potential for nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
