<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that the nsSNPs variants play an important role in diseases, however it remained unclear how these variants are associated the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk associated SNPs have been discovered, however rs961253 (Lys25Arg at 20p12.3) located in the proximity of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) and fermitin family homolog 1 Fermt1 genes has been reported to be highly associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we provide evidence for the first time in silico biological functional and structural implications of non-synonymous (nsSNPs) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> disease-associated variant Lys25Arg via molecular dynamic (MD) simulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein structural analysis was performed with particular variant allele (A/C, Lys25Arg) and compared it with the predicted native protein structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that this nsSNPs will cause changes in the protein structure and as a result is associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the native and mutant 3D structures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> associated risk allele protein domain (CRAPD), they were also analyzed using solvent accessibility models for further protein stability confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, this study confirmed that this variant has functional effect and structural impact on the CRAPD and may important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> disease progression; hence it could be a reasonable approach for studying the effect of other deleterious variants in future studies </plain></SENT>
