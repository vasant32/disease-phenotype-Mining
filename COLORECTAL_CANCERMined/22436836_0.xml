<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Although numerous studies of the efficacy of exercise are reported, few studies have evaluated changes in characteristics of exercise dose in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> both during and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of exercise dose (i.e., frequency, duration, and intensity) and evaluate for differences in symptom severity (i.e., <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and pain) between women who did and did not exercise during and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a sample of 119 women, two groups were classified: exercisers and nonexercisers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exercisers were defined as women who met specific criteria for frequency (three times per week), duration (20 minutes/session), intensity (moderate), and mode (aerobic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonexercisers were defined as women who did not meet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of exercise dose was completed at baseline (T1: the week before chemotherapy cycle 2), at the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment (T2), and at the end of the study (T3: approximately one year after the T1 assessment) using self-report exercise questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 50% of the participants exercised during treatment and 70% exercised after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At T1, exercisers had lower total <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, lower behavioral and sensory subscale <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> scores, and lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores (P = 0.038) than nonexercisers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> or pain were found between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At T2, exercisers had lower cognitive/mood subscale <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores than nonexercisers (P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At T3, no significant differences were found between groups in any symptom severity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both during and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, achieving or maintaining exercise guideline levels were met by most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed to examine the link between exercise dose and symptom severity </plain></SENT>
