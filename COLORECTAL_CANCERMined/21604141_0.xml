<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to assess the role of CTC in excluding a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in older symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1,359 CTC studies performed between March 2002 and December 2007 were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gold standard was an endoscopic examination within 1 year and/or clinical, endoscopic and/or radiological follow-up until the time of data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients not diagnosed as having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> on CTC were assumed as true-negatives if the gold standard was negative and did not feature on the regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry (at least 18 months post-CTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After exclusions, 1,177 CTC studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were undertaken in 463 men and 714 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median age of patients undergoing CTC was 71 (range, 27-96) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>59 invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 34.5 (range 18-84) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and negative predictive value for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 94.9% (95% CI:84.9%-98.7%) and 99.7% (95% CI:99.1%-99.9%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTC has a high sensitivity and negative predictive value in excluding a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with colorectal symptoms </plain></SENT>
