<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The -93G&gt;A (rs1800734) polymorphism located in the promoter of mismatch repair gene, MLH1, has been identified as a low-penetrance variant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many published studies have evaluated the association between the MLH1 -93G&gt;A polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the association between the MLH1 -93G&gt;A polymorphism and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To derive a more precise estimation of the association, a meta-analysis of six studies (17,791 cases and 13,782 controls) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of these published studies were performed on subjects of known microsatellite instability (MSI) status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An additional analysis including 742 cases and 10,895 controls was used to assess the association between the MLH1 -93G&gt;A polymorphism and the risk of MSI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall results indicated that the variant genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (AG versus GG: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01-1.11; AA/AG versus GG: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01-1.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This increased risk was also found during stratified analysis of MSI status (AA versus GG: OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.94-3.28; AG versus GG: OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.10-1.52; AA/AG versus GG: OR = 1.45, 95% CI =���1.24-1.68; AA versus AG/GG: OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.78-2.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Egger's test did not show any evidence of publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the MLH1 -93G&gt;A polymorphism may contribute to individual susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and act as a risk factor for MSI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
