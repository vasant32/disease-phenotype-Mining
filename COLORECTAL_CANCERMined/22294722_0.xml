<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study examined potential correlations between markers related to the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway and clinical benefit from the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody cetuximab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiles for 70 pretreatment specimens from metastatic lesions of patients with chemorefractory mCRC receiving cetuximab monotherapy were analyzed using 74 predefined Gene-Chip probesets representing 33 unique IGF-1R pathway markers to determine correlations with progression-free survival (PFS) and disease control rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher IGF-1R, higher GRB(7), and lower INSIG(2) expression were associated with longer PFS with cetuximab in univariate analyses, particularly in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> K-Ras <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>: median, 122 versus 60 days (P = 0.01), 122 versus 57 days (P = 0.011), and 57 versus 156 days (P &lt; 0.0001), favoring higher IGF-1R, higher GRB(7), and lower INSIG(2) expression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lower IGF-1 expression was associated with a PFS benefit with cetuximab, whereas lower IGFBP(3) and INSR expression levels showed trends for a PFS benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower INSIG(2) expression (vs. higher expression) was associated with greater PFS in the high epiregulin-expressing group (P = 0.001), but not in the low-expressing cohort suggesting an effect independent from the previously reported effect of epiregulin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower INSIG(2) expression was also associated with higher disease control rate in the overall population (51.4% vs. 11.4%; P = 0.001) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> K-Ras subset (76.2% vs. 18.2%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that markers of the IGF-1R pathway may play a role in predicting benefit from cetuximab therapy in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional clinical studies are warranted to validate these findings </plain></SENT>
