<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The conventional implementations of proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) magnetic resonance thermometry (MRT) require the subtraction of single or multiple temporal references, a motion sensitive critical feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pilot study was conducted here to investigate the clinical feasibility of near-harmonic two-dimensional (2D) referenceless PRFS MRT, using patient data from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-guided laser ablation of liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PRFS MRT with respiratory-triggered multi-slice gradient-recalled (GRE) acquisition was performed under free breathing in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The precision of the novel referenceless MRT was compared with the reference phase subtraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coupling the referenceless MRT with a model-based, real-time compatible regularisation algorithm was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The precision of MRT was improved by a factor of 3.3 when using the referenceless method as compared to the reference phase subtraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The approach combining referenceless PRFS MRT and model-based regularisation yielded an estimated precision of 0.7° to 2.1°C, resulting in millimetre-range agreement between the calculated thermal dose and the 24 h post-treatment unperfused regions in liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The application of the near-harmonic 2D referenceless MRT method was feasible in a clinical scenario of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-guided laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) ablation in liver and permitted accurate prediction of the thermal lesion under free breathing in conscious patients, obviating the need for a controlled breathing under general anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
