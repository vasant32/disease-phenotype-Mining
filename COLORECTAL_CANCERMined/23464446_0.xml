<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: A retrospective data analysis was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2006 amongst Saudi patients in Jeddah using data retrieved from the Saudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (SCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Descriptive analysis was performed and results were compared to national <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> data from the SCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: In Jeddah, 644 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were diagnosed during the time period, accounting for 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases in KSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Males were more commonly affected than females (58% versus 42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The male preponderance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was similar to that observed at a national level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Jeddah, the incidence was higher among those &gt;45 years (77.0%), and the mean age at diagnosis was 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, 10% of patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>; 25% presented with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and the remaining patients had various stages of regional extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinomas</z:mp> accounted for 72% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis did not reveal any clinically significant differences between cases diagnosed in Jeddah and those diagnosed throughout KSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The increased trend in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Jeddah between 2000 and 2006 mirrors the recent trend in KSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This highlights the magnitude of this healthcare hazard, not only in Jeddah, but also across the country and supports the need for preventive measures and early detection of the disease </plain></SENT>
