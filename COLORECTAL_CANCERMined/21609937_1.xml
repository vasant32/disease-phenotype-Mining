<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phase I study investigated a novel regimen combining 2 chemotherapy drugs with proven efficacy in mCRC (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49603">lapatinib</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49603">Lapatinib</z:chebi> has already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of selected cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> responsive to fluoropyrimidines or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> were eligible for enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was given over a 21-day cycle with a fixed dosing of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> of 130 mg/m(2) on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49603">lapatinib</z:chebi> were given orally at escalating doses, starting at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1500 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-14 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49603">lapatinib</z:chebi> 1000 mg daily on days 1-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients received treatment per study protocol </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo> was one of the most common side effects and accounted for nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grade 3/4 toxicity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest the regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49603">lapatinib</z:chebi> has some efficacy in types of advanced or metastatic solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with known responsiveness to fluoropyrimidines or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
