<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening has been demonstrated to reduce both the incidence and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the large group with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> risk level, two further risk groups need to be distinguished: increased family risk and hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STANDARD METHODS FOR SCREENING: The highest evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screening tests has been demonstrated for guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy is a diagnostic and therapeutic tool and it serves as the reference standard for other tests in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INNOVATIONS: Fecal immunochemical tests have a higher sensitivity than guaiac-based tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several novel techniques are under development and could be adopted by screening programs in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Next to colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT) colonography and colon capsule endoscopy have the highest sensitivity for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular tests which are based on the detection of genetic and epigenetic changes of DNA released by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> into feces or blood have a high potential and could potentially replace occult blood tests in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Colonoscopy is the primary instrument for screening for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fecal occult blood testing should only be performed if colonoscopy is denied and CT colonography has not yet been approved for screening in Germany </plain></SENT>
