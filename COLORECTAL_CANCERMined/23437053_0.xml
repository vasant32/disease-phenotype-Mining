<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the association between the MTHFR 677C&gt;T polymorphism and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, a meta-analysis was held based on 71 published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible studies were identified through searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM) and CNKI database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The statistical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> across studies was examined with x(2)-based Q-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Begg's and Egger's test were also carried out to evaluate publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitive and subgroup analysis were also held in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 71 publications including 31,572 cases and 44,066 controls were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR 677 C&gt;T variant genotypes are significantly associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were also found among Caucasians for CC vs TT (OR=1.076; 95%CI= 1.008-1.150; I(2) =52.3%), CT vs TT (OR=1.102; 95%CI=1.032-1.177; I(2) =51.4%) and dominant model (OR=1.086; 95%CI=1.021-1.156; I(2) =53.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asians for CC vs TT (OR  =1.226; 95%CI  =1.116-1.346; I(2)  =55.3%), CT vs TT (OR  =1.180; 95%CI  =1.079-1.291; I(2)  =36.2%), recessive (OR  =1.069; 95%CI  =1.003-1.140; I(2)  =30.9%) and dominant model (OR  =1.198; 95%CI  =1.101-1.303; I(2)  =52.4%), and Mixed populations for CT vs TT (OR  =1.142; 95%CI  =1.005-1.296; I(2)  =0.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no associations were found in Africans for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that the MTHFR 677C&gt;T polymorphism increases the risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, while there is no association among Africans found in subgroup analysis by ethnicity </plain></SENT>
