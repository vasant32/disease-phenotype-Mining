<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are less likely than women to utilise <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> information services and other social support services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore and compare the experience and coping behaviour of men and women after treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A longitudinal qualitative study was conducted involving 38 individuals (24 men and 14 women) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were generated using semi-structured interviews at four time points over an 18-month period, post-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interviews focused on participant's experience of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and on how gender affected their coping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This paper reports the findings of interviews 3 and 4 which examined the participant's experience after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the interviews ('new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>', living with uncertainty and support needs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many men and women reacted similarly; however, there was some variation evident between and within sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main difference was with regard to the long-term physical side effects of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many women admitted to still experiencing side effects, whereas many men indicated that they had no problems </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from the physical and psychological effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> does not occur simultaneously </plain></SENT>
