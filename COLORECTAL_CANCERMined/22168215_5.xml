<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: About half of Americans 50 to 75 years old do not follow recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening guidelines, leaving 40 million individuals unscreened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A simple blood test would increase screening compliance, promoting early detection and better patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to demonstrate the performance of an improved sensitivity blood-based Septin 9 (SEPT9) methylated DNA test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study variables include clinical stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location and histologic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 50 untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients at 3 institutions; 94 control samples were collected at 4 US institutions; samples were collected from 300 colonoscopy patients at 1 US clinic prior to endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SEPT9 methylated DNA concentration was tested in analytical specimens, plasma of known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases, healthy control subjects, and plasma collected from colonoscopy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The improved SEPT9 methylated DNA test was more sensitive than previously described methods; the test had an overall sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of 90% (95% CI, 77.4% to 96.3%) and specificity of 88% (95% CI, 79.6% to 93.7%), detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (I and II) the test was 87% (95% CI, 71.1% to 95.1%) sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The test identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions, including proximal colon (for example, the cecum) and had a 12% false-positive rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a small prospective study, the SEPT9 test detected 12% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with a false-positive rate of 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A sensitive blood-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test using the SEPT9 biomarker specifically detects a majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages and colorectal locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The test could be offered to individuals of average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who are unwilling or unable to undergo colonscopy </plain></SENT>
