<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the biological characteristics and the tumorigenicity of spheres are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that sphere cells expressed high levels of the putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> stem cell markers CD133 and CD44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD133-positive rates were 13.27 ± 5.62, 52.71 ± 16.97 and 16.47 ± 2.45% in sphere cells, regular Colo205 cells and differentiated sphere cells, respectively, while the CD44-positive rates were 62.92 ± 8.38, 79.06 ± 12.10 and 47.80 ± 2.5%, respectively, and the CD133/CD44-double-positive rates were 10.77 ± 4.96, 46.89 ± 19.17 and 12.41 ± 2.27%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> spheres exhibited more tumorigenicity than regular Colo205 cells in a xenograft assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sphere cells displayed much higher oncogenicity than regular Colo205 cells to initiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, as assayed by H&amp;E staining, Musashi-1 staining and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicated that the sphere cells were enriched with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>), and exhibited more proliferation capacity, more differentiation potential and especially more tumorigenicity than regular Colo205 cells in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further isolation and characterization of these <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> may provide new insights for novel therapeutic targets and prognostic markers </plain></SENT>
