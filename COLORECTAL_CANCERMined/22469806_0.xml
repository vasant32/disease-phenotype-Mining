<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After extended left colectomy, it may be difficult to take down a well-vascularized colon into the pelvis and perform a tension-free colorectal or coloanal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Deloyers procedure comprising complete mobilization and rotation of the right colon while maintaining the ileocolic artery may be used in this circumstance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to report postoperative and long-term outcomes after the Deloyers procedure as a salvage technique for colorectal anastomosis or coloanal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: From a prospective database, we retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent a Deloyers procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was conducted at the Colorectal Unit in a tertiary referral teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Between 1998 and 2011, 48 consecutive patients underwent a Deloyers procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications were as following: Hartmann reversal (n = 17), previous colorectal anastomosis-related complications (n = 11), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> (n = 6), left <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (n = 6), ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (n = 3), iterative colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> local recurrence (n = 1), and synchronous <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 38 men and 10 women (median age at surgery, 67 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colorectal anastomosis and coloanal anastomosis were performed in 38 and 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients had defunctioning stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality and early morbidity rate was 2% and 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients (6%) had severe complications (Dindo â‰¥ 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was required in 2 patients for intra-abdominal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay was 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 26 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had their ileostomy closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three percent of patients developed late complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The median number of bowel movements per day was 3 (range, 1-7), but 67% of patients had fewer than 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>One patient required an ileostomy refashioning because of poor functional results, and 23% of patients routinely take <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6532">loperamide</z:chebi>-based medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: The retrospective nature of the study was a limitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Deloyers procedure is safe, associated with low morbidity and good long-term functional results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It represents a safe alternative to total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
