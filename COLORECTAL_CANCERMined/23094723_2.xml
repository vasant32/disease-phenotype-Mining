<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 1193 patients participating in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) study (a national, prospective, observational cohort study) who were alive 4 months after diagnosis and received chemotherapy for newly diagnosed metastatic (stage IV) lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to characterize the prevalence of the expectation that chemotherapy might be curative and to identify the clinical, sociodemographic, and health-system factors associated with this expectation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from a patient survey by professional interviewers in addition to a comprehensive review of medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 69% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and 81% of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> did not report understanding that chemotherapy was not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> likely to cure their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariable logistic regression, the risk of reporting inaccurate beliefs about chemotherapy was higher among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, as compared with those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29 to 2.37); among nonwhite and Hispanic patients, as compared with non-Hispanic white patients (odds ratio for Hispanic patients, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.51 to 5.27; odds ratio for black patients, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.80 to 4.78); and among patients who rated their communication with their physician very favorably, as compared with less favorably (odds ratio for highest third vs. lowest third, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Educational level, functional status, and the patient's role in decision making were not associated with such inaccurate beliefs about chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many patients receiving chemotherapy for incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> may not understand that chemotherapy is unlikely to be curative, which could compromise their ability to make informed treatment decisions that are consonant with their preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physicians may be able to improve patients' understanding, but this may come at the cost of patients' satisfaction with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(Funded by the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute and others.) </plain></SENT>
