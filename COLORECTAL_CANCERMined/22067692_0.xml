<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Illness is experienced in social contexts; its meaning is rooted in local beliefs and values as well as one's personal and family situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Health professionals are steeped in knowledge of disease but know much less about illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to learn more about the social construction of illness by comparing the meanings of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> in Thai and Canadian individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using an ethnoscience design, 10 Thai adults receiving chemotherapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were interviewed twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were asked to sort words and phrases about <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> from their first interview using Q-sort, triadic, and dyadic approaches; to name each pile; and to describe the similarities and differences between the piles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The card sorts were used to understand the relationships among key ideas in each interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A table summarizing the card sorts was constructed, and patterns in the data were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two segregates in the Thai data were identified: essential/constant and intermittent, with essential/constant including 2 segregates (feeble and altered cognition), and intermittent including 2 segregates (loss of mental strength and difficulty sleeping) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary meanings of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> in the Thai data were related to temporality, whereas the primary meanings of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> in the Canadian data were related to the location of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (mind/body) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings help us understand the social construction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, a common symptom in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Further research in relation to links between <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and other related-symptoms is needed with the goal of developing cross-cultural interventions for managing <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> in the future </plain></SENT>
