<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> syndrome are not obvious and the clinical definition is relatively arbitrary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that there are multiple phenotypes included in what is currently called hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed this review of a large series of patients who presented with multiple serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> to look for clinical patterns that may confirm our hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, colonoscopy, and clinical databases from a single institution were queried for patients meeting the following criteria: 1) ≥ 20 serrated colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>; 2) ≥ 5 serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> proximal to the sigmoid; 3) ≥ 2 serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥ 10 mm in size; 4) any serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in a person with at least one first-degree relative who has hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Records were reviewed for demographics, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> details, and personal or family history of colorectal extracolonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred fifteen patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 62 years and 56% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven percent were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five percent of patients had a personal history and 38% had a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight percent of patients had a personal history and 54% had a family history of extracolonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Phenotype analysis identified 3 patterns: relatively few large, right-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (n = 55), many small left-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (n = 18), and a combination of both left- and right-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (n = 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The right-sided phenotype had more sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and tended to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at a younger age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are at least 3 different but overlapping clinical phenotypes within hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recognizing this clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is important in defining underlying genetic causes </plain></SENT>
