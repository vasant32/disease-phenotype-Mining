<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Significant differences exist in the immunological response to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This raises the possibility that gender differences exist concerning the outcome after curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To study this hypothesis, a database of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was analysed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some 894 patients were included, 500 (55.9 per cent) were men and 394 (44.1 per cent) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 54.5 months for the entire group and 63.3 months for survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean(s.e.m.) patient age was 65.3(0.4) years (women 66.1(0.6), men 64.7(0.5) years; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women lived significantly longer after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> resection than men (57.8(1.5) versus 52.0(1.3) months; P &lt; 0.05, log rank 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival was significantly longer in women than in men (51.6(1.7) versus 46.0(1.4) months; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis revealed significant gender differences in Union Internacional Contra la Cancrum (UICC) stages I (n = 195, log rank 0.01) and UICC IV (n = 38, log rank 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> resection revealed significant advantages for women (log rank 0.02), while no gender differences were detected when comparing patients after resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients older than 50 years (n = 635) showed significant gender-related survival differences (log rank 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significant gender differences following curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> resection were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In women disease-free and overall survival were significantly longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whether or not these gender differences are related to gender-specific immune functions or to other gender-related local or systemic factors remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
