<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies showed either loss or reduction of the WWOX expression in variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, including breast, ovary, liver, stomach and pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent study demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients exhibiting higher WWOX expression showed significantly longer disease-free survival in contrast to the group with lower relative WWOX level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This work was undertaken to show whether similar phenomena take place in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumours</z:e> and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the correlation of WWOX gene expression with prognosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> in 99 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, we performed qRT-PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also performed analysis of WWOX promoter methylation status using MethylScreen method and analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) status at two WWOX-related loci, previously shown to be frequently deleted in various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly better disease-free survival was observed among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> exhibiting high level of WWOX (hazard ratio = 0.39; p = 0.0452; Mantel-Cox log-rank test), but in multivariate analysis it was not an independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that although in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> WWOX expression varies among patients and correlates with DFS, the exact mode of decrease in this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We failed to find the evidence of LOH in WWOX region, or hypermethylation in promoter regions of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although we provide the evidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-suppressive role of WWOX gene expression in colon, we were unable to identify the molecular mechanism responsible for this </plain></SENT>
