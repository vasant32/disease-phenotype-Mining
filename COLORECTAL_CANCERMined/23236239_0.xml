<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two irinotecan- and fluorouracil-based regimens, FOLFIRI and IFL, were selected as second-line therapy for 138 Chinese mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 and TS gene polymorphisms were determined by direct sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene polymorphisms of UGT1A1*28, UGT1A1*6 and promoter enhancer region of TS were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between genetic polymorphisms and clinical outcome, that is, response, toxicity and survival were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed in a subgroup patients based on different UGT1A1 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentration of irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 and inactive metabolite SN-38G were determined by high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in irinotecan and its metabolites between UGT1A1 gene variants were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients received the FOLFIRI regimen, 29 the IFL regimen, and one irinotecan monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty patients were eligible for toxicity and 111 for efficacy evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-six patients were tested for UGT1A1*28 and *6 genotypes and 125 for promoter enhancer region of TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients showed a higher frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> UGT1A1*28 (TA6/6) compared with a Caucasian population (69.9% vs 45.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between response rates and UGT1A1 genotype, although <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> showed lower response rates compared with other variants (17.9% vs 24.2% for UGT1A1*28, 15.7% vs 26.8% for UGT1A1*6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When TS was considered, the subgroup with homozygous UGT1A1*28 (TA7/7) and non-3RG genotypes showed the highest response rate (33.3%), while <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> UGT1A1*28 (TA6/6) with non-3RG only had a 13.6% response rate, but no significant difference was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression showed treatment duration was closely linked to clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In toxicity comparison, UGT1A1*28 TA6/6 was associated with lower incidence of grade 2-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (27.8% vs 100%), and significantly reduced the risk of grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> compared with TA7/7 (7.8% vs 37.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> UGT1A1*6 (G/G) tended to have a lower incidence of grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> vs homozygous mutant (A/A) genotype (13.0% vs 40.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Taking UGT1A1 and TS genotypes together, lower incidence of grade 2-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> was found in patients with non-3RG TS genotypes, when TA6/6 was compared with TA7/7 (35.3% vs 100.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>No significant association with time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and overall survival (OS) was observed with either UGT1A1 or TS gene polymorphisms, although slightly longer <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and OS were found with UGT1A1*28 (TA6/6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan PK was investigated in 34 patients, which showed high area under concentration curve (AUC) of irinotecan and SN-38, but low AUC ratio (SN-38G / SN-38) in those patients with UGT1A1*28 TA7/7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A distinct distribution pattern of UGT1A1 genotypes in Chinese patients might contribute to relatively low toxicity associated with irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> in mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
