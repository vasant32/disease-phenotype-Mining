<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> gene expression profiles were collected from 119 patients undergoing surgery for their CRLM in the Paul Brousse Hospital (France) and the University Medical Center Utrecht (The Netherlands) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into high and low risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A randomly selected training set was used to find predictive gene signatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of these gene signatures to predict DFS was tested in an independent validation set comprising the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 5 known clinical risk scores were tested in our complete patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: No gene signature was found that significantly predicted DFS in the validation set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, three out of five clinical risk scores were able to predict DFS in our patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No gene signature was found that could predict DFS in patients undergoing CRLM resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three out of five clinical risk scores were able to predict DFS in our patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results emphasize the need for validating risk scores in independent patient groups and suggest improved designs for future studies </plain></SENT>
