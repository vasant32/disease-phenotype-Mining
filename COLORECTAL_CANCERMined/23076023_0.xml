<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the impact of adjuvant systemic therapy with modern chemotherapy combinations on survival outcomes in patients with resected liver-confined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, and whether addition of bevacizumab (BEV) provides further benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 229 consecutive patients who underwent resection for liver-confined colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 229 patients, 204 who received chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine-based (n = 27), irinotecan-based (n = 84) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based (n = 93) combinations were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these, 87 patients received BEV while 117 did not (NoBEV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 27 months after metastasectomy, the median recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and overall survival (OS) were 17 and 53 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OS rates at 3 and 5 years were 71% and 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (p = 0.744) and OS (p = 0.440) among different chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (p = 0.375) and OS (p = 0.251) were similar in BEV and NoBEV arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, having 4 liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was the only negative independent factor on both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and OS, while positive surgical margin was another negative independent factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy type and addition of BEV have no impact on both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and OS in the adjuvant setting following complete resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
