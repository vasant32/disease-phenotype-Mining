<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine were randomly assigned to the pure chemotherapy group (as the control group) and the QM + chemotherapy group (as the treatment group), 60 in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received FOLFOX4 or XELOX regimen for totally 6 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the treatment group took QM 150 mL at the end of chemotherapy, once in the morning and once in the evening for 7 successive days, totally 6 therapeutic courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total and average dosages of using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes of white blood cell (WBC) counts were determined before chemotherapy and after the 6th chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT) counts were observed before chemotherapy, before the 4th chemotheray, and after the 6th chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms integrals (<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, liability to catch cold, aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>, pharyngalgia, pale complexion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004396'>poor appetite</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, and so on) and the safety indicators (the functions of the liver and kidney, urine routines) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The grading toxic and adverse reactions, KPS scoring, body weight, and the efficacy of the symptoms integrals were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the treatment period the total and average dosages of G-CSF used were larger in the control group than in the treatment group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After treatment the WBC count of the two groups were reduced with statistical difference (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The WBC counts were higher in the treatment group than in the control group in the whole therapeutic process except the first chemotherapy (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with before treatment in the same group, RBC and PLT were reduced in the two groups before the 4th chemotherapy, RBC, Hb, and PLT were reduced after treatment (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Better effects on body weight were obtained in the treatment group than in the control group with statistical difference (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, the clinical symptoms integrals such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, liability to catch cold, pharyngalgia, pale complexion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004396'>poor appetite</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> were reduced (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, the toxic and adverse reactions were reduced in the treatment group before the 4th chemotherapy (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: QM could effectively intervene chemotherapy induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It was a safe Chinese medicine compound with lower toxicity </plain></SENT>
