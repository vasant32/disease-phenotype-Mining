<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate of persons with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (mCRC) is only 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the recognition of vascularity as an important factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> proliferation and growth, targeting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> pathways has been a major focus of research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of bevacizumab, an inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, to cytotoxic chemotherapy has improved response rates and survival of patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aflibercept, a potent new multiple angiogenic factor trap that prevents not only VEGF-A but also VEGF-B and placental growth factor from activating their native receptors, has demonstrated efficacy in previously treated patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase I/II clinical trials and, more recently, a phase III clinical trial, have demonstrated effective antiangiogenic and cytotoxic activity with acceptable safety and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As is the case with bevacizumab, the optimal use of aflibercept requires appropriate management of the associated anti-VEGF adverse events and those associated with its use in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These adverse events have previously been observed and are generally manageable with appropriate therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
