<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Some studies suggest a higher case fatality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in psychiatric patients even though the incidence is no greater than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this finding is not universal and may be confounded by study design (for example, inception, compared with historical, cohort), mean cohort age, or delays in presentation with more advanced staging at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed how study design and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage at presentation affected outcomes in psychiatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective historical cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> presentations was used comparing psychiatric patients with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Psychiatric status was defined by either health service use or psychotropic prescription, and outcomes by logistic or Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 3501 new presentations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 2001 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Psychiatric cases, as defined by in- or outpatient contacts, made up 15.9% (n = 558) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association between psychiatric status and stage at presentation, surgical intervention, or mortality after adjusting for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a reduced likelihood of resection, an indicator of curative treatment, when on a selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitor or <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (n = 194; AOR 0.54; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.97) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (n = 28; AOR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association between psychiatric status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may vary by study design and how psychiatric status is defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These factors should be considered when interpreting any association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental illness</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As in studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiac mortality, historical cohorts of prevalent psychiatric cases may be less sensitive than inception cohorts of new patients, possibly because the excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> is greatest within 7 years of initial presentation for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
