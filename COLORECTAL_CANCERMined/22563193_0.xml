<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 150 patients 100 were treated with cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC and retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and postoperative follow-up data were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI), age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> index (PCI) were chosen as selection criteria with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free survival and perioperative morbidity for this multimodal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> with HIPEC was successfully performed in 100 out of 150 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients were excluded because of intraoperative contraindication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median PCI was 17 (1-39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 89% a radical resection (CC0/CC1) was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died postoperatively due to multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither PCI, age nor BMI was a risk factor for postoperative complications/outcome according to the DINDO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 9% Re-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> with HIPEC was performed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patient selection remains the most important issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither PCI, age nor BMI alone should be an exclusion criterion for this multimodal therapy </plain></SENT>
