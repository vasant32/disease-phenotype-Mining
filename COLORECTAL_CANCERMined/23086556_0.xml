<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>African Americans have a higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) mortality than other racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disparity is alarming given that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is largely preventable through the use of endoscopy (screening colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy), yet rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among African Americans is suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 48.9% of African Americans are screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> through endoscopy or fecal occult blood testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As such, researchers have focused their efforts on the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> through patient navigation (PN) services for colonoscopy screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although PN has been successful in increasing colonoscopy screening rates, screening rates of navigated participants could still be improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of this exploratory study was to understand why patients, who received PN services, did not complete a colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen participants were interviewed to identify salient themes related to noncompletion of the colonoscopy procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major themes identified included the following: a lack of knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; fear/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> about the procedure, including unknown expectations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233702" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of pain</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233705" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of cancer</z:e> diagnosis; inadequate physician communication about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the colonoscopy exam; and believing that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants felt that greater communication and explanation from their physician might help allay their fears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest that a universal approach to PN, even within culturally targeted interventions, may not be appropriate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future interventions should consider gender-specific navigation and combining PN with nonmedical interventions to address other identified barriers </plain></SENT>
