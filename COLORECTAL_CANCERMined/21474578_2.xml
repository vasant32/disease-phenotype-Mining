<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was to investigate the clinicopathologic significance and potential role of HOXB7 in the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The relationship between HOXB7 expression and clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was analyzed in 224 paraffin-embedded archived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens by immunohistochemistry (IHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of HOXB7 on cell growth and proliferation, as well as on <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, were examined both in vitro and in vivo, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, colony formation assay, cell cycle analysis, soft agar assay, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR were performed to examine the impact of HOXB7 on the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HOXB7 protein level was significantly correlated with advanced Dukes stage (P &lt; 0.001), T stage (P = 0.012), distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P = 0.042), higher proliferation index (P = 0.007) and poor survival of patients (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enforced expression of HOXB7 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines significantly enhanced cell growth, proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, knockdown of HOXB7 caused an inhibition of cell growth, proliferation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also showed that HOXB7 accelerated G(0)-G(1) to S-phase transition concomitantly with upregulation of cyclin D1 and downregulation of p27Kip1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, knockdown of HOXB7 caused G(1)-S-phase arrest, downregulation of cyclin D1 and upregulation of p27Kip1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enforced expression of HOXB7 could enhance PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HOXB7 protein, as a valuable marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis, plays an important role in the development and progression of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
