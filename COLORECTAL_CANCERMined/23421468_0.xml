<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Significance: Adequate and supranutritional <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> (Se) intake, maintaining full expression of selenoproteins, has been assumed to be beneficial for human health with respect to prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, the effectiveness of dietary Se supplementation depends on many factors: baseline Se status, age, gender, and genetic background of an individual; type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>; and time point of intervention in addition to metabolic conversion and dose of applied Se compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent Advances: Se intake levels for optimization of plasma selenoproteins in humans have been delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regulation, function, and genetic variants of several selenoproteins have been characterized in the intestine, where Se-mediated prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> appears to be particularly promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Critical Issues: Numerous cell culture and animal studies indicate anticarcinogenic capacity of various Se compounds but, at present, the outcome of human studies is inconsistent and, in large part, disappointing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, supranutritional Se intake may even trigger adverse health effects, possibly increasing the risk for Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Se-replete populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future Directions: To improve protocols for the use of Se in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention, knowledge on cellular and systemic actions of Se compounds needs to be broadened and linked to individual-related determinants such as the occurrence of variants in selenoprotein genes and the Se status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on better mechanistic insight, populations and individuals that may benefit most from dietary Se supplementation need to be defined and studied in suitably planned intervention trials </plain></SENT>
