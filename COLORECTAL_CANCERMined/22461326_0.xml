<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent report detailed the occurrence of both somatic and constitutional variants in the GALNT12 gene, located at 9q22.33, in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigate the occurrence of inherited deleterious variants in GALNT12 in 118 families referred to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genetics clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discovered two deleterious variants (c.907G&gt;A (p.Asp303Asn); c.1187A&gt;G (p.Tyr396Cys)) in 4/118 probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variants, which were not found in 149 control individuals (P = 0.0376), cosegregate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in other family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability by chance that cosegregation of c.907G&gt;A with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> occurred, in the two pedigrees combined, was 1.56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although this study does not provide irrefutable evidence that GALNT12 variants are highly penetrant alleles that predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the majority of unexplained hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> families, it does provide additional evidence to support an important role of these variants in a proportion of this considerable high-risk group </plain></SENT>
