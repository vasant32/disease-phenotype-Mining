<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with mCRC who progressed or relapsed after first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based or irinotecan-based treatment received bevacizumab 2.5 mg/kg/week plus chemotherapy until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was disease-control rate (DCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (66% men; median age, 62 years old) received second-line bevacizumab plus folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; 57%), folinic acid, fluorouracil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX; 26%), irinotecan (15%), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus irinotecan (XELIRI; 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DCR was 87% (95% CI, 77%-97%); ORR was 32% (95% CI, 19%-46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.8-7.8 months) and median OS 19.3 months, (95% CI, 14.2-25.1 months).The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (21%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (15%), asthenia, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (9% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients (9%) had grade 3/4 targeted toxicities: grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 2), grade 3 venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (n = 2), and grade 4 arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these events led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab plus standard second-line chemotherapy is highly active in patients with mCRC and has an acceptable safety profile </plain></SENT>
