<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the identification of a number of common susceptibility loci for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>); however, none of these GWAS have considered gene-environment (G × E) interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is unclear whether current hits are modified by environmental exposures or whether there are additional hits whose effects are dependent on environmental exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for G × E interactions using genome wide data from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> Family Registry that included 1,191 cases of microsatellite stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) or microsatellite instability-low (MSI-L) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 999 controls genotyped using either the Illumina Human1M or Human1M-Duo BeadChip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested for interactions between genotypes and 14 environmental factors using 3 methods: a traditional case-control test, a case-only test, and the recently proposed 2-step method by Murcray and colleagues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> potentially significant findings were replicated in the ARCTIC Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No G × E interactions were identified that reached genome-wide significance by any of the 3 methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When analyzing previously reported susceptibility loci, 7 significant G × E interactions were found at a 5% significance level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We investigated these 7 interactions in an independent sample and none of the interactions were replicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Identifying G × E interactions will present challenges in a GWAS setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our power calculations illustrate the need for larger sample sizes; however, as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease, a tradeoff between increasing sample size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> needs to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: The results from this first genome-wide analysis of G × E in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> identify several challenges, which may be addressed by large consortium efforts </plain></SENT>
