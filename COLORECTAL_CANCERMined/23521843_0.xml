<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well known that prognosis worsens with higher pN classification, and several recent studies propose superiority of the lymph node ratio (ln ratio) to the TNM system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared the prognosis of ln ratio to TNM system in our stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 939 patients underwent radical surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 2000 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From this pool of patients, 142 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> stage III patients were identified and taken for this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using martingale residuals, this cohort could be separated into a group with a low ln ratio and one with a high ln ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These groups were compared to pN1 and pN2 of the TNM system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For ln ratio, the cutoff was calculated at 0.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a good prognosis of disease-free and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related survival for the N-category of the TNM system as well as for the lymph node ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between using the N-category of the TNM system and the ln ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There might not be a benefit in using the lymph node ratio rather than the N category of the TNM system as long as the number of subgroups is not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our consideration, there is no need to change the N categorization of the TNM system to the ln ratio </plain></SENT>
