<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> (PLF) is the most feared and severe complication after extensive liver resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present an innovative surgical technique that has been employed for the treatment of three patients (two with multiple colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and one with hilar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath>) whose livers were previously considered locally unresectable because of an insufficient future liver remnant (FLR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In-situ liver transection with right portal vein ligation was implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six days after surgery a volumetric computed tomography (CT)-scan showed 40-80% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the FLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients then underwent a completion surgery with right hepatectomy or right trisectionectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed PLF during a mean hospital stay of 16 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of two months, the three of them are free of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This technique induced rapid growth of the FLR, greater than that reported with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein occlusion</z:e> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It represents a promising advance in oncological liver surgery that readdresses the current management of patients with primarily unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such a revolutionary strategy allows a two-stage surgical approach during a single hospital stay and without PLF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, further research is needed to determine the long-term outcomes of this technique and to explain the occurrence of such <z:mp ids='MP_0005516'>enhanced liver regeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
