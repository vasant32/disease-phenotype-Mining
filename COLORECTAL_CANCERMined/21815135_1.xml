<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analysis of the Singapore Chinese Health Study included 51,251 men and women aged 45-74 years enrolled in 1993-1998 and followed through 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among cohort members were identified through record linkage, and 980 cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox regression models were used to investigate the association of baseline BMI with risk of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during a mean of 11.5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant, U-shaped, quadratic association was observed between BMI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk, with increased risk in BMIs ≥27.5 and &lt;18.5 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association was more pronounced in never smokers and most prominent when further limiting the sample to those free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and cases with longer than 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Localized cases had a more pronounced association in BMIs ≥27.5, whereas advanced cases had a more pronounced association in BMIs &lt;18.5 kg/m(2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was found in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association was also stronger among patients aged 65 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMI displays a U-shaped, quadratic association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk in this Chinese population in Southeast Asia </plain></SENT>
