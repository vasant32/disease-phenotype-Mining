<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether goals were a salient concept during the period immediately following treatment, and whether a goal-setting intervention might be feasible and acceptable to these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Method: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were administered to a convenience sample of 41 CRC patients who were 0-24 months post-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Topics discussed included expectations and goals for future health, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention awareness, health-promoting behavior-change goals, and post-treatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> issues </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Overall, participants' health-related goals were: being healthy, getting back to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and not having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors reported being proactive with their health by maintaining healthy behaviors or making healthy behavior changes, or had goals to change their behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> respondents had plans to maintain follow-up care and regular screening appointments </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many respondents were satisfied with the care they received, and felt it was now their responsibility to do their part in taking care of themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significance of results: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors talk about goals, and many of them are either making or have an interest in making health behavior changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Self-management support could be an appropriate strategy to assist patients with achieving their health goals post-treatment </plain></SENT>
