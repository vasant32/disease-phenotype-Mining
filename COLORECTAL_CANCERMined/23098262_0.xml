<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">Non-small cell lung cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are commonly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed with early-stage non-small cell lung, breast, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> represent potentially curable populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For these patients, surgery is the primary mode of treatment, with (neo)adjuvant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy) recommended according to disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from our research in Nova Scotia, as well as others', demonstrate that a substantial proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, for whom practice guidelines recommend (neo)adjuvant therapy, are not referred for an oncologist consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, surveillance data and clinical experience suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients have much higher referral rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since surgery is the primary treatment, the surgeon plays a major role in referring patients to oncologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, an improved understanding of how surgeons make decisions related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> services is important to developing strategies to optimize referral rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Few studies have examined decision making for (neo)adjuvant therapy from the perspective of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study will use qualitative methods to examine decision-making processes related to referral to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> services for individuals diagnosed with potentially curable non-small cell lung, breast, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A qualitative study will be conducted, guided by the principles of grounded theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study design is informed by our ongoing research, as well as a model of access to health services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The method of data collection will be in-depth, semi structured interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We will attempt to recruit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lung, breast, and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgeons in Nova Scotia (n ≈ 42), with the aim of interviewing a minimum of 34 surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Data will be collected and analyzed concurrently, with two investigators independently coding and analyzing the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Analysis will involve an inductive, grounded approach using constant comparative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The primary outcomes will be (1) identification of the patient, surgeon, institutional, and health-system factors that influence surgeons' decisions to refer non-small cell lung, breast, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> services when consideration for (neo)adjuvant therapy is recommended and (2) identification of potential strategies that could optimize referral to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> for appropriate individuals </plain></SENT>
