<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the functions of a medical oncologist and the time recommended for each work activity established by the Spanish Society of Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> (SEOM), we carried out a pilot study on the three most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> in our country [<z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (BC), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (LC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>)], in order to determine the real time each patient requires from a physician and thus establish a recommendation on the number of medical oncologists necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the actual itinerary of the first 20 patients of 2009 in each of the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> seen at the Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Service of the Virgen de Valme University Hospital, we measured the number of visits, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> treatments received, the number of hospital admissions and average length of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the years following the study, these data were estimated based on the natural history of each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first year, the average time spent by the medical oncologist was 235, 390 and 265 min on each outpatient with BC, LC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In hospitalisation, the average oncologist/patient minutes were 40, 360 and 118 for BC, LC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the time spent on each visit or day of hospitalisation was that recommended by the SEOM, achieving an ultimate ratio of 1 oncologist for every 83 first visits </plain></SENT>
