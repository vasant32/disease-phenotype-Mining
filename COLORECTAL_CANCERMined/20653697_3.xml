<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is argued that the risk of incomplete resection could be higher than in open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, difficulty in dissection could lead to a very high rate of conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is little information on this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study aimed at assessing feasibility and operative and oncologic results of laparoscopic resection for T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between 2006 and 2009, 39 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with suspected involvement of another organ (T4) on computed tomography scanning and/or magnetic resonance imaging were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were in the right colon (n = 18), left colon (n =9) and rectum (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of possible organ involvement was abdominal or pelvic side-wall (n = 21), urinary bladder (n = 4), small bowel or colon (n = 6), vagina and ovary (n = 3), prostate or seminal vesicles (n = 3) and duodenum (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall conversion rate was 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality and morbidity were 2.5 and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical anastomotic leakage rate was 15% (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abdominal reoperation was required in three (7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pathological invasion to other organs (pT4) was confirmed in 30 (77%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The R1 resection rate was 13% (4 of 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After a median follow up of 19 months (range 1.5-45 months), the overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 97 and 89%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that laparoscopic surgery is feasible for colorectal T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopy cannot therefore be considered an absolute contraindication for T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
