<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our aims were to determine clinical factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening and to evaluate the relative role of patient contact with physicians and the quality of these patient-physician interactions in affecting screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Screening-eligible patients were identified from the Health Information National Trends Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Determinants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were assessed with logistic regression, and a joint effects model that considered the frequency and quality of contact with physicians was developed to explore their influence on screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 4,615 respondents of whom only 66% reported receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Older age, personal history of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, family history of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, high-income earners, individuals who visited their physicians ≥5 times per year, and those who rated the interactions with their physicians highly were more likely to be screened (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The joint effects model revealed that quality rather than frequency of physician contact was a stronger predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, but the odds of screening was highest for those who experienced both frequent and high-quality interactions with their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contact with physicians and the quality of this interaction are associated with screening behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interventions to improve these provider-related factors may promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
