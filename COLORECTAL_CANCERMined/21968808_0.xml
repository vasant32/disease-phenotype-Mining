<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We made a prospective study of the efficacy and toxicities of cetuximab-combination first-line (FOLFOX4) versus second/third-line (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy in 98 KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> KRAS had been identified by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations between clinical response/progression-free survival/overall survival/toxicities and cetuximab-combination chemotherapy timing were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was significantly higher for first-line treatment than for second/third-line treatment (relative risk = 1.707, 95% confidence interval = 1.121-2.598) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both progression-free survival and overall survival indicated significantly longer survival of first-line treatment than second/third-line treatment patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study is a validation of a molecular analysis of KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> status for the prediction of response to cetuximab-combination chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients; its predictive role was less prominent in the second/third-line than in the first-line treatment patients </plain></SENT>
