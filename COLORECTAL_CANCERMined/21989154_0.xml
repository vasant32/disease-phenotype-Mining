<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare different survival endpoints in patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and to understand the effect of second primary other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> on disease-free survival (DFS) calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based cohort of 415 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 332 of whom were treated with curative intention between the years 2000-2003, was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Events such as locoregional recurrence, distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary cancers</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and loss to follow-up were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different survival endpoints, including DFS, overall survival, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival, relapse-free survival, time to treatment failure and time to recurrence were compared and DFS was calculated with and without inclusion of second primary other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The events that occurred most often in patients treated with curative intention were non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n = 74), distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (n = 66) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n = 59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DFS was the survival endpoint with most events (n = 170) followed by overall survival (n = 144) and relapse-free survival (n = 139) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fewer events were seen for time to treatment failure (n = 80), time to recurrence (n = 68) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (n = 59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Second primary other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> occurred in 26 patients and its inclusion as an event in DFS calculations had a detrimental effect on the survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DFS for patients with stage I-III disease was 62% after 5 years if second primary other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was not included as an event, compared with 58% if it was </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the difference was larger for stage II (68 vs 60%) than for stage III (49 vs 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of second primary other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as an endpoint in DFS analyses significantly alters the DFS for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Researchers and journals must clearly define survival endpoints in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trial protocols and published manuscripts </plain></SENT>
