<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 96 patients (40 female, 56 male; mean age, 60.6 Â± 12 years) with a previous diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT on suspicion of recurrence and were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were accepted as the presence of increased serum CEA levels or positive findings on abdominal ceCT or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT findings were compared with histopathological findings and/or clinical follow-up data as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups: group 1, with increased CEA levels and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> abdominal ceCT; group 2, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CEA levels and positive ceCT; and group 3, with increased CEA levels and positive ceCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whereas sensitivities of CEA, ceCT, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT in the three patient groups were calculated as 91, 67, and 96%, specificities were 13, 51, and 62%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 35, 14, and 46 patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In separate analyses conducted on the groups, sensitivity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT was computed as 100 and 100% and specificity as 88 and 80% for groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 3, which comprised four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary malignancies</z:e>, sensitivity and specificity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT were 94 and 16%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT has an additional role in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence with a higher sensitivity compared with CEA and ceCT alone, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT is especially more successful in patients with isolated elevated CEA levels or positive ceCT findings without accompanying CEA elevation </plain></SENT>
