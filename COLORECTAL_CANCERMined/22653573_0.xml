<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: In April 2010, publication of the UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy (FS) Trial results generated considerable media interest in both FS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) generally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used routinely collected data from the south of England (excluding London) to analyse return of faecal occult blood test (FOBt) kits within 28 days of the invitation (early uptake) among 60-69 year olds, before (T1, n = 31,229), around the time of (T2, n = 39,571), and one month after (T3, n = 33,430) the FS publicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FOBt uptake over the whole period was 58.2%, with 38.4% of the kits returned within 28 days (early uptake) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Across the three time periods, early uptake was 35.8% at T1, 39.4% at T2, and 39.7% at T3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression controlling for age, gender and socioeconomic status confirmed that uptake was higher if people received the FOBt kit around the time of the media coverage (T2: odds ratio [OR] = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.13-1.20), or one month after (T3: OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.15-1.22) than before (T1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sub-group analyses demonstrated that the impact was stronger among previous non-responders than among first-time invitees or previous responders (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Media coverage of the FS Trial appeared to have a small but positive impact on FOBt screening uptake, especially among people who had previously abstained from screening </plain></SENT>
