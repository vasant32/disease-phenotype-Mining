<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activating KRAS mutations have been reported in 30-60% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and an inverse correlation between Kras and miR-143/145 expression has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have demonstrated that oncogenic Kras leads to repression of the miR-143/145 cluster in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> and is dependent on the Ras responsive element (RRE) binding protein (RREB1), which negatively regulates miR-143/145 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have found that RREB1 is overexpressed in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and cell lines, and the expression of the miR-143/145 primary transcript is inversely related to RREB1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines, the miR-143/145 cluster is repressed by RREB1 downstream of constitutively active KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RREB1 is activated by the MAPK pathway and negatively represses the miR-143/145 promoter through interaction with two RREs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, overexpression of miR-143 or miR-145 in HCT116 cells abrogates signaling through the MAPK, PI3K and JNK pathways by downregulation of both KRAS and RREB1 in addition to downregulation of a cohort of genes in the MAPK signaling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results establish a complex network of regulation through which the miR-143/145 cluster is able to modulate KRAS signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>.Oncogene advance online publication, 2 July 2012; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.266 </plain></SENT>
