<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: To elucidate the survival benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy by decreasing incidence or by delaying time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence, we reported the long-term results of a nonrandomized prospective study comparing the adjuvant chemotherapy to no chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: From 1991 to 1995, 463 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> were divided to three groups which were no chemotherapy, weekly chemotherapy, and monthly chemotherapy (5-FU plus levamisole) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The recurrent incidence was significantly decreased in patients with chemotherapy (47.8% vs. 63.9% of no chemotherapy, P = 0.001), resulting into better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific and overall survival rates of patients with chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy were 52.1% vs. 37.8% and 46.9% vs. 29.9%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weekly chemotherapy had better survival than monthly chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in recurrent time or types between the patients with and without chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentages of patients with recurrence happened within 3 years were 85.2% and 84.6% of those with and without chemotherapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with advanced stage of T4b invasion depth, N2, and central node invasion had no significant survival benefits by adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival benefits achieved by adjuvant chemotherapy is through decreasing recurrent incidence, not through postponing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrent time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>That means adjuvant chemotherapy indeed cures some patients by eradicating occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In adjuvant setting, more powerful regimen for eradicating occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is the keystone to improve long-term survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
