<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To undertake an initial assessment of the potential utility of dynamic contrast-enhanced texture analysis (DCE-TA) of the liver in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: TA comprised measurement of mean gray-level intensity, entropy, and uniformity with and without selective-scale filtration using a band-pass filter to highlight different spatial frequencies reflecting fine, medium, and coarse textures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An initial phantom study assessed the sensitivity of each texture qualifier to computed tomography (CT) acquisition parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Texture was analyzed in DCE-CT series from 27 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients having apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hepatic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (node-negative: n = 8, node-positive: n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Averaged changes in hepatic texture induced by contrast material were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by using kinetic modeling to calculate hepatic perfusion indices following fine, medium, and coarse image filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> texture qualifiers were less sensitive to changes in CT acquisition parameters than measurement of CT attenuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Temporal changes in hepatic texture were qualitatively different from changes in enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences between node-negative and node-positive patients were observed for at least 1 time period for measurements of hepatic enhancement and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> texture parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences were most statistically significant and occurred over the greatest number of time periods for fine texture quantified as mean gray-level intensity (5 time periods, minimum P value: 0.006) followed by fine texture quantified as entropy (4 time points, minimum P value: 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in hepatic perfusion indices for the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DCE-TA is a potentially useful adjunct to DCE-CT warranting further investigation </plain></SENT>
