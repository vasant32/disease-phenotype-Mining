<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we derived a gene signature for colorectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> defined by high Wnt signaling activity, which in agreement with previous observations predicts poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, however, we found that elevated expression of Wnt targets was actually associated with good prognosis, while patient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with low expression of Wnt target genes segregated with immature stem cell signatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We discovered that several Wnt target genes, including ASCL2 and LGR5, become silenced by CpG island methylation during progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, and that their re-expression was associated with reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data show that promoter methylation of Wnt target genes is a strong predictor for recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and suggest that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> gene signatures, rather than reflecting <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> numbers, may reflect differentiation status of the malignant tissue </plain></SENT>
