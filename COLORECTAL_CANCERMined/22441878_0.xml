<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine whether body mass index is associated with reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening in a large population of black and white adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional data collected at baseline for 9,547 black men, 14,515 black women, 3,519 white men, and 7,245 white women aged 50-79 enrolled in the Southern Community Cohort Study from 2002 to 2009 were used to examine odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the use of colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy in relation to body mass index (BMI) categories (&lt;18.5, 18.5-24.9 (referent), 25-29.9, 30-34.9, 35-39.9, and 40+ (extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>), kg/m(2)) using logistic regression controlling for age, education, income, health insurance status, last physician visit, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>Increased BMI</z:mp> was not associated with reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among whites (OR (95 % CI) for BMI ≥ 40 = 1.02 (0.71-1.46) for white men and 0.99 (0.83-1.19) for white women), and odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were increased with high BMI among blacks (OR (95 % CI) for BMI ≥ 40 = 1.34 (1.03-1.74) for black men and 1.13 (0.98-1.29) for black women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was associated with reduced odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening only among white women in subgroup analyses limited to those with health insurance or income ≥$25,000/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated BMI was not a deterrent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening overall in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In light of low overall screening rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> nationally, efforts to increase screening in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals should remain the focus of public health initiatives </plain></SENT>
