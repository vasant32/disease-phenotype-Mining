<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FOLFOX4 has shown its efficacy in pivotal trials, but patients must make twice-weekly hospital visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FOLFOX6 is a more convenient regimen, requiring a visit once every two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of FOLFOX6 in Japanese patients with pretreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fifty-one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who failed to respond to first-line chemotherapy were enrolled in the study from April to July 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and l-leucovorin were administered every two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (100 mg/m(2)) and l-leucovorin (200 mg/m(2)) were given intravenously over 2 h followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> bolus 400 mg/m(2) i.v. and 46-h infusion of 2400 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients had no measurable lesions and were excluded from the efficacy analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 49 eligible patients, one complete response and 6 partial responses were observed, resulting in a response rate (RR) of 14.3% (95% confidence interval: 5.9-27.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median time to treatment failure and progression-free survival was 4.4 and 5.3 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 11.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade 2/3 (Debiopharm neurotoxicity criteria) <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> was 41.2%, whereas the overall incidence of grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was 43.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that FOLFOX6 had an acceptable profile in terms of both efficacy and safety in previously treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
