<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preventive Services Task Force advocates use of a 5A's framework (assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange) for preventive health recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe 5A content of patient-physician <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening discussions and physician-recommended screening modality and to test if these vary by whether patient previously received screening recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Direct observation of periodic health examinations in 2007-2009 among average-risk primary care patients aged 50-80 years due for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitative content analyses conducted 2008-2010 used to code office visit audio-recordings for 5A and other discussion content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among study-eligible visits (N=415), 59% contained assistance (i.e., help scheduling colonoscopy or delivery of stool cards), but the assess, advise, and agree steps were rarely comprehensively provided (1%-21%), and only 3% included the last step, arrange follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> physicians endorsed screening via colonoscopy (99%), either alone (69%) or in combination with other tests (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients nonadherent to a prior physician screening recommendation (31%) were less likely to have the reason(s) for screening discussed (37% vs 65%) or be told the endoscopy clinic would call them for scheduling (19% vs 27%), and more likely to have fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) alone (34% vs 25%) or FOBT and colonoscopy recommended (24% vs 14%), and a screening plan negotiated (21% vs 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significance level is p&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contrasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients due for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discuss screening with their physician, but with limited application of the 5A's approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Opportunities to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening decision-making are great, particularly among patients who are nonadherent to a prior recommendation from a physician </plain></SENT>
