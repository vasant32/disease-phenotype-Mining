<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with CC were syndrome typed as dampness-heat accumulation syndrome, qi stagnation with blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005750" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stasis syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>-Shen yang deficiency syndrome, and Gan-Shen yin deficiency syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene polymorphisms of excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) C8092A and C19007T in different CM syndrome types of CC were examined by polymorphisms chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing, and analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of C8092A genotype and allele in different CM syndrome types had no statistical difference (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of C19007T genotype and allele in different CM syndrome types had statistical difference (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of them, there was no statistical difference in the frequencies between dampness-heat accumulation syndrome and qi stagnation with blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005750" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stasis syndrome</z:e>, or between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>-Shen yang deficiency syndrome and Gan-Shen yin deficiency syndrome (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was statistical difference between dampness-heat accumulation syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>-Shen yang deficiency syndrome as well as Gan-Shen yin deficiency syndrome (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was statistical difference between qi stagnation with blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005750" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stasis syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>-Shen yang deficiency syndrome as well as Gan-Shen yin deficiency syndrome (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ERCC1 C19007T gene polymorphisms might be associated with CM syndrome types of CC, which needed to be further studied </plain></SENT>
