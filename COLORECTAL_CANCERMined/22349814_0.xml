<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17408">monoglyceride</z:chebi> lipase (MGL) is a recently identified lipase and very little is known about its regulation and function in cellular regulatory processes, particularly in context to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the regulation and function of MGL in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>(s) and report that MGL expression was either absent or reduced in the majority of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies showed that reduction of MGL expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> tissues predominantly occurred in the cancerous epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MGL was found to reside in the core surface of a cellular organelle named '<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> body' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was found to interact selectively with a number of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi> and phosphoinositol(3,4,5)P3, phosphoinositol(3,5)P2, phosphoinositol(3,4)P2 and several other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositides</z:chebi>, and among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositides</z:chebi> analyzed, its interaction with PI(3,4,5)P3 was found to be the strongest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, overexpression of MGL suppressed colony formation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines and knockdown of MGL resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that MGL plays a negative regulatory role in phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell growth </plain></SENT>
