<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryoablation for metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The procedures were performed on 24 patients (36-82 years of age, with a median age of 62; 17 male patients, 7 female patients) for 55 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the lung, during 30 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The procedural safety, local progression free interval, and overall survival were assessed by follow-up computed tomographic scanning performed every 3-4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The major complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, 19 sessions (63%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo>, 21 sessions (70%), transient and self-limiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo>, 13 sessions (43%) and tract seeding, 1 session (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 1- and 3-year local progression free intervals were 90.8% and 59%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-years local progression free intervals of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> ≤15 mm in diameter was 79.8% and that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> &gt;15 mm was 28.6% (p = 0.001; log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 1- and 3-year overall survival rates were 91% and 59.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicated that percutaneous cryoablation is a feasible treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The local progression free interval was satisfactory at least for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that were ≤15 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
