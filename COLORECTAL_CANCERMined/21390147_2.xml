<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive sample of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were interviewed regarding personal and family histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data and pathology features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were obtained from chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 212 CRC patients recruited, 61 (29%) reported a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 45 (21.2%) were diagnosed under age 50 years and 11 (5.2%) had more than one primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Family histories consistent with Amsterdam and revised Bethesda criteria for LS were identified in 22 (10.4%) and 100 (47.2%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty percent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> had features of the high microsatellite instability phenotype, which was associated with younger age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis and with Bethesda criteria (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
