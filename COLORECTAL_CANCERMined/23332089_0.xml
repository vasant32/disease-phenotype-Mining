<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a preliminary study, we had found expression of the leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) known as a potential marker for stem cells in the small intestine and colon in DR in liver damaged by chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to confirm LGR expression in DR in damaged liver after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods:  A total of 68 liver specimens obtained after surgical resection were stained with monoclonal antibodies for cytokeratin (CK)7, neural cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (NCAM; a bile ductular and liver progenitor cell marker), CD133 (a candidate stem cell marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and LGR5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were investigated according to the location in damaged liver after chemotherapy using microdissected specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results:  We observed that LGR5 was expressed in DR with CD133, CK7 and NCAM expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, LGR5, CD133 and NCAM were not expressed in mature bile ducts with CK7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In transcriptional analysis, LGR5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in fibrotic tissue including DR were higher compared with that in adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver without significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  These findings suggest that LGR5 may be involved in maintaining DR in damaged liver </plain></SENT>
