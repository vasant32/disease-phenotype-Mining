<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine whether the change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameters at the first follow-up computed tomography (CT) examination after baseline examination (first change) correlates with outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first change was analyzed in a multicenter randomized phase III trial (Nordic VI, N = 567) comparing first-line irinotecan with either bolus or infused <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards multiple regression model and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses after correction for guarantee-time bias were carried out to evaluate correlations between first change, objective response according to RECIST 1.0, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hazard ratios for PFS and OS decreased along with first change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decrease between 10% and &lt;30%, albeit RECIST does not regard this as a partial response, was a positive prognostic factor for PFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had new lesions or unequivocal progression of nonmeasurable lesions had a worse prognosis than those with only an increase in size of &gt;20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size at the first follow-up CT is strongly prognostic for PFS and OS in mCRC </plain></SENT>
