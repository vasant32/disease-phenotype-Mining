<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, WWTR1 has also been identified as a major component of the novel Hippo signalling pathway important for the development of breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show for the first time that WWTR1 has an oncogenic function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the decreased proliferation was due to cell cycle arrest and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, efficient knockdown of WWTR1, demonstrated by quantitative real-time PCR, led to upregulation of ASNS and downregulation of SMAD3, LTBR, BAX and BAK1 in WWTR1 knockdown cells, suggesting that these genes may be involved in the repression of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that WWTR1 is an oncogene and has an important role in the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
