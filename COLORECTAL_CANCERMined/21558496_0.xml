<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the impact of body mass index (BMI) and physical activity (PA) on mortality among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients and the results are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine the impact of these lifestyle factors on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and disease-specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Population-based longitudinal study followed 1,825 patients diagnosed with stages I to III primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during 2003 to 2004 in Queensland, Australia for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were obtained via questionnaires and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants with some level of PA following diagnosis had 25% to 28% lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality within 5 years of diagnosis than sedentary participants [insufficiently active: HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.57-0.91; sufficiently active: HR = 0.75 (0.60-0.94)]; however, the differential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mortality was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increases in PA from five to 12 months postdiagnosis was associated with reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific mortality by 32% to 36% (increase â‰¤ 2 hour per week: HR = 0.68 (0.48-0.97); increase &gt; 2 hour per week: HR = 0.64 (0.44-0.93) and 31% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (increase &gt;2 hour per week: HR = 0.69 (0.50-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with participants with healthy BMI, significant higher mortality risk was observed in underweight patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause: HR = 2.29 (1.47-3.59); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: HR = 1.74 (1.00-3.04), although lower risk in overweight (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause: HR = 0.75 (0.61-0.94); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: HR = 0.75 (0.59-0.97) and no difference in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was associated with increased mortality risk by three-fold but no difference in those who gained weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Protective effects of being physically active and increasing that activity underlines the importance of interventions to increase activity levels among people being diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Increased mortality risks associated with being underweight or having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> over time is an important indicator for which clinicians, patients, and support personnel can monitor </plain></SENT>
