<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TIM infiltration in 325 stage I to III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens was detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optimal cutpoint of TIM density was assessed by the X-tile program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TIM infiltration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was significantly higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the X-tile program, the cutpoint for high TIM infiltration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was determined when TIM density was more than 8.0 per high-power field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis between TIM density and clinicopathological variables demonstrated that TIM infiltration was significantly associated with gender, nodal status, and American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high TIM infiltration was a risk factor for both overall survival and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, high TIM infiltration can be an independent and useful biomarker for predicting the poor survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
