<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening colonoscopies have been offered in Germany since 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, validation of screening programs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> relies on estimates up to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the risk factor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suspicious symptoms on the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its precursor lesions in patients at least 55 years of age undergoing colonoscopy in comparison with an age-matched and sex-matched control population undergoing screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, controlled colonoscopy study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Integrated care program of 49 gastroenterological practices in collaboration with a health insurance company and the screening colonoscopy program in Hesse, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: In total, 1075 symptomatic and 5375 asymptomatic participants were matched for age and sex (1 : 5) from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its precursor lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was significantly equivalent in both the symptomatic (n=13/1075, 1.21%) and the control group [n=55/5375, 1.02%, 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference: [-0.46%, 0.83%], P=0.0002, equivalence test with Î´=1.5%], respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were observed in significantly fewer symptomatic patients (61/1075, 5.67%) compared with 432/5375 matched asymptomatic screening participants (8.03%, 95% CI for the difference: [-3.98%, -0.74%], P=0.0094, difference test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were found significantly less often in symptomatic patients (n=269/1075, 25.0%) than in matched screening participants (n=1807/5375, 33.6%, 95% CI for the difference: [-11.53%, -5.66%], P&lt;0.0001, difference test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results underline the importance of screening the symptom-free population at least 55 years of age to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
