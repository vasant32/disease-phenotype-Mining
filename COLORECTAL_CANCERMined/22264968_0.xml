<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using data from the U.K. fluorouracil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and CPT11 (irinotecan)--use and sequencing (FOCUS) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis adopted the perspective of the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>National Health Service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Input parameters were derived using a system of risk equations (for probabilities), count data regression models (for resource use), and generalized linear models (for utilities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parameter estimates were obtained using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, propagating the simulation values through the state-transition model to characterize appropriately the joint distributions of expected cost, survival and quality-adjusted life years for each treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An acceptability frontier was used to represent the probability that the optimal option is cost-effective at different values of the cost-effectiveness threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The base-case analysis used drug unit costs provided by a typical English hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First-line doublet therapy combination therapy fluorouracil (5FU) plus irinotecan was the most cost-effective strategy at standard thresholds, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £14,877 (pound sterling) compared with first-line 5FU until treatment failure followed by single agent irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other strategies were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subject to extended dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A sensitivity analysis using published drug (list) prices found the most cost-effective strategy would be first-line fluorouracil until failure followed by 5FU plus irinotecan (ICER: £19,753) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 5FU and irinotecan (whether used first or second line) appears to be more cost-effective than the single agent sequential therapies used in the FOCUS trial, or 5FU plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
