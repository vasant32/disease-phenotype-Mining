<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> was shown to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reports the induction of cellular senescence of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells HCT116 upon <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SA-Î²-galactosidase activation was observed both in p53+/+ and p53-/- cells, however the latter ones were less sensitive to the prosenescent activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of p53 and p21 proteins was observed in p53+/+ HCT116, while p53-independent induction of p21 was noticed in p53-/- HCT116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the senescence of HCT116 cells was accompanied by autophagy, that was confirmed by electron microscopy observations of autophagosomes in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-treated cells as well as LC3-II expression, punctue staining of LC3 and increased content of acidic vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of autophagy, due to the diminished expression of ATG5 by RNAi decreased the number of senescent cells induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>, but did not lead to increased cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, we demonstrated a new antitumor activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell senescence and revealed the presence of a functional link between senescence and autophagy in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-treated cells </plain></SENT>
