<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several protocols to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> have been developed, the incidence and number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> are not much enough for the efficient bioassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we established the very efficient system to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> with a chemically induced-colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>-prone Apc-mutant rat, Kyoto Apc Delta (KAD) rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we applied the KAD rat to the chemotherapeutic bioassay for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and showed the utility of the KAD rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The KAD rat has been developed by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">ENU</z:chebi> mutagenesis and carries a homozygous nonsense mutation in the Apc gene (S2523X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male KAD rats were given a single subcutaneous injection of AOM (20 mg/kg body weight) at 5 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Starting at 1 week after the AOM injection, they were given 2% DSS in drinking water for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>-bearing KAD rats were divided into experimental and control groups on the basis of the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> observed by endoscopy at week 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) was administrated intravenously a dose of 50 or 75 mg/kg weekly at week 9, 10, and 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After one-week interval, the 5-FU was given again at week 13, 14, and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At week 16, animals were sacrificed and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> number and volume were measured macroscopically and microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total 48 tumors were observed in 27 KAD rats with a 100% incidence at week 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The maximum tolerated dose for the KAD rat was 50 mg/kg of 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Macroscopically, the number or volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the 5-FU treated rats was not significantly different from the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the 5-FU treated rats was not significantly different (p &lt; 0.02) from that of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the volume of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> was significantly lower than in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Anticancer effect of the 5-FU could be obtained only after the 16 weeks of experimental period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of the AOM/DSS-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing KAD rats could shorten the experimental period and reduce the number of animals examined in the chemotherapeutic bioassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The efficient bioassay with the AOM/DSS-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing KAD rats would promote the development of new anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> drugs and regimens </plain></SENT>
