<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2000 to September 2011, 910 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery and 434 open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postoperative complications were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (5.3%, 48/910) in the laparoscopic group were converted to open operation, of whom 36 (75.0%, 36/48) were due to difficulty in procedure and exposure from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003275'>narrow pelvis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate was 20.3% (185/910) in the laparoscopic group and 25.3%(110/434) in the open group (χ2=4.316, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients with a diverting stoma, the anstomotic leak rate was 2.1% (3/145) and 2.2% (2/93) (χ2=0.002, P&gt;0.05), anastomotic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate was 3.4% (5/145) and 4.3% (4/93) (χ2=0.113, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients without a diverting stoma, the anstomotic leak rate was 3.1% (22/699) and 1.0% (3/301) (χ2=3.993, P&lt;0.05), anastomotic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate was 1.6% (11/699) and 2.3% (7/301) (χ2=0.673, P&gt;0.05), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> rate was 3.4% (31/910) and 5.8% (25/434) (χ2=4.077, P&lt;0.05), chyle leak rate was 5.8% (53/910) and 3.7% (16/434) (χ2=2.757, P&gt;0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo> rate was 1.5% (14/910) and 1.6% (7/434) (χ2=0.011, P&gt;0.05), wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate was 2.2% (20/910) and 4.6% (20/434) (χ2=5.913, P&lt;0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> rate was 6.4% (58/910) and 10.6% (46/434) (χ2=7.349, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The overall postoperative complication rate in laparoscopic surgery is significantly lower than that in open surgery </plain></SENT>
