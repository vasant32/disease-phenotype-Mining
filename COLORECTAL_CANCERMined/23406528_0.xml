<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: There has been a strong preclinical rationale for studying mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) inhibitors as single agents or in combination, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple malignancies</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in particular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: The authors summarize the complete clinical experience to date of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials, both published and in abstract form, of everolimus in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While initial Phase I trials showed promise, further studies have confirmed that single agent everolimus is not active in advanced metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with trials showing single agent tolerability, but without significant hints of efficacy in terms of either objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses or prolonged stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combination regimens, including combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and inhibitors of VEGF, EGFR and HDAC have been tested specifically in the colorectal setting in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors discuss the potential reasons for mixed results and suggest future directions for the development of everolimus in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Studies demonstrate limited clinical activity of everolimus for the treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and have been complicated by increases in toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the central role of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biology suggests that other drug combinations with mTOR inhibition may still merit evaluation </plain></SENT>
