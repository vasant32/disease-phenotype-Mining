<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Using a multi-institutional database, we identified 1,004 patients treated for sCRLM between 1982 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic and outcomes data were evaluated with uni- and multivariable analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A simultaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and liver operation was performed in 329 (33%) patients; 675 (67%) underwent a staged approach ("classic" staged approach, n = 647; liver-first strategy, n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients managed with the liver-first approach had more hepatic lesions and were more likely to have bilateral disease than those in the other 2 groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of staged operative strategies increased over the time of the study from 58% to 75% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liver-directed therapy included hepatectomy (90%) or combined resection + ablation (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A major resection (&gt;3 segments) was more common with a staged approach (39% vs 24%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 509 patients (50%) received chemotherapy in either the preoperative (22%) or adjuvant (28%) settings, with 11% of patients having both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 197 patients (20%) who had a complication in the postoperative period, with no difference in morbidity between staged and simultaneous groups or major vs minor hepatectomies (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ninety-day postoperative mortality was 3.0%, with no difference between simultaneous and staged approaches (p = 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall median and 5-year survivals were 50.9 months and 44%, respectively; long-term survival was the same regardless of the operative approach (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous and staged resections for sCRLM can be performed with comparable morbidity, mortality, and long-term oncologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
