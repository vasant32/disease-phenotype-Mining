<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases in which hypersensitivity reactions developed in 623 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes of patients who underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> rechallenge with rechallenge protocol (STEP 1: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>, chlorpheniramine, and/or <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi>; STEP 2: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> with an escalating dose to 500 mg, and/or prolonged administration time of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>; and STEP 3: STEP 2 plus a subcutaneous injection of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 623 patients, 126 (20.2%) patients developed hypersensitivity reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of these 126 patients, 99 (78.6%) underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> rechallenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> rechallenge, 19 patients received subsequent treatment without the rechallenge protocol and 80 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> with the rechallenge protocol of STEP 1 (n=64), STEP 2 (n=15), and STEP 3 (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> rechallenges was 3 (range=1 to 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression in 55 patients (56%) and hypersensitivity reactions in 21 patients (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall hypersensitivity reactions after rechallenge were observed in 59%, with grade 3/4 in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rechallenge protocol is an effective treatment option for patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> hypersensitivity reactions </plain></SENT>
