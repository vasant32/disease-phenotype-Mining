<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Forty-two patients with stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent curative resection in our hospital during a one year period in 2005 were enrolled in the preliminary pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 2006 and 2007, 104 patients with stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent curative resection in our hospital were chosen and were randomly divided into two groups, 3-week method or 4-week method (4-week administration and 2-week withdrawal) for a prospective randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The one-year completion rate in the 3-week method group was 98% (50/51) which was significantly better than that in the 4-week method group, 68% (36/53) (p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in both laboratory and clinical findings in the pilot study and in the prospective randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three-week method of S-1 administration had good feasibility, easily manageable toxicity, high accumulated dose in one year and good compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-week method with S-1 may be a standard adjuvant chemotherapy schedule for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
