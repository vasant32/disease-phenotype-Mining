<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of expression of the DSB repair proteins have previously been shown to be associated with poorer survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wished to ascertain the relationship of altered expression of the DSB repair proteins γ-H2AX (gamma-H2AX), ATM and Ku70 with biological and clinico-pathological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>908 tumours from the VICTOR clinical trial of stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were analysed for expression of γ-H2AX, ATM and Ku70 using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression levels were correlated with CIN and with disease-free survival, correcting for microsatellite instability, BRAF/KRAS mutation status, Dukes stage, chemo/radiotherapy, age, gender and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Down-regulated Ku70 expression was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> (p=0.029) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced ATM expression was an independent marker of poor disease-free survival (HR=1.67, 95% CI 1.11-2.50, p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For Ku70, further studies are required to investigate the potential relationship of non-homologous end joining with <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Loss of ATM expression might serve as a biomarker of poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
