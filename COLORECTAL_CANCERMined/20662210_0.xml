<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is indicated for the treatment of superficial, early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> because of its minimal invasiveness and excellent results in terms of clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional EMR techniques currently used for the resection of laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (LSTs), however, are inadequate for the en-bloc resection of flat lesions &gt; or =20 mm because both incomplete removal and local recurrence have been observed and reported on occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widespread as a minimally invasive treatment for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, however, it is not as widely used in the colorectum because of its technical difficulty and complication risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INDICATIONS FOR COLORECTAL ESD: Based on clinicopathological analyses of LSTs, the indication for colorectal ESD is an LST non-granular type (LST-NG) &gt;20 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LST granular type (LST-G) &gt;30 mm or 40 mm are possible candidates for ESD because they have a higher submucosal (SM) invasion rate and are difficult to treat even by endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection (EPMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ESD PROCEDURES: ESD procedures were performed using a ball tip bipolar needle knife (B-knife) and an insulation-tip knife (IT knife) with carbon dioxide (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) insufflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">Glycerol</z:chebi> and 0.4% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> were used as an SM injection solution in order to provide longer lasting SM elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ESD is an effective technique for treating colorectal IST-NGs&gt;20 mm and LST-Gs&gt;30 mm providing a higher en-bloc resection rate as well as being less invasive than surgery </plain></SENT>
