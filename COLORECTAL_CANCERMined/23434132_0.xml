<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the course of our ongoing efforts to develop novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> conjugates with enhanced stability profiles, we introduced an isopropyloxycarbonylmethoxy (POC) group to 7-OH and/or 3-OH of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> and prepared three novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> conjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>-POC conjugates were stable up to 96h in PBS but slowly hydrolyzed with half-lives of 1-54h in cell-free culture medium, which is reminiscent of the stability profiles of the previously reported <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>-POM (pivaloxymethyl) conjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>-POC conjugates were more susceptible to passive transport, intracellular hydrolysis, and metabolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (MCF-7) cell line compared with their POM congeners to result in low concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> in this cell line and thereby low antiproliferative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, upon incubation with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> HCT116 cells, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>-POC conjugates were shown to undergo slow hydrolysis and metabolism to maintain concentrations of the active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> species high enough to exert enhanced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>-POC conjugates synthesized in this study exhibited cell type-specific stability as well as bioactivity profiles, which warrants further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
