<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of a tryptophan-related autofluorescence has been reported to be increased in murine <z:mp ids='MP_0000477'>intestinal dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The emission spectra of cells isolated from human <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa of the colon were studied and showed markedly greater emission intensity from cancerous cells compared to cells obtained from the surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A proto-type multispectral imaging system optimized for ultraviolet macroscopic imaging of tissue was used to obtain autofluorescence images of surgical specimens of colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence images did not display the expected greater emission from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> as compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, most probably due to increased optical absorption and scattering in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased fluorescence intensity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was observed however, once fluorescence images were corrected using reflectance images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tryptophan fluorescence alone may be useful in differentiating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and cancerous cells, while in tissues its autofluorescence image divided by green reflectance may be useful in displaying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
