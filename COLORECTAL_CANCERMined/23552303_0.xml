<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) stage at presentation and mortality in a vulnerable population compared with nationally representative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were identified from San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of the SFGH cohort presented with advanced disease, compared with 44% of the SEER cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased risk of advanced stage at presentation at SFGH compared with SEER was most evident among blacks and Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was weak evidence for worse survival at SFGH compared with SEER overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This varied by race with poorer survival at SFGH among whites and possibly blacks but some evidence for better survival among Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients at SFGH, Asians and Hispanics had better survival than whites and blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At SFGH, 44% had a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> within 1 year of establishing care there </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those who had established care at SFGH for at least 1 year, only 22% had exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings allow examination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> presentation by ethnicity in vulnerable populations and identify areas where access and utilization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening can be improved </plain></SENT>
