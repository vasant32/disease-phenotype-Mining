<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, quantifying the proportion of older Americans UTD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> and pneumococcal vaccinations, mammograms, Papanicolaou tests, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison of projected changes in UTD levels and disparities was ascertained by numerically accounting for UTD adults lacking 1 or more clinical preventive services (CPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed by gender and race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expanded provision of specific vaccinations and screenings each increased UTD levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When those needing only vaccinations were immunized, there was a projected decrease in racial/ethnic disparities in UTD levels (2.3%-12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When those needing only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, mammography, or Papanicolaou test were screened, there was an increase in UTD disparities (1.6%-4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A primary care and public health focus on adult immunizations, in addition to other CPS, offers an effective strategy to reduce disparities while improving UTD levels </plain></SENT>
