<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate whether the Ki67 proliferation index can provide similar prognostic and predictive information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue microarrays were constructed from triplicate cores of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for Ki67 was performed with the SP6 antibody and the percentage of positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognostic significance was evaluated in 867 cancers (601 events) using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Ki67 labelling index, divided at the median, was not a statistically or clinically significant prognostic factor in univariate analyses of 5-year overall survival (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.15, p=0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses were similarly non-significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in Dukes' stage C patients, the high Ki67 subgroup derived a greater 5-year overall survival benefit from chemotherapy (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.51, p&lt;0.0001) than the low subgroup (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.89, p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Ki67 proliferation index is not a useful prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but deserves further evaluation as a predictive factor for the incremental benefit derived from adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
