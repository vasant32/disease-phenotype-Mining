<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this meta-analysis was to update the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk of ulcerative and Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, investigate time trends, and identify high-risk modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : The MEDLINE search engine was used to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published cohort studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Publications were critically appraised for study population, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> localization, censoring for colectomy, and patient inclusion methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following data were extracted: total and stratified person-years at risk, number of observed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, number of expected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in background population, time period of inclusion, and geographical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled standardized incidence ratios and cumulative risks for 10-year disease intervals were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were corrected for colectomy and isolated small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : The pooled standardized incidence ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with IBD in population-based studies was 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.2 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-risk groups were patients with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and an IBD diagnosis before age 30 with standardized incidence ratios of 6.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.4-17.5) and 7.2 (95% confidence interval, 2.9-17.8), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cumulative risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 1%, 2%, and 5% after 10, 20, and &gt;20 years of disease duration, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is increased in patients with IBD but not as high as previously reported and not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This decline could be the result of aged cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is significantly higher in patients with longer disease duration, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e>, and IBD diagnosis at young age </plain></SENT>
