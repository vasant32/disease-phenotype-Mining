<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EMS1-siRNA lentiviral vector and negative control lentiviral vector were both transfected into HCT8 cells after virus packing, then the expression of Cortactin of the cells was examined by Western blot to determine the inhibited level of Cortactin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells were defined as three groups: EMS1-siRNA transfecting cells, negative control transfecting cells and un-transfection cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell invasion was evaluated with Transwell body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, cells <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was observed in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice were evenly divided into three groups and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the mice were injected through tail vein with 1Ã—10(7) cells/0.2 ml per animal for each group with the three kinds of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after injection and examined for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of Cortactin and the ability of invasion of the EMS1-siRNA transfecting cells were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> rates of EMS1-siRNA transfecting group, negative control group and un-transfection group were 20%, 80% and 80%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: siRNA silencing of Cortactin expression can decrease the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells invasion, and can also decrease the cells' implantation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in animals </plain></SENT>
