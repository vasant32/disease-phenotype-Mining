<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Far UpStream Element (FUSE)-binding protein-interacting repressor (FIR), a c-myc transcriptional suppressor, is alternatively spliced removing the transcriptional repression domain within exon 2 (FIRΔexon2) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAP155 is a subunit of the essential splicing factor 3b (SF3b) subcomplex in the spliceosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to study the significance of the FIR-SAP155 interaction for the coordination of c-myc transcription, pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing, and c-Myc protein modification, as well as to interrogate FIRΔexon2 for other functions relating to altered FIR pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of SAP155 or FIR was used to investigate their reciprocal influence on each other and on c-myc transcription, pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing, and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pull down from HeLa cell nuclear extracts revealed the association of FIR, FIRΔexon2, and SF3b subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FIR and FIRΔexon2 were coimmunoprecipitated with SAP155 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FIR and FIRΔexon2 adenovirus vector (Ad-FIR and Ad-FIRΔexon2, respectively) were prepared to test for their influence on c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FIR, SAP155, SAP130, and c-myc were coordinately upregulated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results reveal that SAP155 and FIR/FIRΔexon2 form a complex and are mutually upregulating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ad-FIRΔexon2 antagonized Ad-FIR transcriptional repression of c-myc in HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because FIRΔexon2 still carries RRM1 and RRM2 and binding activity to FUSE, it is able to displace repression competent FIR from FUSE in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, thus thwarting FIR-mediated transcriptional repression by FUSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus aberrant FIRΔexon2 production in turn sustained c-Myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, altered FIR and c-myc pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing, in addition to c-Myc expression by augmented FIR/FIRΔexon2-SAP155 complex, potentially contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
