<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although it is accepted that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancers</z:e> (mCRCs) that carry activating mutations in KRAS are unresponsive to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies, a significant fraction of KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) mCRCs are also unresponsive to anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genes encoding EGFR ligands amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) are promising gene expression-based markers but have not been incorporated into a test to dichotomise KRAS wt mCRC patients with respect to sensitivity to anti-EGFR treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used RT-PCR to test 110 candidate gene expression markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> from 144 KRAS wt mCRC patients who received monotherapy with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated with multiple clinical endpoints: disease control, objective response, and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of many of the tested candidate genes, including EREG and AREG, strongly associate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate analysis with two-layer five-fold cross-validation, we constructed a four-gene predictive classifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, patients below the classifier cutpoint had PFS and disease control rates similar to those of patients with KRAS mutant mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gene expression appears to identify KRAS wt mCRC patients who receive little benefit from cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It will be important to test this model in an independent validation study </plain></SENT>
