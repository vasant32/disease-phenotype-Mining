<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among participants in the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ovarian Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial who underwent baseline and follow-up sigmoidoscopy (n=17,072), we identified 1008 individuals with incident distal colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations between meat and meat-related components and incident distal colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed suggestive positive associations for red meat, processed meat, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">haeme</z:chebi> iron, and nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> with distal colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grilled meat (OR=1.56, 95% CI=1.04-2.36), well or very well-done meat (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.05-2.43), 2-amino-1-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-6-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-imidazo[4,5-b]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16227">pyridine</z:chebi> (PhIP) (OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.17-2.64), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29865">benzo[a]pyrene</z:chebi> (OR=1.53, 95% CI=1.06-2.20), and total mutagenic activity (OR=1.57, 95% CI=1.03-2.40) were positively associated with rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total iron (diet and supplements) (OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.56-0.86) and iron from supplements (OR=0.65, 95% CI=0.44-0.97) were inversely associated with any distal colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that several meat-related components may be most relevant to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, total iron and iron from supplements were inversely associated with any distal colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
