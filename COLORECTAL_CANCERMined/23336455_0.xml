<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients do not have symptoms meeting national referral criteria for rapid investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk assessment tools (RATs) have been developed to assist GPs in selecting patient for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the usability and acceptability of lung and colorectal RATs, as well as subsequent resource use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study with nested qualitative study with 614 GPs from 165 practices in seven English <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> networks were provided with RATs applicable to patients aged â‰¥40 years with bowel or respiratory symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In-depth interviews were conducted with 34 individuals (11 project managers and 23 GPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The study measured the number of RATs used, and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> investigations and diagnoses, over a 6-month period and compared these with the previous 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2593 RATs (1160 lung, 1433 colorectal) were completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the preceding 6 months, there were 292 more chest X-rays, 104 extra 2-week chest clinic appointments, and 47 additional diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, there were 304 more 2-week referrals, 270 more colonoscopies, and 10 more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RATs appeared to help GPs in their selection of patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Users reported that RATs helped to confirm a need for investigation as well as allowing reassurance when investigation was not needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of RATs in primary care was accompanied by increased diagnostic activity and additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
