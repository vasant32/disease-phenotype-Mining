<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have assessed the relationship between the polymorphism of TNF-α-308 G&gt;A and the susceptibility to IBD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; however, the results have been controversial </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated on the basis of data from 14, 18, and 7 studies from a total of 27 studies for the associations between the polymorphism of TNF-α-308 G&gt;A and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Europeans, the AA genotype increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) (OR, 2.041; 95% CI, 1.261-3.301) and CD (OR, 1.730; 95% CI, 1.168-2.564) significantly, without obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and publication bias </plain></SENT>
