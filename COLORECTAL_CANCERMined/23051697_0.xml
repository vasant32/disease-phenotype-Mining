<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about clinical risk factors associated with advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (CRN) despite negative FIT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the clinical predictors of advanced CRN despite negative FIT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed FITs for asymptomatic subjects â‰¥50 years from January 2009 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent colonoscopy for a medical check-up, despite a negative FIT result, were included to evaluate the clinical predictors of advanced CRN based on colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 373 subjects underwent screening colonoscopy despite their negative FIT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among those 373 subjects, 356 (95.4%) did not show any advanced CRNs; however, 17 (4.6%) subjects showed advanced CRNs on their colonoscopies despite negative FIT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Being a first-degree relative of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient was significantly associated with advanced CRNs in univariate analysis (p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, being a first-degree relative of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient was a significant predictor of advanced CRNs despite negative FIT results (OR 7.33; 95% CI, 0.53-35.08; p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: First-degree relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients are likely to show advanced CRNs despite a negative FIT </plain></SENT>
