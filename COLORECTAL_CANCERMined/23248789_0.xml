<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previously developed screening colonoscopy algorithms based on diagnostic and endoscopy procedural variables have not been sufficiently accurate for use in epidemiological and health services research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To increase understanding of the administrative health database variables that could help to discern screening and nonscreening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A qualitative study using physician focus groups was conducted in Montreal (Quebec), Calgary (Alberta) and Toronto (Ontario) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specialty-specific focus group sessions were held among family physicians and gastroenterologists - the physicians responsible for referring patients to and performing screening colonoscopy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interview guides were developed to better understand physician clinical and billing practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discussions were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the constant comparative approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty family physicians and seven gastroenterologists participated in five focus group sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient variables included demographics (age) and medical history (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors⁄symptoms, medication for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors⁄symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e>, severe disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical practice variables included timing of the colonoscopy (evenings, weekends, holidays, during hospitalization; same-day endoscopist consultation and colonoscopy), use of services (hospitalization, annual examination, transfer from other facility) and procedure use patterns (large bowel or other medical⁄surgical procedure before and subsequent to colonoscopy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, wide variability in clinical and billing practices will likely preclude the development of a reasonably accurate screening colonoscopy algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physicians suggested adding a screening colonoscopy code to the administrative health data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Failure to acknowledge the limitations of the provincial administrative health databases to identify screening colonoscopy may lead to incorrect conclusions and the establishment of inappropriate health care policies </plain></SENT>
