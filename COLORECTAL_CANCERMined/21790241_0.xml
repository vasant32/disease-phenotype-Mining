<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is a common disease in the older population, but it has become increasingly evident that it is also not infrequent in the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical and pathological characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in young Cambodians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined clinical and pathological data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases registered in the two reference centres for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017185" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal tumours</z:e> in Cambodia between 2005-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence rates were computed using the national population census 2008 data from the National Institute of Statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared differences in distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, histology, differentiation and UICC/TNM stage in two age groups, namely &lt; 40 and â‰¥ 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During this period, there were 356 new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases, of which 29.8% affected patients younger than 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This proportion is the second highest in the world, with a higher proportion only reported in Egyptian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence was 2.82 and 2.36 per 100,000 in females and males, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was the most common histologic type, and &gt;50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> occurred in the colon, with no appreciable variation between the two age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mucin-producing and advanced-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were twice more frequent in the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The unusually high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> proportion in the young in our study could be due to referral bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, together with the continuous exposure to hazardous environmental agents and the prevalent consanguinity in Cambodia, this question warrants further research to advance our understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors and perhaps genetic-environmental interactions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> epidemiology in young adults </plain></SENT>
