<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> are often treated with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for purposes of palliation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of those who experience subsequent intracranial disease progression can include a second course of WBRT, although there is controversy surrounding its safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the outcomes in patients at Massachusetts General Hospital who underwent reirradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the medical records of 17 patients at Massachusetts General Hospital with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> who were initially treated with WBRT between 2002 and 2008 and were subsequently retreated with a second course of WBRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median dose for the first course of WBRT was 35 Gy (range, 28-40 Gy), with a fraction size of 2 to 3 Gy (median, 2.5 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median dose at reirradiation was 21.6 Gy (range, 14-30 Gy), with a fraction size of 1.5 to 2 Gy (median, 1.8 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The second course of WBRT was administered upon radiographic disease progression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 10 patients with complete follow-up data, 8 patients experienced complete or partial symptom resolution, and 2 did not show clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time to radiographic progression was 5.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was 24.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival time after initiation of reirradiation was 5.2 months (95% CI, 1.3-8.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients with stable extracranial disease, the median survival time after retreatment was 19.8 months (95% CI, 2.7-âˆž), compared with 2.5 months (95% CI, 0.8-5.5) for those with extracranial disease progression (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> adverse reactions occurred in 70.5% of patients but were mild to moderate in severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In select patients and especially those with stable extracranial disease, reirradiation may be an appropriate and effective intervention to provide symptomatic relief and slow intracranial disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Side effects were minimal and did not cause substantial changes in quality of life </plain></SENT>
