<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the diagnostic significance of HMGB1 has not been evaluated in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we have screened the expression and secretion of HMGB1 in 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines and 1 control cell line and found that HMGB1 was detected in the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the diagnostic value of HMGB1, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure HMGB1 levels and compared them to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the serum samples of 219 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients and 75 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the serum HMGB1 level was increased by 1.5-fold in patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> compared to those in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When HMGB1 and CEA levels were compared, HMGB1 had similar efficacy as CEA regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection (the sensitivity was 20.1% for HMGB1 vs. 25.6% for CEA, and the specificity was 96% for HMGB1 vs. 90.7% for CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of HMGB1 for stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was significantly higher than that of CEA (sensitivity: 41.2% vs. 5.9%; specificity: 96% vs. 90.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When we combined HMGB1 and CEA, the overall diagnostic sensitivity was higher than that of CEA alone (42% vs. 25.6%), and the diagnostic sensitivity for stage I was also elevated (47% vs. 5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the prognosis of patients was not related with serum HMGB1 concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that serum HMGB1 levels are increased in a subset of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, suggesting their potential utility as a supportive diagnostic marker for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
