<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its long-term efficacy and safety remain obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose here was to review our experience with laparoscopic colectomy in 899 patients between June 2001 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of them, 43 patients were converted to open surgery and 846 accepted laparoscopic colorectomy successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these 846 patients, 790 patients underwent radical resection and 56 patients underwent palliative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient died from perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo>; thus the mortality was 0.12% (1/846) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The morbidity of perioperative complications was 18.20% (154/846): intraoperative complication rate was 4.49% (38/846) and the most common intraoperative complication was subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> (1.65%, 14/846); postoperative complication rate was 13.71% (116/846) and the most common postoperative complication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> (4.37%, 37/846) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall followed-up rate was 86.41% (731/846, 680 for radical operations and 51 palliative operations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> happened to 139 patients, including 112 after radical operation and 27 after palliative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 112 patients, 97 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related (14.26%, 97/680) and 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 10 patients encountered local recurrence (1.47%, 10/680) and 105 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (15.44%, 105/680) after radical operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients are still alive with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rate was 80.98% (592/731), 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate after radical operation was 78.0%, and 3-year DFS rate after radical operation for stage I, stage II, and stage III was 89.0%, 85.0%, and 65.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, laparoscopic colorectal resection is a feasible and safe technology for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
