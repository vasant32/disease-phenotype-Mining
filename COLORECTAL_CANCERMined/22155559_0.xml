<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing patients' awareness about the importance of surveillance might improve attendance, but it is not clear how much they know about their follow-up recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the awareness of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> about their surveillance recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten endoscopy departments provided access to their colonoscopy database for quality assurance; 2 datasets were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data from 4000 colonoscopies (400 per department) performed on patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were mailed a survey to determine how much information they had about their colonoscopy results and their follow-up recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from 549 patients were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also assessed surveillance attendance among 500 patients (50 per department) who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients analyzed, 85% recalled retrieval of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> during their colonoscopy, and 85% recalled whether they needed surveillance or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The indication for surveillance was recalled by 69% of patients (range between departments, 55%-83%; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors that were associated with awareness of recommendations were younger age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.09), treatment by a gastroenterologist (OR, 5.53; 95% CI, 3.28-9.32), and presence of 3 or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.29-6.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Attendance among patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> varied among departments, from 60% to 89% (P &lt; .01), and was not associated with awareness of patients about their recommendations per department (P = .59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Not enough patients (only 85%) who receive colonoscopies are aware of their results or surveillance recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although awareness of findings and recommendations did not correlate with follow-up attendance, patients should be better informed about findings and their need for surveillance </plain></SENT>
