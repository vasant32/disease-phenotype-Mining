<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Faecal occult blood test (FOBt) is commonly requested by clinicians in both primary and secondary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the use and outcomes of clinician-requested FOB testing in a single Trust taking part in the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme pilots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from a single Trust was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Trust's pathology reporting system was searched retrospectively for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FOBt study requests in 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with a positive test, the Trust's clinical results reporting system was searched to determine the type and outcome of any investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive tests were cross-matched with the Trust's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> database to detect interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1363 FOB tests were requested during the calendar year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>715 (52.5%) were completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 60.6 years, 30.7% of patients were in the screening age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>60 (4.4%) patients were FOBt positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total colonic imaging was performed in only 22% of those who were FOBt positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant pathology was detected in five patients (0.4%) including three colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in the FOBt-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of FOBt requests has increased with the introduction of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The FOBt completion rate and colonic imaging rate in FOBt-positive patients outside the national screening programme was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Guidelines for the use of FOBt outside of screening are needed </plain></SENT>
