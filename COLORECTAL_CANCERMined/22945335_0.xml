<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety in the use of DC vaccine combined with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>; these two methods are commonly used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> separately as monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methodology: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> orally twice daily at 1,250mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One cycle included two weeks of treatment followed by one week's rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received 1Ã—107 tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccinations both intradermally and intravenously every week for 3 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: There was an improvement in appetite in 14/17 cases and an increase of physical strength 15/17 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum CEA level was reduced and the phenotypes of peripheral blood T lymphocytes CD3+, CD8+ and CD56+ increased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; 4 out of the 17 patients were DTH positive and 14 patients were alive at the end of 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No server toxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>Lymphopenia</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> then followed by DC vaccine is an effective way to generate anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immune response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
