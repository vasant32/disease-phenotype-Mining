<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study retrospectively reviewed the cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who underwent both liver and lung resection to define the appropriate indications for surgical resection in patients with hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 39 patients with both hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> underwent both liver and lung resection from January 1987 to December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and overall survival (OS) from the resection for the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were evaluated by a Kaplan-Meyer analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors were analyzed using the log-rank test and a Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and the 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were 12 months and 2.6 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival time (MST) and 5-year OS rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were 66 months and 48.3 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MST of the patients with a long (&gt;1 year) disease-free interval (DFI) could not be calculated, but their 5-year OS rate was 73.7 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the MST and 5-year OS rate of the patients with a short (&lt;1 year) DFI were 29 months and 37.5 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The short DFI was the only prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive surgical resection of both hepatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> should be undertaken in selective patients, including those with a long DFI </plain></SENT>
