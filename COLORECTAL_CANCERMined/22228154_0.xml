<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation in the BRAF oncogene is a key step in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> within the methylator pathway to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is a paucity of information about BRAF mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study defines the clinical characteristics and oncologic outcome associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> from a single-institution frozen-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biobank were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed for mutations in the BRAF oncogene by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A sample was classified as mutant if any of the tested loci were mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics were recorded including patient age, sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, and microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statistical associations with BRAF mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were determined by the Fisher exact probability test, Ï‡ test, or Wilcoxon analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-five colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were included in the study population; 56 samples harbored a BRAF mutation (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between BRAF <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in age (66 vs 75 years, p = 0.004), female sex (44% vs 71%, p &lt; 0.001), proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (44% vs 95%, p &lt; 0.001), and frequency of microsatellite instability (16% vs 76%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage between BRAF mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival data were analyzed for 322 patients with stage I to III disease, and patients with a BRAF mutation had decreased overall survival than those without a mutation (p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With the use of Cox regression analysis, BRAF mutation conferred a worse overall survival (HR 1.79, CI 1.05-3.05, p = 0.03) independent of microsatellite instability status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BRAF mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are associated with distinct clinical characteristics and worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
