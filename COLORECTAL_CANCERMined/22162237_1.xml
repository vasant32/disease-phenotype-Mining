<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed associations between dietary intake of heterocyclic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCAs</z:e>) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29865">benzo(a)pyrene</z:chebi> (BaP)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> formed in meat cooked at high temperatures-and incident exocrine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> in a prospective cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 62 581 subjects randomized to screening in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Screening Trial (PLCO) who completed an initial dietary survey that assessed meat intake, cooking methods, and doneness preferences defined the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were surveyed annually for incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> through 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute research database (CHARRED) was used to estimate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> and BaP intake and a Mutagenic Activity Index (MAI) from survey data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> were estimated from multi-variate Cox regression models by quintile of intake, with the lowest quintile as the referent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up (median: 10 yr), 248 cases of exocrine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preferences for well and very well done meat were generally associated with increased risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant elevations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> risk were found in upper quintiles of MAI, and individual <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36616">quinoxaline</z:chebi> (DiMeIQx) and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36616">quinoxaline</z:chebi> (MeIQx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to the lowest quintile of MAI, the third and fifth quintiles brought HRs of 1.86 (1.22, 2.85) and 1.87 (1.16, 3.02), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These three exposures exhibited significant (P-trend: 0.01-0.03) positive trends in risk as their levels increased CONCLUSION: Consuming well-done meat cooked at high temperatures, which contains high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> levels, appears to confer increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
