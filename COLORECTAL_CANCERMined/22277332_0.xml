<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: E-cadherin expression has been associated with an outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and serum levels of soluble E-cadherin (sE-cadherin) are significantly elevated in patients with malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic value of serum sE-cadherin level has not been demonstrated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 186 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 21 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum sE-cadherin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between serum sE-cadherin level and clinicopathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean serum sE-cadherin levels were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean sE-cadherin levels were significantly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e>, UICC classification, and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum sE-cadherin level was an independent risk factor for predicting poor prognosis, and was an independent marker for predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e>, the prognosis was significantly worse in patients with elevated serum sE-cadherin levels than in those with lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative elevated sE-cadherin level is associated with poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measuring serum sE-cadherin may provide valuable information for predicting prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
