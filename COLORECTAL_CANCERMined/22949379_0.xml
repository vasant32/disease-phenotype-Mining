<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mismatch repair (MMR) gene sequence variants of uncertain clinical significance are often identified in suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> families, and this constitutes a challenge for both researchers and clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multifactorial likelihood model approaches provide a quantitative measure of MMR variant pathogenicity, but first require input of likelihood ratios (LRs) for different MMR variation-associated characteristics from appropriate, well-characterized reference datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability (MSI) and somatic BRAF <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> data for unselected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> probands of known pathogenic variant status were used to derive LRs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> Family Registry (CFR) resource </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> LRs were combined with variant segregation within families, and estimates of prior probability of pathogenicity based on sequence conservation and position, to analyze 44 unclassified variants identified initially in Australasian Colon CFR families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, in vitro splicing analyses were conducted on the subset of variants based on bioinformatic splicing predictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LR in favor of pathogenicity was estimated to be ~12-fold for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> with a BRAF mutation-negative MSI-H phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 31 of the 44 variants, the posterior probabilities of pathogenicity were such that altered clinical management would be indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide a working multifactorial likelihood model for classification that carefully considers mode of ascertainment for gene testing </plain></SENT>
