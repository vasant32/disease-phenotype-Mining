<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that elevated systemic oxidative status would be associated with later occurrence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath>, a precursor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the prospective association between four systemic markers of oxidative status and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> within a nondiabetic subcohort of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (n = 425) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urine samples were collected from 1992 to 1994 and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> prevalence were assessed in 2002 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oxidative status markers were assessed, which included four F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs) from the classes III and IV: iPF2α-III, 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III (a metabolite of iPF2α-III), iPF2α-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biomarkers were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospective associations were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for occurrence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and scaled to 1 SD of F(2)-IsoP distribution were 1.16 (95% CI, 0.88-1.50), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.63-1.17), 1.04 (95% CI, 0.80-1.34), and 1.16 (95% CI, 0.90-1.48) for iPF2α-III, iPF2α-VI, 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI, and 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The lack of association between F(2)-IsoPs and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> does not support the hypothesis that elevated oxidative status is associated with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> occurrence during a 10-year period of follow-up </plain></SENT>
