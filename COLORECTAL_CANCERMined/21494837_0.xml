<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The natural compound pancratistatin (PST), isolated from the Hymenocallis littoralis plant, specifically induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike many other chemotherapeutics, PST is not genotoxic and has minimal adverse effects on non-cancerous cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its availability for preclinical and clinical work is limited due to its low availability in its natural source and difficulties in its chemical synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several synthetic analogues of 7-deoxypancratistatin with different modifications at C-1 were synthesized and screened for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inducing activity in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that a C-1 acetoxymethyl derivative of 7-deoxypancratistatin, JC-TH-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-4 (JCTH-4), was effective in inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both p53 positive (HCT 116) and p53 negative (HT-29) human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, demonstrating similar efficacy to that of natural PST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>JCTH-4 was able to decrease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (MMP), increase levels of reactive oxygen species in isolated mitochondria, cause release of the apoptogenic factor <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> (Cyto c) from isolated mitochondria, and induce autophagy in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when JCTH-4 was administered with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> (TAM), there was an enhanced effect in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Cyto c release by isolated mitochondria, and autophagic induction by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minimal toxicity was exhibited by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human fetal fibroblast (NFF) and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon fibroblast (CCD-18Co) cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, JCTH-4 is a novel compound capable of selectively inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and autophagy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells alone and in combination with TAM and may serve as a safer and more effective alternative to current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
