<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The colorectum is known to be the most difficult organ to perform endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), however, the training has not been sufficiently established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our hospital, the essential condition to start colorectal ESD was to experience at least 30 gastric ESD and to have sufficient knowledge and techniques beforehand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rectal ESD were initially performed under supervision of ESD experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to their technical acquisition, the ESD experts allocated lesions to the trainees from smaller lesions in the distal colon to larger lesions in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively investigated the outcomes of 92 and 23 colorectal ESD performed by two trainee endoscopists (A/B) who gained experience on our training scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rates of en bloc/complete resection for A and B were 92.4%/73.9% and 95.7%/65.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, which occurred only with A, were 1.1%/3.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurred in one case (4.3%) in the later period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the later period, en bloc resection rate remained high in spite of the difficult lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our training scheme enabled trainees to perform colorectal ESD effectively and safely from the initial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Step-by-step accumulation of cases such as from the rectum to the colon may be desirable for the introduction of colorectal ESD </plain></SENT>
