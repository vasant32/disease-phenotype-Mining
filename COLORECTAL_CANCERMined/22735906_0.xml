<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: TAS-102 consists of α, α, α-trifluorothymidine (TFT) and an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase (TPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a dose-escalation phase I study in Japanese patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TAS-102 was administered twice daily on days 1-5 and days 8-12 in a 28-day cycle to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> refractory to standard chemotherapy, to determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and pharmacokinetics (PKs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MTD was evaluated in cycle 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Safety and PKs were evaluated in 21 patients treated with TAS-102 at 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70 mg m(-2) per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DLTs, such as grade 4 leucopenia, grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, were observed in two patients at doses of 30 and 70 mg m(-2). α, α, α-trifluorothymidine and TPI exposures increased dose dependently, and the percentage of decrease in neutrophil count and TFT exposure were significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disease control rate was 50.0% with a median progression-free survival of 2.4 months in 18 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dose of TAS-102 was not increased above 70 mg m(-2) per day because of the increased tendency for grade 3 and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and 70 mg m(-2) per day was the recommended dose for phase II studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TAS-102 at 70 mg m(-2) per day was tolerated in Japanese patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Phase II studies are ongoing in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
