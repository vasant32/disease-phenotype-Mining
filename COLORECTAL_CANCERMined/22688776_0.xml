<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The literature between 1995 and June 2009 was surveyed systematically through a review of published studies on the treatment outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> to the peritoneum on the Medline and PubMed databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2,492 patients from 19 studies were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One thousand and eighty-four patients treated with complete cytoreductive surgery (CCS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and 1,408 patients were treated with palliative surgery and/or systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For CCS HIPEC, the overall survival ranged between 20 and 63 (median 33) months, and 5-year survival ranged between 17% and 51% (median 40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For palliative surgery and/or systemic chemotherapy, the overall survival ranged between 5 and 24 (median 12.5) months, and 5-year survival ranged between 13% and 22% (median 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Systemic therapies have not proved effective and randomised clinical trials have not sufficiently addressed patient subpopulations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> of this entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current evidence have demonstrated the efficacy associated with CCS HIPEC for which should now be embraced as the standard of care </plain></SENT>
