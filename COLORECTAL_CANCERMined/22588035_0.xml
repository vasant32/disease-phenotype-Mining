<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The utility of this body of work is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to synthesize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such systematic reviews in terms of clinical effectiveness, to appraise their quality, and to determine whether areas of duplication exist across reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Systematic reviews comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were identified using a comprehensive search protocol (1991 to 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methodological quality of reviews was appraised using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abstraction and quality appraisal was carried out by two independent reviewers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reviews were synthesized, and outcomes were compared qualitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A citation analysis was carried out using simple matrices to assess the comprehensiveness of each review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 27 reviews were included; 13 reviews included only randomized controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Rectal cancer</z:e> was addressed exclusively by four reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was significant overlap between review purposes, populations and, outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean AMSTAR score (out of 11) was 5.8 (95% CI: 4.6 to 7.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was evaluated by ten reviews, none of which found a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three reviews provided a selective meta-analysis of time-to-event data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Previously published systematic reviews were poorly and highly selectively referenced (mean citation ratio 0.16, 95% CI: 0.093 to 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Previously published trials were not comprehensively identified and cited (mean citation ratio 0.56, 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Numerous overlapping systematic reviews of laparoscopic and open surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> exist in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Despite variable methods and quality, survival outcomes are congruent across reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A duplication of research efforts appears to exist in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Further systematic reviews or meta-analyses are unlikely to be justified without specifying a significantly different research objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This works lends support to the registration and updating of systematic reviews </plain></SENT>
