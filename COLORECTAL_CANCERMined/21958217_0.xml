<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCE: Statutory health insurance sample in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Overestimation of the incidence in the first quarter of 2008 for three selected diseases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, depending on different lengths of preceding disease-free intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Continuously insured from 2000 until 2008 â‰¥ 18 years (N = 144,907) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared with an 8-year disease-free period, incidence overestimations for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were 40, 23, and 43 percent defining a 1-year, and 5, 9, and 5 percent defining a 5-year disease-free period, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the specific disease, caution has to be taken while using short disease-free periods because incidence estimates may be extremely overestimated </plain></SENT>
