<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>miRNAs have emerged as post-transcriptional regulators that are critically involved in the pathogenesis of a number of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cdc42, one of the best characterized members of the Rho GTPase family, is found to be up-regulated in several types of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> initiation and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have identified miR-137 as a potential regulator of Cdc42 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A bioinformatics search revealed a putative target-site for miR-137 within the Cdc42 3' UTR at nt 792-798, which is highly conserved across different species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of miR-137 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines was found inversely correlated with Cdc42 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>miR-137 could significantly suppress Cdc42 3' UTR luciferase-reporter activity, and this effect was not detectable when the putative 3' UTR target-site was mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the results of the reporter assay, ectopic expression of miR-137 reduced both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels of Cdc42 and mimicked the effect of Cdc42 knockdown in inhibiting proliferation, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest, and blocking invasion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, whereas anti-miR-137 expression led to the opposite effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression of miR-137 suppressed the immediate downstream effector of Cdc42, PAK signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that miR-137 may have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor function by directly targeting Cdc42 to inhibit the proliferation and invasion activities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They raise an interesting possibility that Cdc42 activity and function can be controlled by miRNAs in addition to the classic regulators such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins </plain></SENT>
