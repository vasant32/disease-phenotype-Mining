<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the specific procedure which differs from that of open surgery, it is imperative to establish a unique training system to promote efficiency of learning laparoscopic skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of learning laparoscopic skills with or without authorized experts of JSES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Among 71 patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomy from 2004 to 2009, 30 patients who underwent operation in introduction era without a technical expert (2004-2006), 17 patients who underwent operation in late period of introduction era without a technical expert (2006-2008), 12 patients who underwent operation by resident with technical expert (2008-2009) and 12 patients who underwent operation by technical expert, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operative time, amount of blood loss, intra- and post-operative complications and conversion to open surgery were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative time: 477:333:262:220 minutes (early period:late period:resident:expert), amount of blood loss: 494:73:21:20mL and complications: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo>: 0:1:0:0, leakage: 1:1:3:0, neurological disturbance: 2:1:0:0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Instruction by authorized technical experts of JSES is helpful to avoid pitfalls which are not seen in open surgery without an expert </plain></SENT>
