<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This work was aimed at studying the clinical relevance of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative serum levels of VEGF and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immuno-assay in 35 CRC patients and in 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> had significantly higher VEGF and IL-6 levels than healthy controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with advanced clinical stage had significantly higher levels of VEGF and IL-6 than those with early clinical stage (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> had significantly higher VEGF and IL-6 levels than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy for invasiveness was 83% for VEGF (cut off value = 240 pg/ml) and 66% for IL-6 (cut off value = 6.7 pg/ml), with sensitivity 79% and 74% and specificity 68% and 59%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, preoperative measurement of serum VEGF and Il-6 may prove useful non-invasive diagnostic indicators associated with advanced clinical stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor metastasis</z:e> that warrants further investigations </plain></SENT>
