<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to explore the expression and its prognostic significance in comparison with various clinicopathological predictors of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: GABARAP protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in 103 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was scored semiquantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were analyzed in correlation with various clinicopathological variables, including patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of GABARAP was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> than that in adjacent matched nontumor tissues (51.5% vs 33.0%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of GABARAP expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> was significantly correlated with a low grade of differentiation and shortened overall survival (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the expression of GABARAP and age, gender, stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, and lymph node invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that GABARAP is frequently expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of GABARAP is a new independent prognostic marker, which is associated with poor differentiation as well as shortened overall survival </plain></SENT>
