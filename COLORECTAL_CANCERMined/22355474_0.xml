<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited data are available on knowledge and barriers in regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening tests in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to characterize knowledge, practice, and barriers toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its screening tests among an Iranian at-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with participation of 200 individuals of both genders aged 50 years or older in a teaching hospital in Tehran, Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected via face-to-face interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire containing demographics; knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening tests; screening practice; and reasons for not being screened was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reliability alpha for knowledge items was 0.52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age of the participants ranged from 50 to 83 years (mean 60.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 11% of the respondents reported prior screening by either fecal occult blood test (6.5%) or colonoscopy (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of individuals had poor knowledge although respondents with prior screening obtained slightly higher score in comparison with nonparticipants in screening (26.74 vs. 23.24; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four commonly cited reasons for not having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tests were "doctor did not recommend the test," "did not think it was needed," "never think of the test," and "no symptoms/problems" which were reported by 29%, 26%, 20%, and 17% of the participants, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is necessary to design appropriate educational interventions to increase the general population's knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening before implementing preventive programs in Iran </plain></SENT>
