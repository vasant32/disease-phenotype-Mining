<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,627 participants in the Australasian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Family Registry study were classified into two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk categories, according to the strength of their family history of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated the proportion of participants that adhered to national <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines by age group and for each familial risk category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We carried out a multinomial logistic regression analysis to evaluate the associations between screening and sociodemographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 1,236 participants at moderately increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 70 (6%) reported having undergone guideline-defined "appropriate" screening, 251 (20%) reported some, but less than appropriate screening, and 915 (74%) reported never having had any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 392 participants at potentially high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, three (1%) reported appropriate screening, 140 (36%) reported some, but less than appropriate screening, and 249 (64%) reported never having had any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On average, those of middle age, higher education, and who had resided in Australia longer were more likely to have had screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The uptake of recommended screening by unaffected people at the highest familial risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is extremely low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening are not being implemented in the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More research is needed to identify the reasons so as to enable development of strategies to improve participation in screening </plain></SENT>
