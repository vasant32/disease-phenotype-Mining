<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, uncertainty remains on the exact dose-risk and duration-risk relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified studies by searching several English and Chinese electronic databases and reviewing relevant articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose-response meta-analysis was performed by linear trend regression and restricted cubic spline regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was calculated as Q statistic and I(2) value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and quantified by the Begg's and Egger's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An inverse association between aspirin use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was observed in both the overall group (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.64-0.83 for aspirin dose; RR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.75-0.85 for frequency of aspirin use; RR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.81 for years of aspirin use) and subgroups stratified by sex and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The dose-response meta-analysis showed that there was a 20% statistically significant decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> for 325 mg aspirin per day increment, 18% decreased risk for 7 times aspirin per week increment and 18% decreased risk for 10 years aspirin increment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term (&gt;5 years), low-dose (75-325 mg per day) and regular aspirin use (2-7 times per week) can effectively reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
