<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Promoter hypermethylation and subsequent silencing of transcription factors can lead to further deregulation of their targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the potential epigenetic deregulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of Ikaros family genes, which code for essential transcription factors in cell differentiation and exhibit genetic defects in hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, our analysis revealed that Ikaros undergoes very specific promoter hypermethylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, including in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell lines studied and around 64% of primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, with increasing proportions in advanced Duke's stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ikaros hypermethylation occurred in the context of a novel long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reintroduction of Ikaros in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, ChIP-chip analysis, and validation in primary samples led us to identify a number of direct targets that are possibly related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results not only provide the first evidence that LRES can have functional specific effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> but also identify several deregulated Ikaros targets that may contribute to progression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
