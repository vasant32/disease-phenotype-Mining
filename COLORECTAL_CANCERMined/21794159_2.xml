<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this investigation we aim at assessing the diversities of short-term and medium-term clinical outcomes of laparoscopic-assisted versus open surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total number of 519 patients with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent either laparoscopic-assisted surgery (LAP) (n = 254) or open surgery (OP) (n = 265) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical techniques, perioperative managements and clinical follow-ups were standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short-term perioperative data and medium-term recurrence and survival were compared and analyzed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in perioperative parameters between the two groups except in regards to a trend of faster recovery in laparoscopic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative complications, reoperation rate, or perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences in a faster return of gastrointestinal function and shorter hospital stay were identified in favor of laparoscopic-assisted resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> cases separately, the overall survival, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free survival and recurrence rate were similar in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was also no tendency of significant differences in overall survival, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free survival and recurrence in stage I-II and stage III patients in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> categories between the two groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>pT, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and clinical stage were independent predictors of overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk, while pT, pN, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and clinical stage were found to be the independent predictors of recurrence risk in enrolled patients database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted procedure has more benefits on postoperative recovery, while has the same effects on medium-term recurrence and survival compared with open surgery in the treatment of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
