<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This retrospective study evaluated the outcome of adjuvant chemotherapy comprising modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) after potentially curative metastasectomy from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent potentially curative metastatectomy without any prior chemotherapy between December 2003 and November 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient background, type of adjuvant chemotherapy, and prognosis were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 30 patients (mFOLFOX6, n=26; oral fluoropyrimidines, n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median relapse-free survival tended to be longer in patients treated with mFOLFOX6 compared to those treated with fluoropyrimidines (28.5 months vs 14.8 months; p=0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (37.9 months vs 31.3 months, p=0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the analysis was restricted to patients treated with mFOLFOX6, no significant differences were found in relapse-free survival (p=0.46), overall survival (p=0.29), and frequency of adverse events during chemotherapy(Grade 3, p=0.32) between patients with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>(n=11) and those with metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that mFOLFOX6 might contribute to prolonging the time to relapse and that the timing of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>(synchronously or metachronously) may not have any effect on the outcome of adjuvant mFOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
