<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> possesses anticancer potential via caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether paraptosis, a type of the caspase-independent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, is also induced by <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V/PI, PI/RNase or H2DCFDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed morphological changes by crystal violet staining assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling was measured by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activation of NF-κB was measured by luciferase reporter assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At comparable concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> induced more cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines HCT-116 and SW-480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> induced paraptosis in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximides</z:chebi>, cytoplasmic vacuole generation was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The paraptotic induction effect of <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> was also supported by the results of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> induced ROS production in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, which activated the NF-κB pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Blockage of ROS by NAC or PS-1145 inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in part by induction of paraptosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The anticancer activity of <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> may be enhanced by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> such as green tea, which also inhibit the activation of NF-κB signaling </plain></SENT>
