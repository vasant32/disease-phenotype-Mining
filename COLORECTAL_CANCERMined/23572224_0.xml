<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic intestinal surgery is the preferable technique for the majority of intestinal surgical disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no series on laparoscopic resection of intestinal midgut <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid tumors</z:hpo> (MCTs) has been reported to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is related to the rarity of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> as well as the technical difficulties resecting the large mesenteric root <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0746921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymph node mass</z:e> commonly found with these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and the occasional difficulty identifying the primary MCT, which may be small and undetected on preoperative imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first series to report the results for laparoscopic resection of MCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients with MCT (excluding appendiceal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid tumor</z:hpo>) between 2002 and 2012 underwent laparoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's clinical data, preoperative <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> workup, imaging studies, operative data, final histology, and outcome were recorded and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 35 patients underwent surgery for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0006723'>intestinal carcinoid</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 35 patients, 20 (12 women and 8 men ages 26-86 years) had surgery for primary MCT, and the remainder had a colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the MCT group, ten patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three patients, multiple synchronous MCTs were detected intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent a laparoscopic resection with en bloc resection of the corresponding mesenteric root mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No conversion to open surgery was needed, and no major morbidity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients (10 %) each experienced minor morbidity with wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median hospital length of stay was 6 days (range 4-9 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up period of 3-96 months, no patients experienced local or regional recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were detected during the follow-up period in any patients who had surgery with intent to cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although technically difficult, laparoscopic resection of primary MCTs is feasible and safe, with the additional known significant advantages of laparoscopic surgery in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Similar to the large-scale prospective studies that proved the oncologic safety of laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, this small series showed that the laparoscopic technique also may be oncologically safe for these rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
