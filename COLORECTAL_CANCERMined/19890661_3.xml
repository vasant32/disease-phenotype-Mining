<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, endoglin was proposed as a marker of neovascularization in solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the VEGF and endoglin expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients, as well as to correlate the VEGF and endoglin expression with standard parameters, to define their potential prognostic role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VEGF and endoglin expression were evaluated in 99 unrelated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular endothelial growth factor and endoglobin expression were positively interrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation of VEGF and endoglin expression with clinicopathological parameters was observed in our cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier survival curves have demonstrated a clear association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific overall survival with high VEGF, as well as high endoglin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results support that VEGF and endoglin act as two valuable indicators of prognosis </plain></SENT>
