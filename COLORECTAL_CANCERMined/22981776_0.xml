<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The number of biological agents (BAs) registered with an indication related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment is flourishing and the cost of these treatments is rising dramatically, making the situation potentially unsustainable for healthcare systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we focus on the examples of bevacizumab (BV) and cetuximab (CX), two BAs approved for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first clinical trials show an increase in median overall survival of a few months, though these results could not always be repeated in subsequent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed full economic evaluations (FEEs) on BV or CX and despite frequently arguable estimates based on indirect efficacy, only one estimated the addition of CX was cost-effective in a virtual subgroup of patients, albeit with flawed methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most Western European countries reimburse BV and CX for mCRC, though clinical evidence seems weak and economic evidence even absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The underlying question is whether national health authorities are prepared to spend an increasing share of healthcare budgets on very expensive end-of-life treatments, their impact on life expectancy (a few additional months at best) and QoL (enhanced mainly by patients' hopes) being doubtful and their cost-effectiveness hardly ever proved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to explore how ethics could be included and thus assessed under these circumstances </plain></SENT>
