<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Anticancer drugs often show a narrow therapeutic index and high inter-patient variability, which can lead to the need to adjust doses individually during the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One approach to doing this is to use individual model predictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such methods have been proposed to target-specific drug concentrations or blood cell count, both of which are continuous variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, many toxic effects are evaluated on a categorical scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article presents a novel approach to dose adjustments for reducing a graded toxicity while maintaining efficacy, applied to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852711" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-and-foot syndrome</z:e> (HFS) induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mixed-effects proportional odds Markov model relating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> doses to HFS grades was individually adjusted at the end of each treatment cycle (3 weeks) by estimating subject-specific parameters by Bayesian MAP technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was then used to predict the risk of intolerable (grade ≥ 2) toxicity over the next treatment cycle and determine the next dose accordingly, targeting a predefined tolerable risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proof of concept was given by simulating virtual clinical trials, where the standard dose reductions and the prediction-based adaptations were compared, and where the therapeutic effect was simulated using a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> inhibition model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test various specifications of prediction-based adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individualized dose adaptation might reduce the average duration of intolerable HFS by 10 days as compared to the standard reductions (3.8 weeks vs. 5.2 weeks; 27% relative reduction) without compromising antitumor efficacy (both responder rates were 49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A clinical trial comparing the two methods should include 350 patients per arm to achieve at least 90% power to show a difference in grade ≥2 HFS duration at an alpha level of 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that individual prediction-based dose adaptation based on ordinal data may be feasible and beneficial </plain></SENT>
