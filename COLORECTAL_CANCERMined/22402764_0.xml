<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the progress in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> treatment, relapse is still a major obstacle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, new drugs or drug combinations are required in the battle against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>. α-Mangostin and betulinic acid (BA) are cytotoxic compounds that work by inducing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> is one of the most potent broad spectrum anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to investigate the enhancement of BA cytotoxicity by α-mangostin, and the cytoprotection effect of α-mangostin and BA on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity on HCT 116 human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity was investigated by the XTT cell proliferation test, and the apoptotic effects were investigated on early and late markers including caspases-3/7, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, cytoplasmic shrinkage, and chromatin condensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of α-mangostin on four signalling pathways was also investigated by the luciferase assay. α-Mangostin and BA were more cytotoxic to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells than to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic cells, and both compounds showed a cytoprotective effect against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, α-mangostin enhanced the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy hits multiple targets, which may improve the overall response to the treatment, and may reduce the likelihood of developing drug resistance by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, α-mangostin and BA may provide a novel combination for the treatment of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cytoprotective effect of the compounds against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity may find applications as chemopreventive agents against carcinogens, irradiation and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, or to neutralize <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> side effects </plain></SENT>
