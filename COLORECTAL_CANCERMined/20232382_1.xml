<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCAs</z:chebi>) are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, we conducted a case-control study among enrollees of an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in relation to use of any antidepressant, SSRIs only or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCAs</z:chebi> only, among 649 cases and 656 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of any antidepressant was associated with a reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.5-0.9) </plain></SENT>
