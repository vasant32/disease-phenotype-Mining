<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy and polypectomy procedures have effectively reduced the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, competence in colonoscopy is an essential part of the education program for gastrointestinal (GI) trainees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, considerable training is required for the optimal performance of a colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study involved six colonoscopy trainees, three of whom used the cap whereas the others did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each trainee managed 100 cases of screening colonoscopy from beginning to end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cecal intubation success rate, cecal intubation time, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate, advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> detection rate were checked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of successful cecal intubation and the cecal intubation time were reviewed every 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cecal intubation rate was 80.7 % (242/300) in the cap group and 63.3 % (190/300) in the non-cap group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average cecal intubation time was 13.7 min in the cap group and 18.7 min in the non-cap group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis of these results suggested that the cap group had a significantly higher success rate (p &lt; 0.001) and a shorter cecal intubation time (p &lt; 0.001) than the non-cap group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the two groups did not differ significantly in the detection rate for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (45.3 vs 43 %; p = 0.565), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (26.3 vs 25 %; p = 0.709), advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (2.6 vs 0.6 %; p = 0.056), or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (5.3 vs 3 %; p = 0.153) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cap-assisted colonoscopies might help to increase the rate of cecal intubation success and shorten the cecal intubation time for GI trainees </plain></SENT>
