<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ASE of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (APC) is associated with pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether moderate variations in ASE of APC contribute to common forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyze germline ASE of APC in blood samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (cases, n = 53) and controls (n = 68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Means, medians, and variances of ASE were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variants in the APC gene region also were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of ASE differed significantly between groups; cases had significantly larger amounts of variance than controls (P = .0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> increased proportionally with the degree of deviation from the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for individuals with levels of ASE that deviated more than 1 standard deviation from the mean was 3.97 (95% confidence interval, 1.71-9.24; P = .001); for those with levels greater than 1.645 standard deviations, the odds ratio was 13.46 (95% confidence interval, 1.76-609.40; P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis revealed that a patient with a high level of ASE who did not have a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> carried a nonsense mutation in APC (p.Arg216X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genotype analysis of APC associated multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms with ASE values and/or variance among cases, but not controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cis variants, therefore, might account for some of the variance in ASE of APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> have a larger variance in germline levels of ASE in APC than controls; large distances from the mean ASE were associated with risk for common forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
