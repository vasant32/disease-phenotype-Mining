<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We previously found that the haplotypes of TNFRSF17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> on Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to investigate whether the polymorphisms in the TNFRSF17 gene are associated with susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotype analysis in the TNFRSF17 SNPs was performed by high-resolution melting and TaqMan probe analysis, and the genotype and allele frequencies of TNFRSF17 SNPs were compared between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The haplotype frequencies of TNFRSF17 for multiple loci were estimated using the expectation maximization algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although, the genotype and allelic frequencies of these SNPs, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients, were not significantly different from those in the healthy controls, the genotype and allele frequency of g.2493G&gt;A was significantly different between the healthy controls and the right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients (P = 0.014 and 0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the haplotypes frequencies in the healthy controls were significantly different from those in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TNFRSF17 may be a candidate gene associated with the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and the haplotypes of the TNFRSF17 polymorphisms might be one of the markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
