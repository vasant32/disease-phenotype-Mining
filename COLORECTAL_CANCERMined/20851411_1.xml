<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its exact biological mechanism remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of fascin-1 expression with the clinicopathologic parameters and its prognostic impact in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The immunohistochemical stainings for fascin-1, β-catenin, and Ki-67 labeling index were performed with 126 stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fascin-1 was found to be expressed in 74 (58.7%) of the 126 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rate was significantly low, whereas the distant recurrence rate was significantly high in patients with fascin-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between fascin-1 expression and clinicopathologic factors such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, pathologic stage, β-catenin expression, and Ki-67 labeling index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, fascin-1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with N1 showed no significant difference in 5-y DFS and OS according to the fascin-1 expression (79.0% versus 60.5%, P = 0.113; 86.5% versus 78.8%, P = 0.566) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with N2 showed marginal difference in 5-y DFS and significant difference in 5-y OS according to the fascin-1 expression (59.4% versus 32.4%, P = 0.088; 81.2% versus 39.5%, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that fascin-1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may be clinically useful in predicting distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and poor survival, and we demonstrated that fascin-1 expression and N stage are significant independent prognostic factors for survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
