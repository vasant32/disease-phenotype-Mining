<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After almost 30 years, the available evidences have confirmed the appropriateness and usefulness of determining CA 19-9 levels as a prognostic indicator and as a reliable tool for monitoring pancreatic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e>, but concerns have been raised about its applications in screening, which is actually not recommended, and in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, due to several interferences that limit the specificity and to the insufficient sensitivity of this marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper we aimed to review the basic concepts of CA 19-9 testing and its current applications, with a major focus on the most recent evidences dealing with assay interference, methods comparison and monitoring of malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value and monitoring recommendations for pancreatic, gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are described in depth </plain></SENT>
