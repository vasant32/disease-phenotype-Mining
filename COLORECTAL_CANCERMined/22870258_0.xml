<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between CT measured parameters of body composition and the systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in patients with primary operable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENT AND METHODS: 174 patients with primary operable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent resection with curative intent (2003-2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Image analysis of CT scans was used to measure total fat index (cm(2)/m(2)), subcutaneous fat index (cm(2)/m(2)), visceral fat index (cm(2)/m(2)) and skeletal muscle index (cm(2)/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> was measured by serum white cell count (WCC), neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no relationships between any parameter of body composition and serum WCC or NLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant relationship between low skeletal muscle index and an elevated systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, as measured by the mGPS (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by linear relationships between skeletal muscle index and both C-reactive protein (r = -0.21, p = 0.005) and albumin (r = 0.31, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between skeletal muscle index and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights a direct relationship between low levels of skeletal muscle and the presence of a systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in patients with primary operable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
