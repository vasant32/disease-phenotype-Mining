<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hepatic resection is a potentially curative option for patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> who are candidates for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the increasing availability of highly effective chemotherapy, surgery may be further advanced by the improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response and better long-term outcomes associated with its use in the perioperative setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A commentary about the optimal timing of chemotherapy from the currently available evidence was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There is evidence to suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> improves disease-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recent EORTC trial (40983) by Nordlinger and co-workers provides evidence for improved progression-free survival with the use of perioperative chemotherapy compared to surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both adjuvant and perioperative chemotherapy appear to be beneficial over surgery alone for resectable colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether one is superior over the other remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participation in ongoing trials to optimize the perioperative sequencing of chemotherapy would be important in identifying the optimal peri-surgical chemotherapy management of resectable colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
