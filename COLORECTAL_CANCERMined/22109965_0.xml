<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the relations of social support and caregiving stress with caregivers' depressive symptoms during the first year since the relative's diagnosis, as well as the role of ethnicity in such relations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-nine caregivers provided complete data at 2 months (T1), 6 months (T2), and 12 months (T3) after their relative's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics and caregiving experiences were measured at T1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were assessed at T1 through T3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Greater caregiving stress and lack of social support were significant predictors of greater depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adverse effect of caregiving stress was more pronounced among African American caregivers, whereas the beneficial effect of social support was more pronounced among White caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of both caregiving stress and lack of social support early in caregivership </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings also suggest that caregivers may benefit from programs tailored for their ethnicity </plain></SENT>
