<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: KRAS mutation testing is recommended for the discernment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who are unlikely to benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recently developed amplification refractory mutation-Scorpion system is becoming a standard method for KRAS mutant detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The feasibility and robustness of this system using DNA samples from clinically available formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA from macro-dissected 110 specimens was applied for the KRAS mutant detection using a commercial amplification refractory mutation-Scorpion system kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Success rate and mutant detection rate of the test were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Small intra- and inter-lot deviations of the testing kit and a good concordance among different real-time polymerase chain reaction systems suggested the reliability of the amplification refractory mutation-Scorpion system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Though one-third of the 110 samples that were tested did not contain a sufficient amount of DNA to detect a 1% concentration of mutant alleles, the mutant detection rate was not impaired using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA concentrated by macro-dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a higher amount of template DNA, which supposedly contained abundant interfering substances, prevented the detection of the exogenous control amplicons, resulting in a reduced success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusting the template amount according to the total DNA concentration might reduce the failure rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The amplification refractory mutation-Scorpion system with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimen-derived DNA samples exhibited an acceptable feasibility and robustness suitable for routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
