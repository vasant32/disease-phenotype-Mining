<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As an initial step toward the implementation of genomic-based medicine, we explored primary care patients' ideas about genomic testing for common complex diseases to help develop future patient education materials and interventions to communicate genomic risk information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a mixed-methods study with participants from a large primary care clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within four focus groups, we used a semi-structured discussion guide and administered brief pre- and post- discussion quantitative surveys to assess participants' interest, attitudes, and preferences related to testing and receipt of test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to the discussion, moderators presented a plain-language explanation of DNA and genetics, defined "SNP", and highlighted what is known and unknown about the risks associated with testing for SNPs related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the NVIVO 8 software package to analyze the transcripts from the focus group discussions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of participants (75 %) were "very" or "somewhat interested" in receiving information from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> SNP test, even after learning about and discussing the small and still clinically uncertain change in risk conferred by SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reported interest in testing was related to degree of risk conferred, personal risk factors, family history, possible implications for managing health /disease prevention and curiosity about genetic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most people (85 %) preferred that genetic information be delivered in person by a healthcare or genetics professional rather than through print materials or a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that patients may look to genetic counselors, physicians or other healthcare professionals as gatekeepers of predictive genomic risk information </plain></SENT>
