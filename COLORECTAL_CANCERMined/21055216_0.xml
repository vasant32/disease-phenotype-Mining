<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues were tested for K-ras mutations at codon 12 and codon 13 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by direct sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) followed by sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other 113 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues were tested for K-ras mutations at codon 12 and codon 13 using PCR-RFLP followed by sequence analysis only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation results were analyzed with the corresponding clinical pathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 40 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases, none of K-ras mutations at codon 12 and codon 13 was detected by PCR followed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, K-ras mutations were found in 11 cases (11/40, 27.5%) by PCR-RFLP followed by sequence analysis, including 8 cases at codon 12 and 3 cases at codon 13 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 153 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases, point mutations were detected by PCR-RFLP followed by sequence analysis in 58 cases (37.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Point mutations at codon 12 were found in 46 cases and 12 cases at codon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations with the highest frequency were Gâ†’A transitions (25/58, 43.1%) at codon 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was observed between mutations of K-ras and gender, invasive depth, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, number of invaded lymph nodes, distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and clinical stage (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mutation of oncogene K-ras at codon 12 and codon 13 was closely related with age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of K-ras mutation was significantly higher in younger patients and in patients with ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PCR-RFLP followed by sequence analysis is a rapid, simple, sensitive and low-cost method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is a suitable technology for detecting hot-spot mutations in the K-ras oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mutation of oncogene K-ras at codon 12 and codon 13 is a common molecular event in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, which might be related with age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
