<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited data exists in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> regarding clinical and oncologic outcomes, and the ideal operative approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe our experience in the management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and their outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study is a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> who underwent a colorectal operation between 1990 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> undergoing a colorectal operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features and long-term oncologic outcomes are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one patients were identified; their mean age was 53.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was 22.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (83%) were known to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> preoperatively; in 7 patients it was discovered on postoperative pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were in the proximal rectum, 19 in the mid rectum, and 13 in the distal rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most common operation performed was total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy (n = 21), followed by IPAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (n = 28, 68%) had stage I or II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Estimates of overall survival at 1 and 5 years were 83% and 62%, and, for disease-free survival, the estimates were 93% and 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Local and distant recurrence was seen in 5 and 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine percent of the observed recurrences were in patients with stage III and IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Pouch failure occurred in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This retrospective study was possibly underpowered, given the small sample sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our cohort, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was rare, often presented at an early stage, and was not always diagnosed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The presence of early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> should not be considered a contraindication for IPAA </plain></SENT>
