<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: Two-hundred <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens were collected for studies of K-Ras codon 12, 13 and 61, and BRAF codon 600 by polymerase chain reaction and direct nucleotide sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: The overall incidence of K-Ras mutations in our patients was 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>K-ras mutation frequencies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stages (AJCC) I, II, III and IV were 6.7%, 16.1%, 23.3% and 26.6%, respectively (p-value&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three most common mutation forms were G12D, G12V and G13D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>K-Ras mutation status was associated with poorer EFS in stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (p-value 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The study found a lower mutation frequency of K-Ras and BRAF compared to reports involving other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, K-Ras mutations did have a negative prognostic value in early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
