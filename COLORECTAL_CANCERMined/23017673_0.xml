<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This microbiota is considered to play a number of key roles in the maintenance of host health, including aiding digestion of otherwise indigestible dietary compounds, synthesis of vitamins and other beneficial metabolites, immune system regulation and enhanced resistance against colonisation by pathogenic microorganisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the intestinal microbiota is also a potent source of antigens and potentially harmful compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In health, humans can therefore be considered to exist in a state of natural balance with their microbial inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A shift in the balance of microbiota composition such that it may become deleterious to host health is termed "dysbiosis" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been implicated in numerous disorders, ranging from intestinal maladies such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to disorders with more systemic effects such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and atopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the far reaching influence of the intestinal microbiota on human health a clear future goal must be to develop reliable means to alter the composition of the microbiota and restore a healthy balance of microbial species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While it is clear that much fundamental research remains to be done, potentially important therapeutic options include narrow spectrum antibiotics, novel probiotics, dietary interventions and more radical techniques such as faecal transplantation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which aim to suppress clinical dysbiosis, restore intestinal microbiota diversity and improve host health </plain></SENT>
