<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objective: To identify changes in peripheral immune responses in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with irinotecan/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin (IFL) alone or in combination with cetuximab (C-IFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from healthy donors (n = 20) and patients with mCRC receiving treatment with either IFL (n = 30) or C-IFL (n = 30) were tested for cytokine production upon polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, T cell proliferation in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (auto-MLR) and T regulatory cell (Treg) frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The respective results were evaluated over two treatment cycles and further assessed in relation to response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: PBMCs prior to treatment exhibited significantly lower production of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-18 cytokines and lower auto-MLR responses, whereas Treg frequency, IL-4, IL-10 cytokines were increased compared to healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During treatment, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-18 and auto-MLR responses increased, while Treg frequency and IL-10 secretion decreased significantly compared to the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responders to treatment exhibited a significantly higher increase in IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-18 production and auto-MLR responses, and higher decrease in IL-4, IL-10 secretion and Treg frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient subgroups analysed, responders to C-IFL demonstrated significantly higher increase in auto-MLR responses, IL-12 and IL-18 secretion and higher decrease in Treg frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The disturbed immune parameters observed in patients with mCRC at presentation can be significantly improved during treatment with IFL and this effect can be potentiated by the addition of cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of the peripheral immune system function could be used as surrogate marker in predicting treatment-related outcome </plain></SENT>
