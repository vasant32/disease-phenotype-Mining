<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few previous studies concentrated on the predictive role of Notch1 expression on the overall survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explored expression of Notch1 and its relationship with p65 and prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two independent study cohorts were involved in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical specimens from 941 eligible patients were constructed into tissue microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of Notch1 and p65 protein was investigated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant positive correlations were found between protein expression of Notch1 and p65 in both retrospective and prospective study cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher Notch1 expression showed a trend of having shorter survival time, whereas patients with lower Notch1 expression had better survival in both study cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, Notch1 expression was proven to be an independent predictor of prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the prognostic value of Notch1 might differ according to p65 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Notch1 is an independent predictor of prognosis for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the predictive role of Notch1 on clinical outcome might be modified by p65 status, suggesting that targeting Notch1 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) might be a promising strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
