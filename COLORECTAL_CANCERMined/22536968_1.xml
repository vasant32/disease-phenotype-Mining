<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is known from recent studies that more than 90% of human multi-exon genes are subject to Alternative Splicing (AS), a key molecular mechanism in which multiple transcripts may be generated from a single gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is widely recognized that a breakdown in AS mechanisms plays an important role in cellular differentiation and pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase Chain Reactions, microarrays and sequencing technologies have been applied to the study of transcript diversity arising from alternative expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Last generation Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays offer a more detailed view of the gene expression profile providing information on the AS patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exon array technology, with more than five million data points, can detect approximately one million exons, and it allows performing analyses at both gene and exon level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper we describe BEAT, an integrated user-friendly bioinformatics framework to store, analyze and visualize exon arrays datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It combines a data warehouse approach with some rigorous statistical methods for assessing the AS of genes involved in diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meta statistics are proposed as a novel approach to explore the analysis results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BEAT is available at http://beat.ba.itb.cnr.it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BEAT is a web tool which allows uploading and analyzing exon array datasets using standard statistical methods and an easy-to-use graphical web front-end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BEAT has been tested on a dataset with 173 samples and tuned using new datasets of exon array experiments from 28 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and 26 renal cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples produced at the Medical Genetics Unit of IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza.To highlight <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible AS events, alternative names, accession Ids, Gene Ontology terms and biochemical pathways annotations are integrated with exon and gene level expression plots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The user can customize the results choosing custom thresholds for the statistical parameters and exploiting the available clinical data of the samples for a multivariate AS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite exon array chips being widely used for transcriptomics studies, there is a lack of analysis tools offering advanced statistical features and requiring no programming knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BEAT provides a user-friendly platform for a comprehensive study of AS events in human diseases, displaying the analysis results with easily interpretable and interactive tables and graphics </plain></SENT>
