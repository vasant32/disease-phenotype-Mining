<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As these techniques improve, their sensitivity to detect malignant lesions is increasing; however, detection of precursor lesions remains problematic and has generated a lack of general acceptance for their widespread usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early detection by an accurate, noninvasive, cost-effective, simple-to-use screening technique is central to decreasing the incidence and mortality of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in the development of molecular markers in faecal specimens are encouraging for its use as a screening tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations that result from the carcinogenetic process can be detected by coprocytobiology in the colonocytes exfoliated from the lesion into the fecal matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These markers have shown promising sensitivity and specificity in the detection of both malignant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> and are gaining popularity as a noninvasive technique that is representative of the entire colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we summarize the genetic and epigenetic fecal molecular markers that have been identified as potential targets in the screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
