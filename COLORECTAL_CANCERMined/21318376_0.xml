<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CTC is a sensitive and specific method of detecting colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, several factors have limited its clinical availability, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines have issued conflicting recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY: A web-based survey was administered to physicians at two institutions with and without routine CTC availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 398 of 1655 (24%) participants completed the survey, 59% was from the institution with routine CTC availability, 52% self-identified as trainees, and 15% as gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>78% had no personal experience with CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 12% was aware of any current <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines that included CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multiple regression model, gastroenterologists had greater odds of being aware of guidelines (OR 3.49, CI 1.67-7.26), as did physicians with prior CTC experience (OR 4.81, CI 2.39-9.68), controlling for institution, level of training, sex, and practice type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on guidelines that recommend CTC, when given a clinical scenario, 96% of physicians was unable to select the appropriate follow-up after a CTC, which was unaffected by institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most physicians have limited experience with CTC and are unaware of recent recommendations concerning CTC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
