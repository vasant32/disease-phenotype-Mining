<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The population of Germany is aging, i.e., the elderly currently make up an increasing percentage of the population from year to year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, many common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases mainly affect the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For these two reasons, the overall cost of health care in Germany is expected to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect that population aging has had on the number of hospitalizations for major types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease in Germany since the year 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is based on nationwide hospitalization statistics, classified by diagnosis, that were published by the German Federal Statistical Office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data for three classes of diagnoses--malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263660" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue</z:e>--which were further broken down into nine diagnostic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in inpatient case numbers might be due either to population aging or to changing rates of hospitalization for individual diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We used index decomposition analysis to determine the relative influence of these two factors on changing case numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The author found that the aging of the population increased the number of hospitalizations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the diagnoses studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was particularly evident with respect to the large birth cohorts born in the 1920s (with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>) and in the period 1934-1944 (with the diagnoses <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, changing rates of hospitalization for individual diagnoses increased the number of hospitalizations for some diagnoses (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, diseases of the spine and back) and decreased it for others (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, cerebrovascular diseases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The aging of the population and the changing rates of hospitalization for various diagnoses are exerting separate effects on the number of hospitalizations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Predictions of hospital case numbers in the future must take both factors into account </plain></SENT>
