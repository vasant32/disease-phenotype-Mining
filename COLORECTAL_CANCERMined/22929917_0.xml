<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>COX-2 polymorphisms -765G&gt;C may play a role in carcinogenic processes in combination with specific life-style conditions or dependent on the racial composition of a particular population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If mutational events play an important role in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> sequence, one can hypothesize that modification of these events by life-style or other factors would be a useful prevention strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM OF WORK: To explore the association between K-ras mutation and potential variables known or suspected to be related to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) as well as determining the possible modulating effect of the COX-2 polymorphism, -765G&gt;C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 80 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from Tropical Medicine and Gastrointestinal Tract endoscopy Departments and those attending clinic of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute, Cairo University during the period extending from April 2009 to March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Full history taking with emphasis on the risk factors of interest, namely age, sex, family history, smoking and dietary history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum CEA and CA19-9, RBCs <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and occult blood in stool were done to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>K-ras protooncogene mutation at codon 12 (exon 1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) -765G&gt;C polymorphism were determined by PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The K-ras mutation was positive in 23 (28.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>COX-2 polymorphism revealed GG in 62.5%, GC in 26.2 % and CC genotype was found in 11.3 % of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean red blood cell <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> level was lower in the K-ras positive group (100.96±51.3ng/ml) than the negative group (216.6±166.4ng/ml), (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Higher <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels were found in males than females (median=173ng/ml and 85ng/ml; respectively, P=0.002) with adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only, the RBCs <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> (P=0.0018) followed by gender (P=0.036) contributed significantly in the discrimination between patients prone to develop K-ras mutation and those who are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RBC <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> was significantly deficient in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) patients with K-ras mutations in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients free of the mutations, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> may be a risk factor for K-ras mutation development </plain></SENT>
