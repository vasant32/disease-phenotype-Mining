<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, deregulation of the process of translation initiation appears to play a key role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is vital for cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and thus an attractive therapeutic target in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, several mTOR inhibitors are currently being tested in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: In this review, the key components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, their molecular alterations and the inhibitors targeting the mTOR pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complex interactions with other pathways such as the MAPK pathway are analyzed, as are possible drug combinations that target this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, novel strategies for use of mTOR pathway inhibitors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment are introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors have been investigated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>mTOR inhibitors may represent an attractive antitumor target in combination with strategies to target other pathways that may overcome resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to identify critical molecular effector mechanisms, molecular markers that predict responsiveness and potential toxicities </plain></SENT>
