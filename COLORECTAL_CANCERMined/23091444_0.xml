<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to identify clinical and pathological parameters that may be helpful in selection of patients with MSI-high (MSI-H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were enrolled retrospectively for this MSI study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and/or real time PCR methods with five markers and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MLH1 and MSH2 were performed for analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and blood specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinico-pathologic parameters, including IHC, were investigated in order to determine their usefulness as predictive factors of MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 120 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, MSI was observed in 15 cases (12.5%), including 11 cases of MSI-H and four cases of MSI-low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with MSI were younger, less than 50 years old, had a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, Rt. sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and/or synchronous multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, mucinous histologic type, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen group in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of multivariate analysis showed Bethesda guidelines, Rt. sided and/or synchronous multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and negative expression of IHC for MLH1, which was consistently associated with MSI-H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> have met at least one of these three parameters and their sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 72.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bethesda guidelines, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, and negative expression of MLH1 protein are important parameters for selection of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> for MSI testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MSI testing is recommended for patients showing any of these three parameters </plain></SENT>
