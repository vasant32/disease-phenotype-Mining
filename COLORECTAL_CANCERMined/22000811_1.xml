<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Molecular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> profiling is a new method of identifying the tissue of origin in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of unknown primary (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CUP</z:e>) site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However the value of this information in improving treatment outcomes is undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated results of site-specific treatment in a group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CUP</z:e> in whom molecular profiling predicted a colorectal site of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tissue of origin predictions by a 92-gene real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) molecular profiling assay (CancerTYPE ID; bioTheranostics, Inc, San Diego, CA) from March 2008 to August 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-five of 1544 patients (8%) assayed were predicted to have a colorectal tissue of origin with &gt; 80% probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surveys were sent to the physicians of these 125 patients requesting deidentified patient information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Information was provided for 42 of 125 patients (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients received either first- or second-line therapy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> regimens; the overall response rate was 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who received first-line empirical therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CUP</z:e> had an overall response rate of 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival of patients who received site-specific therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 27 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients predicted to have a colorectal site of origin by molecular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> profiling had median survival when treated with site-specific regimens that was similar to survival in patients with known metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survival in this group was substantially better than the historical median survival for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CUP</z:e> (range 8-11 months) when treated with empirical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CUP</z:e> regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Molecular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> profiling seems to improve survival by allowing specific therapy in this patient subgroup; prospective trials are ongoing to confirm these observations </plain></SENT>
