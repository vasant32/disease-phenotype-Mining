<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent report comprehensively concluded that total energy intake does not have a simple relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, and that the data were inconsistent for carbohydrate, cholesterol and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to identify the associations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk with dietary intakes of total energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, and alcohol using data from a large case-control study conducted in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) and Ontario (ON), Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases (n = 1760) were identified from population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries in the provinces of ON (1997-2000) and NL (1999-2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls (n = 2481) were a random sample of residents in each province, aged 20-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family history questionnaire (FHQ), personal history questionnaire (PHQ), and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were used to collect study data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of intakes of total energy, macronutrients and alcohol with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total energy intake was associated with higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.21-2.01, p-trend = 0.02, 5th versus 1st quintile), whereas inverse associations emerged for intakes of protein (OR: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.69-1.00, p-trend = 0.06, 5th versus 1st quintile), carbohydrate (OR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.63-1.00, p-trend = 0.05, 5th versus 1st quintile) and total dietary fiber (OR: 0.84, 95% CI:0.67-0.99, p-trend = 0.04, 5th versus 1st quintile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total fat, alcohol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25413">monounsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, and cholesterol were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence that high energy intake may increase risk of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, whereas diets high in protein, fiber, and carbohydrate may reduce the risk of the disease </plain></SENT>
