<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We investigated in the first-line setting our previous finding that patients with chemorefractory KRAS G13D-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) benefit from cetuximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> KRAS mutation status (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, G13D, G12V, or other mutations) and progression-free survival (PFS), survival, and response were investigated in pooled data from 1,378 evaluable patients from the CRYSTAL and OPUS studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis correcting for differences in baseline prognostic factors was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 533 patients (39%) with KRAS-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 83 (16%) had G13D, 125 (23%) had G12V, and 325 (61%) had other mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant variations in treatment effects were found for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response (P = .005) and PFS (P = .046) in patients with G13D-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other mutations (including G12V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within KRAS mutation subgroups, cetuximab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone significantly improved PFS (median, 7.4 v 6.0 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; P = .039) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response (40.5% v 22.0%; odds ratio, 3.38; P = .042) but not survival (median, 15.4 v 14.7 months; HR, 0.89; P = .68) in patients with G13D-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with G12V and other mutations did not benefit from this treatment combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with KRAS G13D-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> receiving chemotherapy alone experienced worse outcomes (response, 22.0% v 43.2%; odds ratio, 0.40; P = .032) than those with other mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effects were similar in the separate CRYSTAL and OPUS studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy seems to benefit patients with KRAS G13D-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relative treatment effects were similar to those in patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> but with lower absolute values </plain></SENT>
