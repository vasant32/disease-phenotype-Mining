<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The identification of molecular and genetic markers to predict or monitor the efficacy of bevacizumab (BV) represents a key issue in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble VEGF receptor 2 (sVEGFR-2) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) were assessed by ELISA assay at different time points in a cohort of 25 patients enroled in a phase II trial of GONO-FOLFOXIRI plus BV as first-line treatment of mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VEGF: -2578A/C, -1498C/T, -1154A/G, -634C/G and 936C/T; and VEGFR-2: -604A/G, +1192C/T and +1719A/T, polymorphisms were assessed in a total of 54 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with GONO-FOLFOXIRI plus BV determined a prolonged and significant reduction in plasma free, biologically active VEGF concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, VEGF concentrations remained lower than at baseline also at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, PlGF levels increased during the treatment if compared with baseline, suggesting a possible role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> resistance; moreover, sVEGFR-2 increased at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, as well as TSP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association of assessed polymorphisms with outcome was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggested the possible mechanisms of resistance to combined therapy in those patients with a progressive disease to be tested in ongoing phase III randomised studies </plain></SENT>
