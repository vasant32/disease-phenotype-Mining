<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality has decreased over the last 20 years, it remains the third most common cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related mortality, accounting for approximately 600,000 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in 2008 worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A multitude of risk factors have been linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, including hereditary factors, environmental factors and inflammatory syndromes affecting the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, various pathogens were added to the growing list of risk factors for a number of common epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, but despite the multitude of correlative studies, only suggestions remain about the possible relationship between selected viruses and bacteria of interest and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
