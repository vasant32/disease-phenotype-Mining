<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, novel therapeutic approaches are badly needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the involvement of nuclear protein kinase CK2 α subunit (CK2α) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, and in the prognosis of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Expression levels of nuclear CK2α were analyzed in 245 colorectal tissues from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We correlated the expression levels with clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of nuclear CK2α was significantly correlated with depth of invasion, nodal status, American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (AJCC) staging, degree of differentiation, and perineural invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with high expression levels of nuclear CK2α had a significantly poorer overall survival rate compared with patients with low expression levels of nuclear CK2α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multi-variate Cox regression analysis, overexpression of nuclear CK2α was proven to be an independent prognostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, DLD-1 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells were employed as a cellular model to study the role of CK2α on cell growth, and the expression of CK2α in DLD-1 cells was inhibited by using siRNA technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data indicated that CK2α-specific siRNA treatment resulted in growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, overexpression of nuclear CK2α can be a useful marker for predicting the outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
