<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This multicenter phase II prospective study aims to investigate the activity of a retreatment with a cetuximab-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 39 irinotecan-refractory patients who had a clinical benefit after a line of cetuximab- plus irinotecan-based therapy and then a progression of disease for which underwent a new line chemotherapy and finally, after a clear new progression of disease, were retreated with the same cetuximab- plus irinotecan-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median number of therapeutic lines before accrual was 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median interval time between last cycle of first cetuximab-based therapy and first cycle of the retreatment was 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate was 53.8% with 19 partial responses (48.7%) and 2 complete responses (5.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease stabilization was obtained in 35.9% of patients and progression in four patients (10.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 6.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> during first cetuximab therapy and during cetuximab rechallenge was significant (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rechallenge with the same cetuximab-based therapy may achieve a new important clinical benefit further delaying the progression of disease and improving the therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
