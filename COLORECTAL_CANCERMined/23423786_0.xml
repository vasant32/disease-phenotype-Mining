<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High levels of GATA2 expression are correlated with poor survival outcomes in many types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the expression and prognostic significance of GATA2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, GATA2 protein expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in 307 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues, and its association with clinicopathological features and prognosis was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of GATA2 was found to be significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues than in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues (60.3 vs. 9.0 %, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of GATA2 was significantly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (P = 0.005), histological type (P = 0.019), and recurrence (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with high levels of GATA2 expression had worse disease-free survival outcomes than those with low levels of GATA2 expression (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed high levels of GATA2 expression to be significantly associated with shorter periods of disease-free survival (HR 2.196; 95 % CI 1.142-4.226; P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed GATA2 expression to be an independent prognostic factor for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HR 1.952; 95 % CI 1.010-3.775; P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that high levels of GATA2 expression may be a useful indicator of disease recurrence after curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
