<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The number of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated by chemotherapy without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection has recently increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> response by computed tomography is difficult in such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the usefulness of evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> response to chemotherapy by endoscopy was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective analysis was performed at the Shizuoka <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center and included 31 patients (88 evaluations) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and endoscopy were performed concomitantly between September 2002 and June 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated by systemic chemotherapy without prophylactic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Definitions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> response were as follows: (1) complete response, confirmed by colorectal biopsy; (2) progressive disease, enlargement of at least one of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> parameters; and (3) neither (1) nor (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography was performed to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> and to identify colorectal stenosis secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of concordance between endoscopy and computed tomography for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> response was 75Â % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colorectal stenosis was detected 14 times by endoscopy (9 cases) and 3 times by computed tomography (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 7 patients in whom surgery was required, 6 exhibited stenotic symptoms before endoscopic detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> response evaluation, a high concordance rate was observed between endoscopy and computed tomography, although endoscopic evaluation appeared more sensitive in detecting colorectal stenosis requiring surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
