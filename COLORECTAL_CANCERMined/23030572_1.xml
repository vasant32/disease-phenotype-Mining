<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Instead of readability formulas, the present study focused on text cohesion, which is the degree to which the text content ties together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of text cohesion on reading times, comprehension, and retention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prevention information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>English-speaking adults (50 years of age or older) were recruited from local communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to read <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prevention subtopics presented at 2 levels of text cohesion: from higher cohesion to lower cohesion, or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reading times, word recognition, text comprehension, and recall were assessed after reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later, text comprehension and recall were reassessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-two adults completed the study, but five were lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher text cohesion showed a significant effect on reading times and text comprehension but not on word recognition and recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of text cohesion was not found on text comprehension and recall after 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing text cohesion facilitates reading speed and comprehension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prevention information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further research on the effect of text cohesion is warranted </plain></SENT>
