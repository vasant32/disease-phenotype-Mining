<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Medical Center from March 2009 to March 2011 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> lesions in rectum, distal and proximal colon were 51.8% (58/112), 26.8% (30/112) and 21.4% (24/112), respectively; which was not different from that in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> group (χ2, p=0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rates for poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were also not significantly different between the two groups: 12.4% (14/112) versus 8.3% (24/288) (χ2, p=0.25) </plain></SENT>
