<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the genotype distribution of the XRCC1 gene in 130 CRC cases in comparison with that of 150 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no direct significant association between the XRCC1 genotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; however, the Arg/Gln genotype was associated with an elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR&gt;1.47) and the Gln/Gln variant genotype was associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in various clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the XRCC1 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
