<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the antitumor effect of DCA combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines were treated with DCA or 5-FU, or a combination of DCA and 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell viability was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interaction between DCA and 5-FU was evaluated by the median effect principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was carried out to determine the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were measured by flow cytometry, and the expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related molecules was assessed by western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that DCA inhibited the viability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and had synergistic antiproliferation in combination with 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, compared with 5-FU alone, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells treated with DCA and 5-FU was enhanced and demonstrated with the changes of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that DCA has a synergistic antitumor effect with 5-FU on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
