<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective here is to assess the gender-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> spatio-temporal pattern in the health areas of Navarre, a Spanish province, during the period 1990-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For each gender, a model with spatio-temporal CAR (Conditional Autoregressive) distributions is used for smoothing the incidence risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Smoothing is carried out in two dimensions: space and time, allowing for a different time evolution in each health area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An estimated incidence trend curve for each health area and the corresponding confidence bands are obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To analyze the evolution of the geographical patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence risks, maps are also provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both genders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> shows an increasing trend in most of the areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second half of the period 1998-2005 most of the areas have risks above one although not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In general females present equal or lower risks than males in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas during the studied period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence risk is still increasing in the health areas of Navarre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Promoting healthful lifestyles for primary prevention and early detection programs could help to reverse the trend in the province </plain></SENT>
