<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied possible associations between bevacizumab-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and gene polymorphisms to assure safer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 60 Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who had received bevacizumab-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined for five well-known functional single-nucleotide polymorphism of the VEGF gene at positions C-2578A, T-1498C, G-1154A, G-634C, and C936T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was graded according to CTCAE v4.0 on the basis of home blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The VEGF-2578 C/C and -1498 T/T genotypes were associated with significantly less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during the first 2 months of bevacizumab-based chemotherapy (p = 0.004, p = 0.025, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the treatment period as a whole, the VEGF-2578 C/C and 936 C/C genotypes were associated with less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.031, p = 0.043, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was not associated with bevacizumab-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a significant relation between a lower incidence of grade 2 or higher bevacizumab-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and the VEGF-2578 C/C genotype for the entire treatment period in Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This genotype might be useful for ensuring safer treatment of patients who receive bevacizumab-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
