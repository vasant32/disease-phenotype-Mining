<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system development commonly up- or down-regulated among groups treated with anti-thyroid agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical distributions of vimentin, Ret proto-oncogene (Ret), deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> protein (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>), and Claudin11 (Cld11) were examined based on the gene expression profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive cells for vimentin and Ret in the cingulum, and the immunoreactive intensity of Cld11 and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> in whole white matter were increased by treatment with anti-thyroid agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive cells for vimentin and Ret were immature astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, immunoreactive cells for vimentin and Ret may be quantitatively measurable targets of developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> in white matter </plain></SENT>
