<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted an exploratory retrospective analysis to identify baseline factors possibly predictive for a benefit of perioperative FOLFOX on PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The analysis was based on 237 events from 342 eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression models with a significance level of 0.1 were used to build up univariate and multivariate models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for identified prognostic factors, moderately (5.1-30 ng/mL) and highly (&gt;30 ng/mL) elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels were both predictive for the benefit of perioperative chemotherapy (interaction P = 0.07; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58 and HR = 0.52 for treatment benefit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients with moderately or highly elevated CEA (&gt;5 ng/mL), the 3-year PFS was 35% with perioperative chemotherapy compared to 20% with surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Performance status (PS) 0 and BMI lower than 30 were also predictive for the benefit of perioperative chemotherapy (interaction P = 0.04 and P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the number of patients with PS 1 and BMI 30 or higher were limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The benefit of perioperative therapy was not influenced by the number of metastatic lesions (1 vs 2-4, interaction HR = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative FOLFOX seems to benefit in particular patients with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> when CEA is elevated and when PS is unaffected, regardless of the number of metastatic lesions.ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00006479 </plain></SENT>
