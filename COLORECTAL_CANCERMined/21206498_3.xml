<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent research has shown that most of the excess risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in England compared with Norway and Sweden occurs in older age groups during the first year, and especially in the first month of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the characteristics of patients dying within 30 days of being diagnosed with one of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in Scotland during 2003-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anonymised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry records linked to hospital discharge and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> records were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population was divided into patients who died within 30 days of diagnosis (cases) and those who survived beyond this threshold (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in patient-, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-, and health service-related characteristics were assessed using the Ï‡(2)-test and logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients dying within 30 days were more likely to be elderly and to have experienced emergency admission to non-surgical specialities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were less likely to have been verified microscopically, but they appeared more likely to be of high grade and advanced in stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A substantial number of patients died from causes other than their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that early mortality after a diagnosis of breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may be partly due to comorbidity and lifestyle factors, as well as due to more advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research is required to determine the precise explanation for these findings and, in particular, if any potentially avoidable factors such as delays in presentation, referral, or diagnosis exist </plain></SENT>
