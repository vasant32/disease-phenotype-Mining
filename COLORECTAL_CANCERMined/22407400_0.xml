<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to determine selection criteria for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) who were likely to show survival benefits of metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinicopathological data of 119 patients with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> resection were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic factors were analyzed according to the disease resectability status, and patients likely to show survival benefits of metastasectomy were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Metastasectomy was performed in 63 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, R0 resection was reported in 55 patients, who comprised the curable group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other 64 patients comprised the noncurable group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the noncurable group, postoperative chemotherapy was identified as the only significant prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the curable group, T stage, histological type, elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level and the presence of extra <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e> were identified as independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients within the curable group were further classified into a low-risk group (zero to two prognostic factors) and a high-risk group (three or more prognostic factors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (OS) of the high risk patients in the curable group was as poor as that of the patients in the noncurable group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> populations who had different prognostic factors, stratified by the disease resectability status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No prognostic benefit of metastasectomy was observed in high-risk patients undergoing curative metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that patients showing survival benefits of metastasectomy can be identified by considering the prognostic factors in patients undergoing curative metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
