<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>184 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 91, the abdominal wall was closed with the Vicryl* Plus, and in 93 patients with Vicryl* </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics, biochemical inflammatory parameters, wound appearance, length of hospital stay, postoperative wound complications and post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Vicryl* Plus group there was a shorter hospital stay (13.2 +/- 1.3 days; 21.4 +/- 2.8 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Vicryl* Plus group inflammatory parameters decreased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within the first week whereas in the Vicryl* group remained increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the Vicryl* Plus group four patients had a wound discharge, seven had inflammatory reactions to the skin sutures </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the Vicryl* group 12 patients had an SSI, 14 patients had inflammatory reactions to the skin sutures and 7 patients had a wound dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Closure of the abdominal wall using Vicryl* Plus decreases postoperative wound complications, length of hospital stay and is associated with a more rapid return of inflammatory markers to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
