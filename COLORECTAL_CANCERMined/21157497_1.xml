<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genomic sequences encoding the 3' exonuclease (proofreading) domains of both replicative DNA polymerases, pol delta and pol epsilon, were explored simultaneously in human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> including six established cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three unequivocal sequence alterations, including one previously reported, were found, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these were considered as dysfunctional mutations in light of the local amino-acid sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the F367S mutation found in the POLE gene encoding the pol epsilon catalytic subunit, which includes the proofreading domain, is the first found in human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> carrying these proofreading domain mutations were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> defective in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the two cell lines with acknowledged MMR gene mutations, the third <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was also demonstrated to harbour a distinct mutation in MLH1, and indeed exhibited a microsatellite-unstable phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that, in concert with MMR deficiency, defective polymerase proofreading may also contribute to the mutator phenotype observed in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our observations may suggest previously unrecognised complexities in the molecular abnormalities underlying the mutator phenotype in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
