<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway correlated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221391" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melanosis coli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of Hh signaling pathway components (SHH, PTCH1, Gli1 and SUFU) in 127 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, 36 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221391" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melanosis coli</z:e> and 20 adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal tissues taken from surgical specimens were evaluated using antibody staining and qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, SHH and PTCH, but not Gli1 or SUFU, were weakly expressed and mainly in the epithelial lining of the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cancerous tissues, SHH and Gli1 was uniformly strong while that of PTCH1 was patchy and weak, and SUFU uniformly weak, which paralleled the levels of corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated protein levels of SHH and PTCH were significantly associated with mucinous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated SUFU protein levels were positively correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221391" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melanosis coli</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of SHH, PTCH1, Gli1 and SUFU were very low, which were similar to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues; but protein levels of SHH, PTCH1 and Gli1, but not SUFU, were high, which were similar to those of cancerous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hh pathway component <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels are aberrantly elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, which may be potentially useful as molecular classification markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221391" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melanosis coli</z:e> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
