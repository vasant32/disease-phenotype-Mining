<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased fatty acid synthase levels have been detected in serum from patients with breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, serum levels of fatty acid synthase were measured in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients at different stages of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive 67 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of fatty acid synthase were examined by ELISA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Kruskal-Wallis test and the Ï‡ (2) method for trend have been used to analyze data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum fatty acid synthase levels of patients belonging to three groups of stage disease are statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with stage III and IV have significantly higher serum levels of fatty acid synthase than patients with stage I-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a positive trend in serum fatty acid synthase levels from stage I-II to stage III and IV of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fatty acid synthase levels are associated with the stage of disease in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
