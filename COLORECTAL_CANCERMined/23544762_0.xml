<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening use but are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objectives: To examine geographic variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and the extent to which multilevel SDOH explain its use in California, the most populous and racially/ethnically diverse state in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study Design: Analysis of individual and neighborhood data on 20,626 adult respondents aged &gt;50 years from the 2005 California Health Interview Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods: We used multilevel logistic regression models to estimate the effects of individual characteristics and area-level segregation, socioeconomic status (SES), and healthcare resources at 2 different geographic levels on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: We confirmed that individual-level factors (eg, race/ethnicity, income, insurance) were strong predictors and found that area-level healthcare resources were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary care shortage in the Medical Service Study Area was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening for any modality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>County-level HMO penetration (OR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.47-2.33) and primary care shortage (OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-0.99) were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Contextual factors including locality, primary care resources, and HMO membership are important determinants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening uptake; SES and segregation did not explain variation in screening behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More studies of contextual factors and varying geographic scales are needed to further elucidate their impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening uptake </plain></SENT>
