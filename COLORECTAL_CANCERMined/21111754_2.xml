<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report examines mediators of change in the context of a randomized controlled intervention trial (Los Angeles, 2004-2009) that successfully increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening among Filipino Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The intervention, based on the Health Behavior Framework, targeted knowledge/awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, communication with health care provider, health beliefs, social support and barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Health Behavior Framework variables were assessed at baseline and 6-month follow-up (N=432) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variables targeted for change were tested as potential mediators of the primary outcome, self-reported receipt of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening during the follow-up period, which was previously found to have increased significantly among intervention participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consistent with the Health Behavior Framework, knowledge/awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and patient-provider communication mediated receipt of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increase in knowledge/awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening accounted for 13% (95% confidence interval 2%-24%) of the total intervention effect size, while patient-provider communication accounted for 20% (5%-36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined, these two variables accounted for 28% (10%-46%) of the total effect size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Examining the roles of potential mediators in intervention trials may help identify constructs to target in order to enhance the effectiveness of interventions to increase screening </plain></SENT>
