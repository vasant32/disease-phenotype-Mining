<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated costs claimed to the health insurance by the hospital administering these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is a pilot project utilising the new I-COP database developed by the Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses of the Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: First, we estimated the costs based on current prices of procedures, medication, and materials from public sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the I-COP database, we then carried out a matched-pair comparison of 26 patients treated with FOLFOX4 or XELOX for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a period of three months of therapy (i.e. 6 cycles of FOLFOX4 or 4 cycles of XELOX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was done using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated cost for three months of therapy was 148,288 Czech crowns (CZK) for FOLFOX4 (including CZK 101,064 for chemotherapy drugs) and CZK 123,756 for XELOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall costs claimed to the insurance companies were CZK 160,158 and CZK 151,176 for FOLFOX4 and XELOX, respectively (p = 0.221) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The XELOX regimen had significantly higher costs for chemotherapy drugs (CZK 131,705 versus 114,531, p = 0.023) whereas other costs were lower than those for FOLFOX4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX4 and XELOX regimens can be considered as equivalent in terms of costs claimed by the hospital administering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
