<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of HDHPs on long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates and low socioeconomic status (SES) members is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates among 1306 Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) members for 1 year before and 2 years after an employer-mandated switch to HDHPs, compared with 1306 propensity score-matched controls who remained in HMOs by employer choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HDHP members had full coverage of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) but colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and double-contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema were subject to $500 to $2000 annual deductibles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HMO members had full coverage of these tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used generalized estimating equations to adjust screening rates for member characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We stratified analyses by SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates in the HDHP group relative to the control group trended down from baseline to the first and second follow-up years [ratios of change, 0.88, (95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.06) and 0.83, (0.69 to 1.00), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low SES HDHP members experienced a statistically significant relative decrease in colonoscopy in both follow-up years [0.65, (0.48 to 0.88) and 0.59, (0.42 to 0.84), respectively] and a trend toward increased FOBT [1.26, (0.92 to 1.72) and 1.30, (0.95 to 1.77), respectively] to maintain stable overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates [1.01, (0.77 to 1.32) and 0.93, (0.71 to 1.22), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High SES members experienced less pronounced decrease in colonoscopy [0.89, (0.67 to 1.18) and 0.87, (0.62 to 1.21), respectively] but FOBT rates did not increase [0.83, (0.62 to 1.11 and 0.81), (0.60 to 1.11), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Switching to a HDHP was associated with a downward trend in overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low SES HDHP members maintained stable rates, but substituted FOBT for colonoscopy and other tests now more widely recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research should investigate whether such reduced adherence to screening guidelines adversely affects health outcomes </plain></SENT>
