<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether consumption of 2.0 g ginger daily regulated the level of two key enzymes that control <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> production, COX-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flexible sigmoidoscopy was used to obtain colon biopsies at baseline and the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue levels of COX-1 and 15-PGDH were assessed using western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After ginger consumption, participants at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had a significantly reduced colonic COX-1 protein level (23.8±41%) compared with the placebo group (18.9±52%; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of 15-PGDH in the colon were unchanged </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ginger significantly lowered COX-1 protein expression in participants at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> but not in those at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
