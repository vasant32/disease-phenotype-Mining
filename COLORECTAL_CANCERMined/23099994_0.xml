<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although KRAS mutation has been identified as a negative predictive biomarker of anti-EGFR antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC), the efficacy in mCRC patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> status remains limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-EGFR antibodies work by blocking ligand binding, but the significance of EGFR ligands in mCRC has not been completely described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to identify the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven EGFR ligands and clinical outcomes in mCRC treated with anti-EGFR antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we determined an appropriate predictive strategy for anti-EGFR antibodies using these EGFR ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 36 mCRC patients who had been treated with cetuximab or panitumumab, we identified 26 mCRC patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS status treated properly as the second and further lines and analyzed the relationship between immunoreactivity to seven EGFR ligands and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Good clinical outcomes were associated with immunoreactivity against amphiregulin (AR), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), and epiregulin (EREG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, patients with immunoreactivity to greater than two of these four ligands (AR, HB-EGF, TGF-α, and EREG) had significantly higher response rate (53.3 vs. 0.0 %, p = 0.004) and disease control rate (93.3 vs. 9.0 %, p = 0.00002) and longer progression-free survival (median PFS: 231 vs. 79 days, p = 0.000008), when compared with patients with immunoreactivity against zero or one ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical analysis of four EGFR ligands (AR, HB-EGF, TGF-α, and EREG) might be a novel predictive biomarker and may help optimize patient selection for cetuximab and panitumumab therapy in patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
