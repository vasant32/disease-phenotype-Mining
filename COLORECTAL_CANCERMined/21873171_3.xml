<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously investigated the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines via a microarray analysis and found several genes that were significantly up-regulated by oncogenic KRAS under serum-starved conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these genes, we focused on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> reductase M2 (RRM2), which was reported to be associated with DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation and colony formation assays were performed using HCT116 cells transfected with lentiviral RRM2-shRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under serum-starved conditions, the expression level of RRM2 protein increased in HCT116 cells compared to HKe3 cells (HCT116 cells with a disruption in oncogenic KRAS), and the re-expression of KRAS in HKe3 cells induced the expression of RRM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the cell proliferation under serum-depleted conditions and the anchorage-independent growth were impaired by the reduction of RRM2 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RRM2 represents a novel therapeutic target, thus highlighting the potential utility of RRM2 inhibitors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with oncogenic KRAS </plain></SENT>
