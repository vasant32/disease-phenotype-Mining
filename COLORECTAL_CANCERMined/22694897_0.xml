<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated triplet chemotherapy-based intensive regimens proposed as first-line treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a FOLFOXIRI (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> [5-FU], irinotecan, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) combination regimen, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> now have the possibility of longer survival, but disappointingly, with increased toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Triplet chemotherapy regimen according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, irinotecan /<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, characterized by timed flat-infusion 5-FU administration, without leucovorin, obtained efficacy equivalent to other reported similar combination regimens (5-FU, irinotecan, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>), with increased received 5-FU dose intensity and lower grade 3 to 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To guarantee the proper balance between dose intensities, efficacy, and toxicity, triplet chemotherapy schedules could be further improved by abrogation of folinic acid and bolus 5-FU, a new and easy modality of 5-FU administration, such as timed flat-infusion 5-FU, associated with alternating irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>; this could favor diffusion of this intensive treatment in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
