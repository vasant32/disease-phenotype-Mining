<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between the genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also looked for differences in the staining of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and adjacent colonic mucosa to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor β1 and its possible prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five specimens from patients who underwent resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in our institute were sectioned and stained for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor β1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histopathological slides were evaluated for positive staining in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were statistically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor β1 stain was found in the nuclei of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We noted positive stain also in the cytoplasm of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences were found regarding the positivity of the staining between the deceased and surviving patients, men/women and those who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> vs. the non-metastatic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that there is an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> influence on the development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
