<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has recently been reported that the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> (BMs) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> (PC) has increased in comparison with historical series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of BMs in the pre- and post-docetaxel era in a single institution in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> oncological patients are referred to one Radiotherapy and one Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched the electronic databases of these departments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> males with BMs entered from 1994 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The year of the introduction of docetaxel into clinical practice (2002) divided the observation period into two 9-year periods: period 1 (P1) from 1994 until 2002 (P1), and period 2 (P2) after 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with BMs was constant: 241 patients in P1 and 249 in P2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The greatest changes in frequency between P1 and P2 involved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (+75.9 %), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740457" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">renal cancer</z:e> (+141.9 %), and PC (+238.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total number of patients with BMs from PC was nine: two in P1 (0.8 %) and seven in P2 (2.8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but two of these patients developed BMs after becoming castration-resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median BM-free survival was 36 months, whereas median BM survival was 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the appearance of BMs in the natural history of PC is usually related to the late phase of the disease, and mortality due to PC remained constant, it seems that there really has been an increase in the frequency of BMs from PC that may reflect a gain in survival </plain></SENT>
