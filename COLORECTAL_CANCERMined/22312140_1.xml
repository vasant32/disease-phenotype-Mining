<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: National guidelines recommend that physicians discuss end-of-life (EOL) care planning with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> whose life expectancy is less than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of EOL care discussions for patients with stage IV lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and where, when, and with whom these discussions take place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from 2003 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Participants lived in Northern California, Los Angeles County, North Carolina, Iowa, or Alabama or received care in 1 of 5 large HMOs or 1 of 15 Veterans Health Administration sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 2155 patients with stage IV lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: End-of-life care discussions reported in patient and surrogate interviews or documented in medical records through 15 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 73% of patients had EOL care discussions identified by at least 1 source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 1470 patients who died during follow-up, 87% had EOL care discussions, compared with 41% of the 685 patients who were alive at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 1081 first EOL care discussions documented in records, 55% occurred in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oncologists documented EOL care discussions with only 27% of their patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 959 patients with documented EOL care discussions who died during follow-up, discussions took place a median of 33 days before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The depth and quality of EOL care discussions was not evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Much of the information about discussions came from surrogates of patients who died before baseline interviews could be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although most patients with stage IV lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> discuss EOL care planning with physicians before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, many discussions occur during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hospital care, with providers other than oncologists, and late in the course of illness </plain></SENT>
