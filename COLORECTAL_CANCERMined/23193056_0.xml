<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies have shown how the incidence of various diseases, including certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, is relatively low in the Mediterranean basin compared to that of other European or North America countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current knowledge indicates that the phenolic fraction of olive oil has antitumor effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to the ability to be chemopreventive, with its high <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity, the antitumor effects of olive oil <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenols</z:chebi> (OO-<z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenols</z:chebi>) has been studied because of their capacity to inhibit proliferation and promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines, by diverse mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review will summarize and discuss the most recent relevant results on the antitumor effect of OO-<z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenols</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (BC) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, very recent data will be reported and discussed showing the molecular signaling pathways activated by OO-<z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenols</z:chebi> in different histopathological BC cell types, suggesting the potential use of OO-<z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenols</z:chebi> as adjuvant treatment against several subsets of BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data summarized here represent a good starting point for more extensive studies for better insight into the molecular mechanisms induced by OO-<z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenols</z:chebi> and to increase the availability of chemopreventive or therapeutic drugs to fight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
