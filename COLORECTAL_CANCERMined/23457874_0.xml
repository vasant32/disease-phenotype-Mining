<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A recent study showed a higher frequency of GA deletion at rs67491583 in African American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients compared to controls, suggesting a likely contribution of this allele to racial disparity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a pilot study in an indigenous African population to evaluate this potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected epidemiological data and biological specimen from consenting consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and controls presenting at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Clinic of University College Hospital, Ibadan from 2001 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined germline DNA for delGA by PCR-amplification of two overlapping fragments using standard primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The products were directly sequenced using Applied Biosystems BigDye v3.1 sequencing chemistry and AB 13730 automatic DNA sequencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 45 cases and 45 controls of which genotyping was successful in 39 cases and 38 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 5 heterozygous and 2 homozygous GA deletions with frequency of 11.54% (9/78) among cases whereas there were 8 heterozygous and 1 homozygous GA deletions among controls with frequency of 13.15% (10/76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(p= 0.79, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.34-2.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there is no association between the delGA (rs67491583) variant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in this indigenous African population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However our sample size was small and the participants were not ethnically homogenous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to evaluate this marker in African <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
