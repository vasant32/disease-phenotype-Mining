<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: It is widely acknowledged that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> plays a key role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The level of circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6), one of the major proinflammatory adipokines, is correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, which are known to be risk factors for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between the circulating level of IL-6 and the presence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a total colonoscopy-based cross-sectional study conducted between January and December 2008, serum levels of IL-6 were measured in samples of venous blood obtained from 336 male participants attending health checkups (118 individuals with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 218 age-matched controls) after an overnight fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> group, the median levels of serum IL-6 (1.24 vs. 1.04 pg/mL; P = 0.01), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) were to be significantly higher than those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When restricted to individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, levels of IL-6 were positively correlated with body mass index, insulin, and HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic analyses adjusted to include insulin or HOMA-IR showed that high levels of IL-6 were associated with the presence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant interaction of IL-6 with HOMA-IR to modify this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that increased serum levels of IL-6 are positively associated with the presence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in men, independently of insulin and HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
