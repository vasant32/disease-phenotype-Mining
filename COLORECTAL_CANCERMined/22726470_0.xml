<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of endoscopist training on accuracy of surveillance intervals based on in vivo optical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 1231 patients with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (before training, n = 577; after training, n = 654) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopists were randomized to either participate or not participate in two 1-hour training sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists' in vivo pathology predictions were recorded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of in vivo prediction-guided surveillance intervals were compared with pathology-guided intervals as the criterion standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surveillance interval accuracy before and after training were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Surveillance interval accuracy based on in vivo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> predictions with pathology-guided intervals as criterion standard before and after a training intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Optically predicted surveillance intervals for the trained group of endoscopists had an overall accuracy of 84% (242/287) before training and 82% (261/317) after training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was little evidence to suggest that training had a meaningful impact on the accuracy of optically predicted surveillance intervals (odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI, 0.76-1.89, P = .44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Limitations include small sample size, lack of endoscopist prediction confidence levels, and optional use of narrow-band imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance interval accuracy did not meet published thresholds (&gt;90%) to use in vivo optical diagnosis without pathologic confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Larger studies, focused specifically on the impact of training, are needed to validate methods to improve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> diagnosis and surveillance predication accuracy </plain></SENT>
