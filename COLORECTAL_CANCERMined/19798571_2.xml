<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Human TIP30 was initially identified as a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> suppressor gene whose expression was down-regulated in human liver, lung, breast, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo>, and recently the role of this gene was examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the level of TIP30 expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TIP30 protein levels were lower in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue from the control group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of hypermethylation of TIP30 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were 36%, while there was no aberrant methylation in paired adjacent non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant inverse association was found between TIP30 methylation status and expression of the TIP30 protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Somatic missense mutations in the TIP30 gene were identified in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that promoter methylation is involved in the decreased expression of TIP30 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
