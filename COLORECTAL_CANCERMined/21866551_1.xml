<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cx43 was further found to negatively regulate growth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, in part by enhancing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, Cx43 was found to colocalize with β-catenin and reduce Wnt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study represents the first evidence that Cx43 acts as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor and that loss of Cx43 expression during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development is associated with reduced patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study has important implications for the assessment of Cx43 as a prognostic marker and target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prevention and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gap junctions consist of intercellular channels that permit direct transfer of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gap junction channel protein Cx43 plays important roles in cell growth control and differentiation and is frequently dysregulated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the functional importance and clinical relevance of Cx43 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development has remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that Cx43 is downregulated or aberrantly localized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, which is associated with loss of gap junction intercellular communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The in situ protein expression of Cx43 was analyzed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> in a cohort of 674 patients and related to established clinicopathological variables and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of the patients had weak or no expression of Cx43 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Loss of Cx43 expression was significantly correlated with shorter relapse-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Loss of Cx43 further identified a high-risk subgroup among stage I and stage II patients with reduced relapse-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of Cx43 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line HT29 was associated with reduced growth in monolayer and soft agar cultures and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cx43 was found to colocalize with β-catenin and negatively regulate the Wnt signaling pathway, and expression of Cx43 was associated with increased levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these data indicate that Cx43 is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor protein that predicts clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
