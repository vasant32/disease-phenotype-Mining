<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is limited high-quality evidence about the impact of patient navigation (PN) on outcomes for patients with diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We pooled data from two sites from the national Patient Navigation Research Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 438) with newly diagnosed breast (n = 353) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (n = 85) were randomized to PN or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trained lay navigators met with patients randomized to PN to help them assess treatment barriers and identify resources to overcome barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used intent-to-treat analysis to assess time to completion of primary treatment, psychologic distress (impact of events scale), and satisfaction (patient satisfaction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related care) within 3 months after initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sample was predominantly middle-aged (mean age = 57) and female (90%); 44% were race-ethnic minorities (44%), 46% reported lower education levels, 18% were uninsured, and 9% reported a non-English primary language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The randomized groups were comparable in baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary analysis showed no statistically significant group differences in time to completion of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, satisfaction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related care, or psychologic distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis showed that socially disadvantaged patients (i.e., uninsured, low English proficiency, and non-English primary language) who received PN reported higher satisfaction than those receiving usual care (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Navigated patients living alone reported greater distress than those receiving usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary analysis showed no overall benefit, the subgroup analysis suggests that PN may improve satisfaction with care for certain disadvantaged individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: PN for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients may not necessarily reduce treatment time nor distress </plain></SENT>
