<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many properties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells are reminiscent of those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genes important to stem cell development have been significantly implicated in the etiology and clinical outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the associations of genetic variations in these genes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis have not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the effects of eight potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six stem cell-related genes on the prognosis of a well-characterized population of 380 Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients diagnosed from February 2006 to January 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most significant finding was related to rs879882, a variant in the 5' region of POU5F1 gene which encodes a protein essential for embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency, and induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variant-containing genotypes of rs879882 were associated with an increased risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-3.76, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In chemotherapy-stratified analysis, the association remained borderline significant in patients receiving chemotherapy (HR = 1.97, 95% CI 0.89-4.34, P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a nonsynonymous SNP of APC gene was also significantly associated with recurrence risk in chemotherapy-treated patients (HR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.14-6.06 P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further analyses showed a combined effect of the two SNPs in predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence in patients receiving chemotherapy (P = 0.04) but not in those without chemotherapy (P = 0.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an exploratory multivariate assessment model indicated that these two variants enhanced the power to predict recurrence after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We presented one of the first epidemiologic studies showing that stem cell-related genetic variants may impact <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> clinical outcomes, especially in chemotherapy-treated patients </plain></SENT>
