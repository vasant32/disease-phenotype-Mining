<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether inhibition of P-gp function might decrease intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> as an inhibitor of P-gp function in Apc(Min/+) mice, which lack a functional Apc gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005266'>intestinal polyps</z:hpo> and 1-year survival rates after the ingestion of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> contained in dry pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in Mdr1a(+/+)Apc(Min/+) mice fed with pellets containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> was significantly lower than that in mice fed with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>-free pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1-year survival rate of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>-fed mice was also improved in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were similar to data from P-gp knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that it might be possible to use <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> development during the early stage of colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we propose a novel chemopreventive agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> that acts by inhibiting P-gp function </plain></SENT>
