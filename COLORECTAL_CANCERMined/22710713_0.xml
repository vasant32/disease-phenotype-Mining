<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Past studies have shown that amplified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/IGF1 receptor (IGF1-R) signalling has an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) development, progression and resistance to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we demonstrate that downregulation of microRNA-497 (miR-497) as a result of DNA copy number reduction is involved in upregulation of IGF1-R in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MiR-497 and miR-195 of the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family that share the same 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) binding seed sequence and are predicted to target IGF1-R were concurrently downregulated in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues relative to paired adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, only overexpression of miR-497 led to suppression of the IGF1-R 3'UTR activity and downregulation of the endogenous IGF1-R protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with inhibition of cell survival, proliferation and invasion, and increased sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by various stimuli including the chemotherapeutic drugs <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> ligand <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biological effect of miR-497 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells was largely mediated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signalling, as overexpression of an active form of Akt reversed its impact on cell survival and proliferation, recapitulating the effect of overexpression of IGF1-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of miR-497 and miR-195 appeared to associate with copy number loss of a segment of chromosome 17p13.1, where these miRs are located at proximity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly to miR-195, the members of the same miR family, miR-424 that was upregulated, and miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 that were unaltered in expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues compared with paired adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, did not appear to have a role in regulating the expression of IGF1-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results identify downregulation of miR-497 as an important mechanism of upregulation of IGF1-R in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells that contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
