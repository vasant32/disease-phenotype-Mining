<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying the aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway that accompanies APC mutation, we carried out a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based semiquantitative metabolome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments comparing SW480 cells expressing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> APC and truncated APC indicated that the levels of metabolites involved in the latter stages of the intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle, including <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15741">succinic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18012">fumaric acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6650">malic acid</z:chebi>, were significantly higher in the SW480 cells expressing the truncated APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an in vivo study, we found that the levels of most amino acids were higher in the non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> tissues of APC(min/+) mice than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues of the control mice and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> tissues of APC(min/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ribitol, the levels of which were decreased in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> lesions of the APC(min/+) mice and the SW480 cells expressing the truncated APC, reduced the growth of SW480 cells with the APC mutation, but did not affect the growth of SW480 transfectants expressing full-length APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15611">sarcosine</z:chebi> was found to be significantly higher in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> tissues of APC(min/+) mice than in their non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> tissues and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues of the control mice, and the treatment of SW480 cells with 50 Î¼M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15611">sarcosine</z:chebi> resulted in a significant increase in their growth rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that APC mutation causes changes in energetic metabolite pathways and that these alterations might be involved in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
