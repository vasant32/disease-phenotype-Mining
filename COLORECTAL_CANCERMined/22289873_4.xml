<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies examining the magnitude of this association have yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a meta-analysis of population-based cohort studies to determine the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL to perform a systematic literature search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We included 8 studies in the meta-analysis on the basis of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We calculated pooled standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with UC and performed meta-regression analyses of the effect of cohort size, calendar period, observation time, percentage with <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, and rates of colectomy on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An average of 1.6% of patients with UC was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during 14 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SIRs ranged from 1.05 to 3.1, with a pooled SIR of 2.4 (95% CI, 2.1-2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men with UC had a greater risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (SIR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.2-3.0) than women (SIR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Young age was a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (SIR, 8.6; 95% CI, 3.8-19.5; although this might have resulted from small numbers), as was extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (SIR, 4.8; 95% CI, 3.9-5.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In meta-regression analyses, only cohort size was associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In population-based cohorts, UC increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> 2.4-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Male sex, young age at diagnosis with UC, and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> increase the risk </plain></SENT>
