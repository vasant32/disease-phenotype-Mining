<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess self-reported compliance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening guidelines among primary care physicians (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>) and to assess physician and practice characteristics associated with reported compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Survey data from 984 PCPs in Arizona were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening practices, recommendations, and compliance with guidelines were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physician and practice characteristics associated with guideline compliance were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While 77.5% of physicians reported using national screening guidelines, only 51.7% reported recommendations consistent with the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Younger physicians were significantly more likely to report compliance with screening guidelines (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.07-2.10) as were female clinicians (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.11-1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physicians practicing in solo (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.19-0.58), group (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.21-0.62), or community health centers (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.17-0.81) were significantly less likely to report following guidelines as compared to those in academic practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Guideline compliance was higher for fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (65.0%) than colonoscopy (56.7%); overuse of screening for these modalities was reported among 34.4% of physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> are not adequately following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to clarify the reasons for this lack of compliance, especially as guidelines become more complex </plain></SENT>
