<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated their role for differential diagnosis, therapy monitoring and prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretherapeutic levels of cytokeratin-19 fragments (CYFRA 21-1), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> antigen (CA) 19-9 were measured in 42 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 45 with benign colorectal diseases and 51 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, courses of CYFRA 21-1, tissue <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> antigen (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>), tissue <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> specific antigen (TPS), M30-antigen, CEA and CA 19-9 were analyzed in prospectively collected sera of 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during primary chemotherapy and were correlated with therapy response and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Similar to CEA and CA 19-9, CYFRA 21-1 was significantly elevated in serum from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (median 2.1 ng/ml) as compared with healthy (1.2 ng/ml; p&lt;0.0001) and benign gastrointestinal controls (1.7 ng/ml; p=0.0178) and showed stage dependency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (p=0.0118) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CYFRA 21-1 correlated with CEA in benign diseases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> but not with CA 19-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best discrimination between healthy controls and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was achieved by combination of CYFRA 21-1 and CA 19-9 (area under the curve; AUC=86.7%), while the combination of CEA and CA 19-9 discriminated best between benign diseases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (AUC=73.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients during primary chemotherapy, levels of cytokeratins CYFRA 21-1, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, TPS, CEA and CA 19-9 tended to be higher in patients with poor response to therapy and with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cytokeratins are elevated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and show some association with response to primary therapy and prognosis </plain></SENT>
