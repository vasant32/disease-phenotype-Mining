<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-level microsatellite instability, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at four loci, CpG island methylation phenotype based on seven loci, BRAF V600E mutation and KRAS mutation in signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were compared with mucinous and conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship of these molecular features in signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with clinicopathologic features and survival was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LOH was observed in 93% of signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> compared with 62 and 70% of mucinous and conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, 80% of signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> with high-level microsatellite instability showed LOH compared with 14% each of mucinous and conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-level microsatellite instability, CpG island methylation phenotype-positive status and BRAF V600E mutation were more often seen in signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared with conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BRAF V600E mutation was significantly associated with CpG island methylation phenotype-positive status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stage and BRAF V600E mutation in microsatellite-stable cases were the only variables with an affect on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> manifested by LOH is nearly a universal finding in signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, including cases with high-level microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> of signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> irrespective of high-level microsatellite-instability status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BRAF V600E mutation and CpG island methylation phenotype-positive status are similar in signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> but more frequent when compared with conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, BRAF V600E mutation adversely affects survival in microsatellite-stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but not in high-level microsatellite-unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of methylation and BRAF V600E mutation suggests that many signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> may be related to the serrated pathway of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
