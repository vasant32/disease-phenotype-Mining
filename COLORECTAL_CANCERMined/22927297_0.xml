<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glycogenes are a group of genes which epigenetic status was found to be changed in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined promoter methylation status of the glycogene beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (B4GALT1) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation status of B4GALT1 was assessed in 130 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and in paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue using quantitative methylation specific PCR (QMSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B4GALT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was evaluated in methylated/unmethylated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also investigated microsatellite stability and microsatellite instability status and KRAS/BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discriminatory power of QMSP was assessed by receiving operating curve (ROC) analysis on a training set of 24 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and paired mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.737 (95% confidence interval [CI]:0.591-0.881, P = 0.005) with an optimal cutoff value of 2.07 yielding a 54% sensitivity (95% CI: 35.1%-72.1%) and a specificity of 91.7% (95% CI: 74.1%-97.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed in an independent validation set where B4GALT1 methylation was detected in 52/106 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was observed between methylation and B4GALT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels (r = -0.482, P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in methylation levels and frequencies was demonstrated in invasive lesions as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (P = 0.0001) and in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> samples as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>B4GALT1 methylation is a frequent and specific event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and correlates with downregulation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the glycogene B4GALT1 represent a valuable candidate biomarker of invasive phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
