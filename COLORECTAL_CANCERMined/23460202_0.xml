<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The MUTYH DNA-glycosylase is indirectly engaged in the repair of the miscoding 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanine (8-oxodG) lesion by removing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> erroneously incorporated opposite the oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inherited biallelic mutations in the MUTYH gene are responsible for a recessive syndrome, the MUTYH-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> (MAP), which confers an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we functionally characterized the Q338H variant using recombinant proteins, as well as cell-based assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a common variant among human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> genes, which is generally considered, unrelated to the MAP phenotype but recently indicated as a low-penetrance allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the Q338H variant retains a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> DNA-glycosylase activity in vitro, but it shows a reduced ability to interact with the replication sensor RAD9:RAD1:HUS1 (9-1-1) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison with Mutyh(-)(/)(-) mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> MUTYH cDNA, the expression of Q338H variant was associated with increased levels of DNA 8-oxodG, hypersensitivity to oxidant and accumulation of the population in the S phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, an inefficient interaction of MUTYH with the 9-1-1 complex leads to a repair-defective phenotype, indicating that a proper communication between MUTYH enzymatic function and the S phase checkpoint is needed for effective repair of oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
