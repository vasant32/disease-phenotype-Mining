<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, its expression was examined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray containing colorectal non-neoplastic mucosa (NNM), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissue and cell lines were studied for REIC expression or its secretory level by Western blot, RT-PCR or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that REIC was differentially expressed in Colo201, Colo205, DLD-1, HCT-15, HCT-116, HT-29, KM-12, SW480, SW620, and WiDr with its secretion concentration less than 300 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinomas</z:mp> showed statistically lower REIC expression than matched NNM with no difference for protein content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, REIC expression was significantly decreased from NNM, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study indicated that down-regulated REIC expression might play an important role in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence and subsequent progression </plain></SENT>
