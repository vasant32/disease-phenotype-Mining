<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that circadian genes play a role in the development and progression of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to assess the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in circadian genes on recurrence and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine functional SNPs in 3 genes (CLOCK, NPAS2, and BMAL1) on the circadian positive feedback loop were selected and genotyped using the Sequenom iPLEX genotyping system in a cohort of 411 resected Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve were used for the prognosis analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors identified 2 SNPs in the CLOCK gene to be significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNP rs3749474 exhibited a significant association with survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients in the additive model (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.81; P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients carrying the heterozygous variant of rs1801260 had significantly increased overall survival compared with those carrying homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.88; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings from functional assay provided further biological support for these significant associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis found no modifying effect of chemotherapy on the prognostic significance of both SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed cumulative effects of these 2 SNPs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> overall survival (P for trend = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients carrying no unfavorable genotypes, those carrying 2 unfavorable genotypes had a 2.92-fold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest for the first time that CLOCK gene polymorphisms may serve as an independent prognostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
