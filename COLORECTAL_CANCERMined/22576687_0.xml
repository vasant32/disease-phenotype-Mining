<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, attention was focused on MMP-15 and MMP-19, two less known members of the MMP family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression profile of MMP-15 and -19 was assayed in samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa, microadenomas and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> using confocal analysis, western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both qRT-PCR and western blotting showed that MMP-15 and MMP-19 appeared to be upregulated during colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, with different expression patterns: MMP-15 expression level increases from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa to microadenomas, with a reduced level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with respect to microadenomas; the semiquantitative immunofluorescence analysis showed a stromal localization of this protein in the early phases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increasing amount of MMP-19 mRNA and protein levels were observed in the progression of colonic lesions; MMP-19 staining increased in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa-microadenoma-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such different expression patterns, are probably due to the different roles played in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> by these two molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conflicting data on the role of these proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> have been reported, thus, an improved understanding of the biological roles of MMPs, in particular the lesser known members such as MMP-15 and 19, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may lead to a re-evaluation of the use of MMP inhibitors and suggests the need of integrated translational studies on MMP expression patterns </plain></SENT>
