<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MGMT is the primary vehicle for cellular removal of alkyl lesions from the O-6 position of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> and the O-4 position of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While key to the maintenance of genomic integrity, MGMT also removes damage induced by alkylating chemotherapies, inhibiting the efficacy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Germline variants of human MGMT are well-characterized, but somatic variants found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were, prior to this work, uncharacterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that MGMT G132R, from a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumor</z:e>, and MGMT G156C, from a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line, are unable to rescue methyltransferase-deficient Escherichia coli as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) human MGMT after treatment with a methylating agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using pre-steady state kinetics, we biochemically characterized these variants as having a reduced rate constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>G132R binds DNA containing an O(6) -methylguanine lesion half as tightly as WT MGMT, while G156C has a 40-fold decrease in binding affinity for the same damaged DNA versus WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mammalian cells expressing either G132R or G156C are more sensitive to methylating agents than mammalian cells expressing WT MGMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>G132R is slightly resistant to O(6) -benzylguanine, an inhibitor of MGMT in clinical trials, while G156C is almost completely resistant to this inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The impared functionality of expressed variants G132R and G156C suggests that the presence of somatic variants of MGMT in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> could impact chemotherapeutic outcomes.
