<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>), a receptor for the guidance cue netrin-1, plays a pivotal role in organizing neuronal circuitry by guiding growing axons and dendrites to their correct targets and by influencing synaptic connectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results from experiments we previously conducted in dcc-heterozygous mice show that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> plays a critical role in the developmental organization of the mesocorticolimbic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) circuitry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore we have shown that reduced expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> during development and/or throughout life confers resilience to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and behavioural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this "protective" phenotype only emerges after puberty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we assess whether <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> may contribute to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> gene for association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> using a case-control sample consisting of 556 unrelated schizophrenic patients and 208 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found one SNP, rs2270954, to be nominally associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>; patients were less likely to be heterozygous at this locus and more likely to be homozygous for the minor allele (Ï‡(2)=9.84, df=2, nominal p=0.0071) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, this SNP is located within the 3' untranslated region, an area known to contain a number of regulatory sequences that determine the stability and translation efficacy of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results, together with our previous findings from studies in rodents, point at <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> as a promising novel candidate gene that may contribute to the genetic basis behind individual differences in susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
