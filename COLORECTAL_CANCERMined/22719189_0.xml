<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nested case-control study was designed to include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> first primary incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases diagnosed between inclusion in the SUpplémentation en VItamines et Minéraux AntioXydants cohort in 1994 and the end of follow-up in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases (n = 50) were matched with two randomly selected controls (n = 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between pre-diagnostic levels of hs-CRP, adiponectin, leptin, soluble vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, E-selectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) and relative integrated discrimination improvement (RIDI) statistics were used to assess the discriminatory potential of the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma adiponectin level was associated with decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (P for linear trend = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quartiles of sVCAM-1 were associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (P for linear trend = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was observed with any of the other biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to standard models with known risk factors, those including both adiponectin and sVCAM-1 had substantially improved performance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk prediction (P for AUC improvement = 0.01, RIDI = 26.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pre-diagnostic plasma adiponectin and sVCAM-1 levels are associated with decreased and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These relationships must be confirmed in large validation studies </plain></SENT>
