<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine outcomes following curative colorectal resection in patients aged 80 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study design is retrospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted from the university hospital database and medical records of patients aged 80 years and older operated between April 2004 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention was curative colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures include postoperative morbidity, mortality and individual risk factors associated with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-eight patients (43.8 % males, age = 84 ± 3 years) were included; 72.6 % received elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher complication rate and 30 day, 1 year and 4 year mortality were present for emergency operations compared to elective (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-year survival was 65.0 % for elective resections and 55.1 % for emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 4 years of follow-up, survival was 49.2 % for the elective vs. 27.6 % for emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The American Society of Anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) score is the only factor associated with the 30-day mortality at the multivariate analysis (p &lt; 0.01), Dukes staging with overall mortality (p &lt; 0.005), sex and mode of the operation with major complications (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A limitation of the study is that is retrospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The highest mortality rates following colorectal surgery in the elderly are in the early postoperative period, especially for emergency operations and patients with significant comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the 1-year survival following elective curative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> approaches 65 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score and modality of the operation (elective vs. emergency) impacted on postoperative mortality and morbidity and could be used to select patients with more favourable outcomes </plain></SENT>
