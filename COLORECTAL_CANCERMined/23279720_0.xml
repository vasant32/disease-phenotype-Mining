<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Direct medical costs were estimated for five treatment settings from a public and private hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The costs included in evaluation were for drug acquisition, preparation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, bolus and infusional 5-FU), administration and wastage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cost of drug acquisition was calculated based on dosage data and the mean number of treatment cycles from the pivotal studies NO16966 and NO16967 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no costs associated with preparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and leucovorin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> grouping and costing study was performed to determine the relevant administration costs associated with central venous access devices, their placement, maintenance and removal (for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> administration) and the continuous infusion of 5-FU via a continuous ambulatory delivery device pump or infuser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This economic evaluation has shown that treating mCRC patients with XELOX in the first and second-line settings results in average cost savings of $9110 and $7113, respectively, compared with mFOLFOX-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multi-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the use of XELOX remained cost-saving from an Australian government health budget perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of XELOX, compared with mFOLFOX-6, for the treatment of mCRC is cost-saving in the Australian government health budget </plain></SENT>
