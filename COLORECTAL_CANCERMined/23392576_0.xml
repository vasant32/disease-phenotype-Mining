<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on 411 CRC patients after surgery were tested for the MTHFR 677C &gt; T and 1298A &gt; C polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For MTHFR C677T, patients with CT genotype (HR = 1.17; 95 % CI 0.77-1.80) and those with TT genotype (HR = 1.09; 95 % CI 0.67-1.75) had no statistically significant greater risk of dying than those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For MTHFR A1298C, the HRs of AC and CC genotype were 1.09 (95 % CI 0.75-1.59) and 0.79 (95 % CI 0.48-1.29) comparing with AA genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup, 183 patients received chemotherapy treatment, and the HRs of patients with CT and TT genotype were 0.93 (95 % CI 0.50-1.72) and 0.86 (95 % CI 0.44-1.68) for MTHFR C677T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For A1298C polymorphism, AC genotype (HR = 1.39; 95 % CI 0.81-2.39) and CC genotype (HR = 1.22; 95 % CI 0.75-2.00) did not show significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusions, no significant association was observed between the 677C &gt; T and 1298A &gt; C polymorphisms of MTHFR and the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with curative resection, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subjects and the subgroup of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
