<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive liver resection (MILR) for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) is gaining widespread acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data are still lacking on the feasibility, long- and short-term outcomes of laparoscopic major hepatectomy (i.e., three or more liver segments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 2002 and December 2008, prospectively collected data of 117 patients who underwent major liver resection [97 open (OMLR) and 20 laparoscopic (LMLR) procedures] for CRLM were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients in the LMLR group were matched with 20 patients of the OMLR based on 13 parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the long- and short-term outcomes between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median duration of surgery was 257.5 (range 75-360) min in LMLR versus 232.5 (range 120-400) min in OMLR (P = 0.228) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median blood loss during surgery was 550 ml in each group (range 100-4,000 vs. 100-2,500 ml, P = 0.884) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of postoperative complications (both severity and location) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median magnitude of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free resection margin was 7.5 versus 5.5 mm in the laparoscopy versus open group, respectively (P = 0.651) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median disease-free survival (DFS) of the entire study population was 18.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.9-50.0 months] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) was 50.7 months (95% CI 36.2 months to undetermined) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The estimated DFS and OS rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were comparable in the two groups (P = 0.637 and 0.872, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic MLR for selected CRLM is feasible and might result in comparable oncologic outcomes as in open liver resection </plain></SENT>
