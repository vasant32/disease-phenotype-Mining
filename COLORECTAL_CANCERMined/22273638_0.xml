<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Increasing scientific evidence supports the use of fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography/ computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the staging of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A detailed and accurate characterization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biology and imaging characteristics is therefore of paramount importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine whether CT attenuation, in Hounsfield units, was correlated with FDG uptake in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and imaging data of patients from our institution with histologically proven colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> who were referred for PET/CT staging were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of our study, we included only those patients who had undergone dual-time-point imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 patients with 62 hepatic secondaries were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The perlesional CT attenuation (in Hounsfield units), FDG uptake (in standardized uptake values SUV 60 and SUV 120), and size (in cm) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant positive relationship was observed between perlesional CT attenuation and SUV 60 (r=0.433, P=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar significant positive relationship was shown between perlesional CT attenuation and SUV 120 (r=0.414, P=0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that, in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, FDG uptake was positively correlated with CT attenuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If a lesion appeared to be indeterminate because of apparently low FDG avidity, internal content must be taken into consideration to minimize misdiagnosis and false negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We proposed that such a relationship may be due to the mucinous contents of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> or degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further research, particularly on quantification of the extent of mucin production and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, may allow a more precise relationship to be drawn between CT attenuation and FDG uptake </plain></SENT>
