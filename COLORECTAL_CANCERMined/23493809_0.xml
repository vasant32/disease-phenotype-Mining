<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To verify the clinical results of the endoscopic stenting procedure for colorectal obstructions followed by laparoscopic colorectal resection with "one stage anastomosis" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2003 to March 2009 in our surgical department, 48 patients underwent endoscopic stenting for colorectal occlusive lesion: 30 males (62.5%) and 18 females (37.5%) with an age range from 40 years to 92 years (median age 69.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients enrolled in our study were diagnosed with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> originating from the colorectal tract without bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Obstruction was primitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 45 cases (93.7%) and benign anastomotic stricture in 3 cases (6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgical resection was totally laparoscopic in 69% of cases (24 patients) while 17% (6 patients) of cases were video-assisted due to the local extension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with infiltrations of surrounding structures (urinary bladder in 2 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> and iliac vessels in the others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 14% of cases (5 patients), resection was performed by open surgery due to the high American Society of Anesthesiologists score and the elderly age of patients (median age of 89 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed a terminal stomy in only 7 patients out of 35, 6 colostomies and one ileostomy (in a total colectomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other 28 cases (80%), we performed bowel anastomosis at the same time as resection, employing a temporary ileostomy only in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colorectal stenting transforms an emergency operation in to an elective operation performable in a totally laparoscopic manner, limiting the confection of colostomy with its correlated complications </plain></SENT>
