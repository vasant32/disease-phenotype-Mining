<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the relatively high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, there is no nationwide comprehensive program for screening in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate national <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> data and help to determine guidelines for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incidence data used in this study were obtained from Iranian annual of National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registration report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age standardized rates (ASR)were calculated using world standard population and were categorized by age, sex, anatomic subsite and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using SPSS.V.13 and Open Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health software (OpenEpi v.2.3.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A quarter of cases were less than 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were detected in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall ASR in the four years period was 38.0 per 100000 and was higher for men compared women (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results of present study indicated that incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is relatively high in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in people under 50 years and in rectum were reported higher than other countries that related etiologic factors should be investigate in further studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to the increasing of ASR after age 50 years, it seems that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of screening at age 50 would be appropriate </plain></SENT>
