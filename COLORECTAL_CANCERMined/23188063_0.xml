<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are also important predictive markers for resistance to the monoclonal antibodies that target the epidermal growth factor receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, KRAS and BRAF mutations were analyzed using a direct sequence method in 254 Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and the associations between KRAS or BRAF mutations and clinicopathological characteristics or outcome were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS and BRAF mutations were detected in 33.5 and 6.7 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous reports, BRAF mutations were significantly correlated with the anatomical site of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (P = 0.001) and high frequency of microsatellite instability (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutations were correlated with poor overall survival in the full patient cohort (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were significantly correlated with poor recurrence-free survival (P = 0.03), particularly in patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed that KRAS mutations were a negative predictor of recurrence-free survival in patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: KRAS mutation status could be a novel biomarker for predicting disease recurrence in Japanese patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
