<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We introduce Pathifier, an algorithm that infers pathway deregulation scores for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sample on the basis of expression data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This score is determined, in a context-specific manner, for every particular dataset and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> that is being investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The algorithm transforms gene-level information into pathway-level information, generating a compact and biologically relevant representation of each sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the algorithm's performance on three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> datasets and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> multiforme datasets and show that our multipathway-based representation is reproducible, preserves much of the original information, and allows inference of complex biologically significant information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discovered several pathways that were significantly associated with survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> patients and two whose scores are predictive of survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>: CXCR3-mediated signaling and oxidative phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also identified a subclass of proneural and neural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> with significantly better survival, and an EGF receptor-deregulated subclass of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
