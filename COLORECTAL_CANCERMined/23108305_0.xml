<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine largely induced during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the liver, IL-6 induces the synthesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins, which are believed to support the response of the body during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-6 has been reported to be a growth factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-6 on cells binds to an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) forming an IL-6/IL-6R complex, which associates with a homodimer of a second receptor subunit, gp130, to initiate signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gp130 is present on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells of the body, whereas IL-6R is only expressed on hepatocytes, some leukocytes, and some epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since gp130 has no measurable affinity for IL-6, cells which do not express IL-6R are unresponsive to the cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A soluble form of IL-6R, which is found in the blood, can still bind IL-6 and the complex of IL-6/sIL-6R can bind to cellular gp130 also on cells without IL-6R expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This signaling mechanism has been called trans-signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a soluble form of gp130 (sgp130) blocks IL-6 trans-signaling without affecting classic IL-6 signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We used a dimerized version of sgp130 fused to the Fc portion of an IgG1 antibody (sgp130Fc) to discriminate between classic and trans-signaling of IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It turned out that proinflammatory activities of IL-6 are mediated via trans-signaling, whereas anti-inflammatory or regenerative activities are mediated via classic signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results are important for strategies to inhibit IL-6 signaling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
