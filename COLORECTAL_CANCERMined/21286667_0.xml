<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 206 consecutively-collected patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were screened for germline mutations in the principal DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1 and MSH2, and in the Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) genes involved in homologous recombination DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis was performed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and automated sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues were evaluated for gene expression by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genes of the FA pathway were found to participate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> pathogenesis, being silenced during disease progression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, MLH1 and MSH2 genes seem to be inactivated at earlier stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, very few (about 5%) cases presented a simultaneous inactivation of the MMR and FA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, our findings indicated that: i) mismatch DNA repair remains the main mechanism to be altered at both germline and somatic levels among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients; ii) functional impairments of mismatch DNA repair and FA-related repair may represent two different pathogenetic alterations which are concurring in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
