<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening tests for adults ages 50 to 75 years include home fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy with FOBT, and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A newer test, computed tomographic (CT) colonography, has been recommended by some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, national organizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 2010 National Health Interview Survey data, including new CT colonography questions, from respondents ages 50 to 75 years (N = 8,952) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We (i) assessed prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test use overall, by test type, and by sociodemographic and health care access factors and (ii) assessed reported reasons for not having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-standardized percentage of respondents reporting FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy within recommended time intervals was 58.3% [95% confidence interval (CI), 57.0-59.6] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was the most commonly reported test [within past 10 years: 54.6% (95% CI, 53.2-55.9)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Home FOBT and sigmoidoscopy with FOBT were less frequently used [FOBT within past year: 8.8% (95% CI, 8.1-9.6); sigmoidoscopy within past 5 years with FOBT within past 3 years: 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0-1.6)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT colonography was rare: 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0-1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing age, education, income, having health care insurance, and having a usual source of health care were associated with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Test use within recommended time intervals was particularly low among individuals ages 50 to 64 years without health care insurance [21.2% (95% CI, 18.3-24.4)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common reason for nonuse was "no reason or never thought about it." CONCLUSIONS: About 40% of Americans ages 50 to 75 years do not meet the recommendations for having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Impact: Expanded health care coverage and greater awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening are needed to further decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
