<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To profile hospitals by survival rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in multiple periods after initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry data from 50,544 patients receiving primary surgery with curative intent for stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 1994-1998, supplemented with hospital discharge abstracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We estimated a single Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify associations of survival to 30 days, 30 days to 1 year, and 1-5 years by hospital, adjusted for patient age, sex, race, stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared two profiling methods for 30-day survival and four longer-term profiling methods by the fractions of hospitals with demonstrably superior survival profiles and of hospital pairs whose relative standings could be established confidently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Interperiod correlation coefficients of the random effects are (95 percent credible interval 0.27, 0.85), (0.20, 0.76), and (0.19, 0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three-period model ranks 5.4 percent of pairwise comparisons by 30-day survival with at least 95 percent confidence, versus 3.3 percent of pairs using a single-period model, and 15-20 percent by weighted multiperiod methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The quality of care for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> provided by a hospital system is somewhat consistent across the immediate postoperative and long-term follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combining mortality profiles across longer periods may improve the statistical reliability of outcome comparisons </plain></SENT>
