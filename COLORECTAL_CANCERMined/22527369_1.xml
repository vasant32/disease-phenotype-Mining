<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 53 patients were enrolled from 2007 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Integrated (18)F-FDG-PET/perfusion CT was successful in 45 patients, 35 of whom underwent surgery without intervening treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> SUV(max), SUV(mean) and regional blood flow (BF) were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for CD105 expression and analysis were performed for two hot spots, four hot spots and the Chalkley method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between metabolic flow parameters and CD105 expression were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (SD) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size was 38.5 (20.5) mm, for SUV(max), SUV(mean) and BF it was 19.1 (4.5), 11.6 (2.5) and 85.4 (40.3) mL/min/100 g tissue, and for CD105 microvessel density it was 71.4 (23.6), 66.8 (22.9) and 6.18 (2.07) for two hot spots, four hot spots and the Chalkley method, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive correlation between BF and CD105 expression was modest but higher for Chalkley than for four hot spots analysis (r = 0.38, P = 0.03; r = 0.33, P = 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between metabolic parameters (SUV(max) or SUV(mean)) and CD105 expression (r = 0.08-0.22, P = 0.21-0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The histological analysis method affects correlations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> CD105 expression and BF but not SUV(max) or SUV(mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS: • FDG-PET/perfusion CT offers new surrogate biomarkers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>. • Microvessel density scoring influences histopathological correlations with CT blood flow. • Highest correlations were found with the Chalkley analysis method. • Correlations between SUV and CD105 are not affected by the scoring method </plain></SENT>
