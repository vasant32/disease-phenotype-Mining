<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Evidence indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients have increased thromboembolic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given a potential role of prothrombotic clot phenotype in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, we investigated plasma fibrin clot properties in patients with digestive tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 44 consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi>, including 26 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, versus 47 controls matched for demographics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability (K), turbidimetry (lag phase and maximum absorbance, Î”Abs), and efficiency of fibrinolysis using 3 different measures (CLT, t and maximum rate of d-dimer release from clots, d-D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> had lower K (-11.5%, p=0.016), shorter lag phase (-5%, p=0.019), longer CLT (+17%, p&lt;0.001) and t (+8%, p=0.031), and reduced d-D (-12%, p&lt;0.001) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes were the independent predictor of CLT and t in the patients, while K was independently associated with tissue plasminogen activator but not with TAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patients (n=26) compared with the remainder (n=18), K was lower (p=0.004), and lag phase shorter (p=0.03), while CLT (p=0.012) and t (p=0.008) were longer, suggesting more profound unfavorable alterations in fibrin clots properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to show that patients with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> tend to form less permeable fibrin clots relatively resistant to lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prothrombotic clot phenotype might represent a novel prothrombotic mechanism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
