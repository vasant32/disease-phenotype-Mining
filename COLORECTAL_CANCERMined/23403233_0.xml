<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional +61A&gt;G polymorphism (rs4444903 A&gt;G) in the promoter region of the EGF gene was observed to modulate EGF levels, thus affecting the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e>; but individually published studies showed inconclusive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this Human Genome Epidemiology (HuGE) review and meta-analysis was to derive a more precise estimation of the association between EGF +61A&gt;G polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A literature search of Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Chinese BioMedical databases from inception through July 2012 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve studies were assessed with a total of 2868 gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 4278 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis, the results showed that the G allele and GG genotype of EGF +61A&gt;G polymorphism might increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the stratified analysis by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types, the G allele and GG genotype of EGF +61A&gt;G polymorphism showed displayed significant correlations with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found significant correlations between the G carrier (GG+AG) and GG genotype of EGF +61A&gt;G polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, EGF +61A&gt;G polymorphism did not appear to have an influence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results from the current meta-analysis indicate that EGF +61A&gt;G polymorphism might increase the risk of esophageal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine whether genetic associations between EGF +61A&gt;G polymorphism and susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> are significant </plain></SENT>
