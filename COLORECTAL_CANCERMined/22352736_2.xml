<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microsomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32955">epoxide</z:chebi> hydrolase (EPHX1) has an important role in the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33848">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</z:chebi> and detoxification of procarcinogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) development and EPHX1 gene polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the polymorphisms in exon 3 (T&gt;C, Tyr113His) and exon 4 (A&gt;G, His139Arg) of the EPHX1 gene in 68 CRC patients and 116 controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the Try113Try, Try113His, and His113His for EPHX1 exon 3 were 37.9%, 55.2%, and 6.9% in controls and 39.7%, 42.6%, and 17.6% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of EPHX1 exon 4 genotypes were 62.1% His139His, 37.9% His139Arg, and 0% Arg139Arg in the control group and 76.5% His139His, 22.1% His139Arg, and 1.5% Arg139Arg in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals carrying the EPHX1 exon 3 His113His genotype had a 2.5-fold increased risk (p=0.024), and those carrying the EPHX1 exon 4 His139Arg genotype had decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with controls (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even though exon 3 Tyr113His and exon 4 His139Arg polymorphisms for EPHX1 gene appear to be important factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, further investigations with larger study groups are needed to fully elucidate the role of these polymorphisms in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
