<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a CTC screening program on the number of screening, therapeutic and total colonoscopies performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the quarterly mean numbers of colonoscopic examinations performed for 50-79 year olds undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in 2003, before initiation of a CTC program, to 2011, seven years after the CTC program began at our academic tertiary care facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CTC program began in 2004 with a peak number of 387 CTC examinations performed in the 3rd quarter of 2005 and 275 examinations in the final quarter of 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening colonoscopies increased from 555 mean/quarter in 2003 to 1460 in 2011 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean/quarter number of total colonoscopies performed increased from 1104 in 2003 to 2382 in 2011 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening examinations (Colonoscopy + CTC) increased from 555/quarter in 2003 to 1736 in 2011 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since the initiation of CTC screening at our institution, the overall number of total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening examinations (CTC + colonoscopy) has greatly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The initiation of a CTC screening program did not lead to a reduction in the number of colonoscopic examinations performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a significant increase in the number of screening and total colonoscopies completed was observed </plain></SENT>
