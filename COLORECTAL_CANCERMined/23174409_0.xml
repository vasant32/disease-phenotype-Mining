<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently proposed an S-1 combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (SOXL) regimen, a combination treatment consisting of oral metronomic S-1 dosing and intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (l-OHP) containing PEGylated liposomes, which showed potent antitumor activity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PEGylated liposomes induce what is referred to as the "accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon" upon repeated administration and consequently lose their long-circulating characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon seems to pose an impediment for the clinical application and use of PEGylated liposomal formulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, l-OHP-containing PEGylated liposomes in the SOXL regimen significantly attenuated the ABC phenomenon in a dose-dependent manner through suppression of the anti-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> IgM response, which allowed an enhanced hepatic uptake of subsequently injected test PEGylated liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice, the abrogation of the ABC phenomenon restored intratumor accumulation of subsequently injected PEGylated liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the therapeutic efficacy of the SOXL regimen over the combination of the free form of the drugs was credited not only with the selective delivery of drugs to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue but also with ensuring an adequate accumulation of subsequent doses within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SOXL regimen we proposed may hold promise as a safe and effective treatment regimen for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
