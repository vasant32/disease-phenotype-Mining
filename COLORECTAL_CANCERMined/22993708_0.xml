<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In recent years, the incidence of early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has markedly increased in the population within the Republic of Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathologic features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in TNM stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2003 and September 2009, 168 patients with stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the records of 4,315 members of the general population without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, as determined by colonoscopy during a health check-up, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 168 patients with stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 68 (40.5%) had coexisting colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and of the 4,315 members of the general population, 1,112 (26.0%) had coexisting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> multiplicity in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and in the general population were 32% and 15%, respectively (P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with coexisting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> had a higher frequency of tubulovillous or villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> than members of the general population with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (7.5% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a subgroup analysis showed that the occurrence (44% vs. 34%, P = 0.006) and the multiplicity (32% vs. 15%, P = 0.023) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> were greater for T2 than T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence and the multiplicity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in TNM stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is higher than it is in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study suggest that depth of invasion of early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> affects the prevalence and the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in the remaining colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
