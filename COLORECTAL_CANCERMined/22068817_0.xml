<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomised into two groups: Group A was treated by conventional chemotherapy regimen and Group B was treated by chemotherapy regimen according to the ATP-CRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three chemotherapeutic agents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and irinotecan) were tested by ATP-CRA and more sensitive agents were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between Group A and B, treatment response and resectability were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between November 2008 and October 2010, a total 63 patients were randomised to Group A (N=32) or Group B (N=31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FOLFOX was more preferred in Group A than in Group B (26 out of 32 (81.3%) vs 20 out of 31 (64.5%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group B showed better treatment response than Group A (48.4% vs 21.9%, P=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The resectability of hepatic lesion was higher in Group B (35.5% vs 12.5%, P=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean duration from chemotherapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to the time of liver resection was 11 cycles (range 4-12) in Group A and 8 cycles (range 8-16) in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that tailored-chemotherapy based on ATP-CRA could improve the treatment response and resectability in initially unresectable colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
