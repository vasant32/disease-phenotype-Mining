<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a case of sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (cStage IV) for which preoperative chemotherapy improved the outcome of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 57-year-old man with sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> of sufficient size to block the passage of the endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was found to be widely infiltrated and adherent to the peritoneum over the bladder, with effusion around the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> that made peritoneal disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> a strong possibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, many regional and periaortic lymph nodes were swollen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> at Stage IV was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After preoperative chemotherapy [mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab (Bev)] was administered, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size decreased sufficiently to allow the endoscope to pass through </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effusion around the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> disappeared, and lymph node swellings were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The surgical findings revealed no evidence of peritoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to the peritoneum over the bladder was small, which limited the extent of combined peritonectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, the histopathological diagnosis was Stage II,and histological evaluation of the drug therapy effects was that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was then Grade 1b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although clinical studies are currently conducted on preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, preoperative chemotherapy is not established as standard treatment due to lack of clear evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of the usefulness of preoperative chemotherapy is warrants future clinical studies </plain></SENT>
