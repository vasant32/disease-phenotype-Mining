<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint, with a target median of 10.8 months (35% improvement over FOLFIRI alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one patients started a median of 3 (range 1-11) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> cycles (median relative dose intensity, &lt;60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median PFS was 6.7 months (95% confidence interval, 4.7-9.2) by independent review, 7.2 months (95% confidence interval, 5.4-9.5) by investigator assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Objective response rate (complete responses + partial responses) was 36.6% (independent review) and 42.3% (investigator assessment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical benefit rate (complete responses + partial responses + stable disease) was 83.1% (independent review) and 88.7% (investigator assessment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-causality, any-grade, adverse events were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (both 97.2%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (84.5%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (both 78.9%); decreased appetite (74.6%); and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (66.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>Neutropenia</z:hpo> (96%) was the most frequent grade 3/4 adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study was closed early due to findings from a concurrent phase III study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> + FOLFIRI in non-Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the median PFS for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> + FOLFIRI in Japanese patients was shorter than the 10.8 month target, indicating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> did not add to the antitumor activity of FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
