<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the challenges of proteomics-driven biomarker discovery research is that the bulk of secreted mutant proteins cannot be identified directly and quantified by mass spectrometry due to the lack of mutated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> information in extant proteomics databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we identify, using an integrated genomics and proteomics strategy (referred to iMASp - identification of Mutated And Secreted proteins), 112 putative mutated tryptic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (corresponding to 57 proteins) in the collective secretomes derived from a panel of 18 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Central to this iMASp was the creation of Human Protein Mutant Database (HPMD), against which experimentally-derived secretome <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> spectra were searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the identified mutated tryptic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were confirmed by RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from those <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells from which the mutation was identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The iMASp technology promises to improve the link between proteomics and genomic mutation data thereby providing an effective tool for targeting tryptic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with mutated amino acids as potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biomarker candidates </plain></SENT>
