<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>Aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) are considered to be useful as surrogate biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), but the biological significance of ACF remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to investigate the relationship between the presence of ACF and human colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> using a relatively large sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out high-magnification chromoscopic colonoscopy to identify ACFs in 861 subjects undergoing a diagnostic endoscopy at the Yokohama City University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study compared the prevalence and number of ACFs in three subject groups (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cases, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlations between the demographic and behavioral characteristics of the subjects and the prevalence of ACFs were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of ACF was 64%, 88%, and 95%, and the mean number of ACF was 3.6, 6.2, and 10.1, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cases, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When differences in the prevalence and number of ACFs among age- and sex-stratified subject groups were examined, significant stepwise increments from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cases to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were apparent (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an age- and sex-adjusted multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and alcohol habits had a synergistic effect, increasing the prevalence of ACFs as well as the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that ACF may serve as a reliable surrogate biomarker for human colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: The use of ACF as an endpoint may enable the size, duration, and cost of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> chemoprevention studies to be reduced </plain></SENT>
