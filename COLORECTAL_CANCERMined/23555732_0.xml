<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 420 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 815 controls were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calcium intake was investigated using a 103 item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CASR, rs10934578, rs12485716, rs2270916, and rs4678174, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No SNPs were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk after adjusting for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, no significant effect modification by CASR polymorphisms on the association between calcium intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 of the polymorphisms within the CASR showed significantly higher odds ratios for association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in the low-calcium-intake group compared to the high-calcium-intake group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of rs2270916, individuals with the CC genotype and low calcium intake showed an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk compared to their counterparts with the TT genotype and high calcium intake (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.27-3.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with lower calcium intake exhibited a higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk compared with subjects with the same genotype who had higher calcium intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that individuals who have low dietary calcium intake should be aware of their increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk and prevention strategies </plain></SENT>
