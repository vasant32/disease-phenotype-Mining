<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Smad4â€‘shRNA expression vectors were constructed and stably transfected to HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein of Smad4 and Id2 was detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cellular proliferation inhibitory activity was determined by <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> thiazolyl tetrazolium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transwell assay was used to detect the effect of the inhibition of Smad4-shRNA on migration and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Smad4-shRNA vector, which inhibited Smad4 expression, was constructed and successfully transfected to HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of Smad4 were markedly decreased following transfection of shRNA compared with the control groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion were increased following transfection of shRNA (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of Id2 was increased following transfection of shRNA (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the Smad4-down-regulated HCT116 cells, treated with or without BMP7 (25 ng/ml), no difference was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>shRNA-mediated silencing of Smad4 was able to enhance the abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion in the HCT116 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Smad4 may act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
