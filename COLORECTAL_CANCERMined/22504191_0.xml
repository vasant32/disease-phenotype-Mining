<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a scoring system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel dysfunction</z:e> after low anterior resection (LAR) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, on the basis of symptoms and impact on quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: LAR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> often results in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel dysfunction</z:e> (LAR syndrome [LARS]) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e>, urgency, and frequent bowel movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have investigated functional outcome, but the terminology is inconsistent hereby complicating comparison of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Questionnaires regarding bowel function was sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 1143 LAR patients eligible for inclusion identified in the national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between items and QoL were computed by binomial regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The important items were selected and regression analysis was performed to find the adjusted risk ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individual score values were designated items to form the LARS score, which was divided into "no LARS," "minor LARS," and "major LARS." Validity was tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Spearman's rank correlation and discriminant validity was tested by Student t tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 961 patients returned completed questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5 most important items were "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> for flatus," "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> for liquid stools," "frequency," "clustering," and "urgency." The range (0-42) was divided into 0 to 20 (no LARS), 21 to 29 (minor LARS), and 30 to 42 (major LARS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The score showed good correlation and a high sensitivity (72.54%) and specificity (82.52%) for major LARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Discriminant validity showed significant differences between groups with and without radiotherapy (P &lt; 0.0001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> height more or less than 5 cm (P &lt; 0.0001), and total mesorectal excision/partial mesorectal excision (P = 0.0163) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have constructed a valid and reliable LARS score correlated to QoL--a simple tool for quick clinical evaluation of the severity of LARS </plain></SENT>
