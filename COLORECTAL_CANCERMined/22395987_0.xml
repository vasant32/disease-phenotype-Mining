<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The definition of a safe future liver remnant (FLR) volume based on preoperative clinical data in these patients is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify predictors of postoperative morbidities in patients undergoing major hepatectomy after intensive preoperative chemotherapy for CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2000 and August 2010, a total of 101 consecutive patients with CLM underwent major hepatectomy after preoperative chemotherapy (â‰¥6 cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> or irinotecan regimen with or without targeted therapies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FLR ratio was calculated by two formulas: actual FLR (aFLR) ratio, and standardized FLR (sFLR) ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictors of postoperative overall morbidity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (57.4%) had 95 postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>Sepsis</z:hpo> and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> occurred in 23 (22.8%) and 16 patients (15.8%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, small aFLR ratio was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> complications, and sFLR ratio was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the cutoff of aFLR ratio in predicting overall morbidity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> was 44.8, 43.1, and 37.7%, respectively, and that of sFLR ratio in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> was 43.6 and 48.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, these aFLR and sFLR ratio cutoffs were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> complications and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a cutoff FLR ratio for safe postoperative outcome after major hepatectomy in CLM patients receiving six or more cycles of preoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
