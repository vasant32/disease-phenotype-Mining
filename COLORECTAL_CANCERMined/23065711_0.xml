<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of the candidate gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was validated in 86 patients using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of the protein encoded by the candidate gene was assessed using immunohistochemical staining of tissue from 269 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between protein expression and clinicopathologic features was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following combined copy number and gene expression analyses, three genes linked to distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were extracted as candidate biomarkers </plain></SENT>
