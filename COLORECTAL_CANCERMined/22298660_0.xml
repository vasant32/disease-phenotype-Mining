<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has introduced the new challenge of ensuring patient adherence to therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data regarding self-reported adherence, beliefs about medicines, side effects, and satisfaction with information received about <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-adherence was reported by 23.3% of the 43 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> therapy was perceived necessary by 97.6%, but almost one-third of participants had strong concerns </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> is high with a strong conviction that the therapy is necessary </plain></SENT>
