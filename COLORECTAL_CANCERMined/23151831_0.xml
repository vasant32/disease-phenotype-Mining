<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the effect of computer-aided detection (CAD) as a second reader on the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomographic (CT) colonography in detecting 6-9-mm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals with clinical indications for colonoscopy--either for symptoms or as part of participating in a surveillance program or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening--were prospectively enrolled at one of 10 academic centers between July 2007 and May 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Institutional review board approval was obtained at each clinical site, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants provided written informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent CT colonography and colonoscopy on the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experienced readers interpreted the CT colonography images unassisted and then reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colorectal lesion-like structures pinpointed by the CAD algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Segmental unblinding of CT colonoscopy findings at colonoscopy was utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of unassisted and CAD-assisted reading in identifying individuals with 6-9-mm lesions were calculated and compared by means of pairwise analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 618 participants (mean age, 57.9 years; 54.5% male) were included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these participants, 464 (75.1%) had no lesions 6 mm or larger, and 52 (8.4%) had 6-9-mm lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of CT colonography with unassisted reading and that with CAD-assisted reading in identifying individuals with 6-9-mm lesions was 65.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 50.9%, 78.0%) and 76.9% (95% CI: 63.2%, 87.5%; P = .016), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant change in specificity was observed: The specificity of CT colonography with unassisted and that with CAD-assisted reading was 91.8% (95% CI: 88.9%, 94.1%) and 90.9% (95% CI: 88.0%, 93.4%; P = .063), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of CAD candidates required an additional 1.6 minutes (25th-75th percentile: 1.0 minute to 3.4 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of CAD to reading performed by experienced readers resulted in a significant benefit in the detection of 6-9-mm <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> at CT colonography in this cohort </plain></SENT>
