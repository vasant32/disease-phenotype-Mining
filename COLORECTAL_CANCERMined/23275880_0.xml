<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interactions among susceptibility modifier loci make many of the loci difficult to detect in human genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous analyses in mice have used classical inbred strains, which share large portions of their genomes due to common ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we used an interspecific backcross between the Mus musculus strain A/J and the Mus spretus strain SPRET/EiJ to map 6 additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> modifier loci (Scc16-21) and 2 suggestive loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three loci modify the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> along the proximal-distal axis of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> modifiers previously mapped in intraspecific crosses were also replicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This work confirms genetic models suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is caused by many small effect alleles and brings the catalog of reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> modifier loci to 23 spread across 13 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this work provides the foundation for large population-level epistatic interaction tests to identify combinations of low effect alleles that may have large effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
