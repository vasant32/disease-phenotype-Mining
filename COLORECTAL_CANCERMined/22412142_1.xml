<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The activity and mechanism of action of the combination of cetuximab plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> were investigated in vitro in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the clinical study, patients with chemotherapy-refractory mCRC were treated with cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) as a loading dose and then weekly cetuximab 250 mg/m(2) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> 100 mg orally daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was response rate (RR), which was evaluated separately in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) versus KRAS mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Target accrual was 50 patients, with a one-stage design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preclinical studies demonstrated synergistic activity of cetuximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> cotreatment on growth inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines both as a result of enhanced inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway and differential effects on STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the clinical study, 50 patients were enrolled, with 48 patients evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall RR was 31% (95% CI, 26% to 57%), with a median PFS of 4.6 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RR was 41% (95% CI, 26% to 57%) in KRAS WT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, with a median PFS of 5.6 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no response in 11 patients with KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frequent grade 3 and 4 toxicities were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (48%), hypomagnesaemia (18%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of cetuximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> synergistically inhibits growth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, achieves promising efficacy in patients with KRAS WT mCRC, and merits evaluation in further randomized studies </plain></SENT>
