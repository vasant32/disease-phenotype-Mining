<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An antimicrobial dressing containing ionic silver was found effective in reducing surgical-site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in a preliminary study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We decided to test this finding in a randomized, double-blind trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adults undergoing elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery at two university-affiliated hospitals were randomly assigned to have the surgical incision dressed with Aquacel Ag Hydrofiber dressing or a common dressing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To blind the patient and the nursing and medical staff to the nature of the dressing used, scrub nurses covered Aquacel Ag Hydrofiber with a common wound dressing in the experimental arm, whereas a double common dressing was applied to patients of control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point of the study was the occurrence of any surgical-site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> within 30 days of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 112 patients (58 in the experimental arm and 54 in the control group) qualified for primary end-point analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the patient population and their surgical procedures were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of surgical-site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was lower in the experimental group (11.1% center 1, 17.5% center 2; overall 15.5%) than in controls (14.3% center 1, 24.2% center 2, overall 20.4%), but the observed difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.451), even with respect to surgical-site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> grade 1 (superficial) versus grades 2 and 3, or grade 1 and 2 versus grade 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This randomized trial did not confirm a statistically significant superiority of Aquacel Ag Hydrofiber dressing in reducing surgical-site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> after elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
