<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations of polymorphisms in NAT1, NAT2, GSTA1, SULT1A1, CYP1A2, UGT1A7, UGT1A9, GSTP1 genes with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk were investigated in a nested case-control study of the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort including 428 cases matched by age, sex and year of recruitment with one or two controls (n=828) with negative colonoscopy per case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genoyping was preformed with the Sequenom MassArray system and the LightCycler 480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For rs15561 (NAT1) and rs1057126 (NAT1), the rarer allel was significantly inversely associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk OR=0.80 (95% CI 0.65-0.97) and (OR=0.81 (95% CI 0.65-0.99) and, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the combined NAT2 alleles encoding for enzymes with medium (versus slow) activity we also observed a significantly inverse association with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk (OR=0.75; 95% CI 0.85-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, homozygous carriers of the A allele of rs3957357 (GSTA1), i.e., those with a decreased enzyme activity, had a decreased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> with an OR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.50-0.92; AA versus GG/GA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in the other tested genes did not modify the risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, polymorphisms in NAT1, NAT2, and GSTA1 are related to colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk in this German cohort </plain></SENT>
