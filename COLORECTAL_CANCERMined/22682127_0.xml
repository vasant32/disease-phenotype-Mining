<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the RIETE Registry data to compare the clinical characteristics, treatment strategies and outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with unsuspected PE and in those presenting with symptomatic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Up to December 2011, 78 cancer patients with unsuspected PE and 1,994 with symptomatic PE had been enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with unsuspected PE more likely had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> than those with symptomatic PE (28% vs. 13%), and less likely had prostate (3.8% vs. 10%) or hematologic (1.3% vs. 6.4%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, or prior venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (3.8% vs. 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the patients were receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, the incidence of PE recurrences (0% vs. 1.9%) or major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (2.6% vs. 4.8%) were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After completion of anticoagulation, recurrent PE developed in 2.6% vs. 1.4% of patients, and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 0% vs. 0.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the clinical characteristics and outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with unsuspected PE are quite similar to those in patients with symptomatic PE </plain></SENT>
