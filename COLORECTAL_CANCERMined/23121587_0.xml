<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> trial activity from 1 January 2005 to 1 July 2011 in Australia and internationally, followed by a consensus meeting of consumers, health care professionals, researchers and funding agencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of Phase III and randomised clinical trials in the areas of prevention, screening, surgery, adjuvant therapy, advanced disease and behavioural interventions, and priority areas of research identified by participants at the consensus meeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The registry search identified 76 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> clinical trials (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases) registered in Australia from 1 January 2005 to 1 July 2011, of which 51 were Phase III or randomised, and 323 Phase III and randomised trials registered worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Australia, most trials were in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (32), screening (10), and behavioural interventions (9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Worldwide, most Phase III or randomised trials were in advanced disease (94, 29.1%), surgery (64, 19.8%), behavioural interventions (38, 11.8%), and screening (30, 9.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the consensus meeting, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participant groups emphasised the need for research in secondary prevention, screening, individualised treatments and follow-up care after treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a mismatch between the high proportion of registered trials in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the areas of priority identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The development of specific trials in these priority areas depends on the availability of funding and the existence of plausible interventions likely to improve patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
