<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we systematically investigated the impact of ECM on phenotype, gene expression, EGFR signaling pathway, and on EGFR inhibition in commonly used <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LrECM on-top (3D) culture assays were performed with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines SW-480, HT-29, DLD-1, LOVO, CACO-2, COLO-205 and COLO-206F </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of cells was examined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, invasive capacity of the cell lines was assayed using Matrigel-coated Boyden chambers, and migratory activity was determined employing the Fence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differential gene expression was analyzed at the transcriptional level by the Agilent array platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EGFR was inhibited by using the specific small molecule inhibitor AG1478 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A specific spheroid growth pattern was observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DLD-1, HT-29 and SW-480 and CACO-2 exhibited a clear <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> cell formation, while LOVO, COLO-205 and COLO-206F were characterized by forming grape-like structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the occurrence of a spheroid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> did not correlate with an altered migratory, invasive, or proliferative capacity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, gene expression was clearly altered in cells grown on lrECM as compared to 2D cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cell lines, inhibition of EGFR was less effective in lrECM (3D) cultures as compared to 2D cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, comparing both 2D and 3D cell culture models, our data support the influence of the ECM on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to conventional 2D cell culture, the lrECM (3D) cell culture model offers the opportunity to investigate permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines under more physiological conditions, i.e. in the context of molecular therapeutic targets and their pharmacological inhibition </plain></SENT>
