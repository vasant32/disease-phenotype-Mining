<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC), KRAS is the only validated biomarker used to select patients for administration of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify additional predictive markers, we investigated the importance of HER2, the primary EGFR dimerisation partner, in this particular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the HER2 gene status by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in 170 KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mCRC patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Depending on HER2 gene copy number status, patients showed three distinct cytogenetic profiles: 4% of patients had HER2 gene amplification (R:HER2/CEP17 â‰¥ 2) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neoplastic cells (HER2-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-A), 61% of patients had HER2 gain due to polysomy or to gene amplification in minor clones (HER2-FISH+*), and 35% of patients had no or slight HER2 gain (HER2-FISH-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These subgroups were significantly correlated with different clinical behaviours, in terms of response rate (RR; P=0.0006), progression-free survival (PFS; P&lt;0.0001) and overall survival (OS; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with HER2-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-A profile experienced the worst outcome, patients with HER2-FISH- profile showed an intermediate behaviour and patients with HER2-FISH+* profile were related to the highest survival probability (median PFS in months: 2.5 vs 3.9 vs 7.6, respectively; median OS in months: 4.2 vs 9.7 vs 13, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HER2 gene copy number status may influence the clinical response to anti-EGFR-targeted therapy in mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
