<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abrogation of this pathway is implicated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic value of β-catenin/E-cadherin complex in Tunisian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> from 150 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were stained for β-catenin and E-cadherin by using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion of exon 3 of CTNNB1 gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that β-catenin and E-cadherin expressions were related inversely to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the nuclear expression of β-catenin was considerably increased in advanced colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and was highly associated with shorter survival of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deletion of exon 3 of CTNNB1 was identified in 2 cases by using polymerase chain reaction and was significantly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion and aberrant expression of E-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major finding of this study is that activation of β-catenin gene by deletions involving exon 3 may be considered as an advanced event in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in Tunisian patients, in contrast to some worldwide studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, disruption of β-catenin/E-cadherin complex may be considered as a dependent predictor of disease outcome </plain></SENT>
