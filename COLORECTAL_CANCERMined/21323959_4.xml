<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens were assigned randomly to either dissection with intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> injection or to routine dissection (without <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> injection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately postoperatively, the specimens in the staining group were injected intra-arterially with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two procedures were compared with respect to the number of lymph nodes recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of recovered lymph nodes was significantly higher in the intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> injection group than in the group investigated with routine procedures (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> injection method is fairly easy to use postoperatively and increases significantly the number of lymph nodes recovered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
