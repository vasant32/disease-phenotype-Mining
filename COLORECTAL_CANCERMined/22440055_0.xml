<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The c-statistic is a popular tool used to judge model performance, but can be limited, particularly when evaluating specific operations in focused populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to examine the interpretation and relevance of the c-statistic when used in models with increasingly similar case mix and to consider an alternative perspective on model calibration based on a graphical depiction of model fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: From the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (2008-2009), patients were identified who underwent a general surgery procedure, and procedure groups were increasingly restricted: colorectal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, colorectal-elective cases only, and colorectal-elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality and serious morbidity outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression-based risk adjustment, and model c-statistics and calibration curves were used to compare model performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 323,427 general, 47,605 colorectal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 39,860 colorectal-elective, and 21,680 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality ranged from 1.0% in general surgery to 4.1% in the colorectal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> group, and serious morbidity ranged from 3.9% in general surgery to 12.4% in the colorectal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedural group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As case mix was restricted, c-statistics progressively declined from the general to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery cohorts for both mortality and serious morbidity (mortality: 0.949 to 0.866; serious morbidity: 0.861 to 0.668) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calibration was evaluated graphically by examining predicted vs observed number of events over risk deciles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For both mortality and serious morbidity, there was no qualitative difference in calibration identified between the procedure groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we demonstrate how the c-statistic can become less informative and, in certain circumstances, can lead to incorrect model-based conclusions, as case mix is restricted and patients become more homogenous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although it remains an important tool, caution is advised when the c-statistic is advanced as the sole measure of a model performance </plain></SENT>
