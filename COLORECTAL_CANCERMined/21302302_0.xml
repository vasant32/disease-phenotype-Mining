<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the endogenous IL-23 expression has been reported to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and growth, the studies using local and systemic administration of IL-23 have shown that its application at the excessive amount induces antitumor immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-23 is, today, considered the key driver of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and its role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> is tissue-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of circulating levels of IL-23 in patients with resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) before and after chemotherapy, respect to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients were enrolled between June 2007 and January 2009, and followed through 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent chemotherapy, mostly FOLFOX4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-sex and age-matched healthy donors were recruited as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-23 serum concentrations, measured by a quantitative enzyme immunoassay technique, were significantly higher in patients with resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (26.02 ± 28.63 pg/ml versus 7.1 ± 6.4 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.001) and after chemotherapy respect to controls (21.74 ± 23.82 pg/ml versus 7.17 ± 6.43 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase was documented also before chemotherapy (26.02 ± 28.63 pg/ml versus 21.74 ± 23.82 pg/ml, P = 0.7) but not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This work investigated, for the first time, the role of IL-23 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> resection and chemotherapy, showing no correlation with the severity of disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> removal, and chemotherapeutic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, other works are needed to better clarify if IL-23 could be considered a key-molecule in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and a target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
