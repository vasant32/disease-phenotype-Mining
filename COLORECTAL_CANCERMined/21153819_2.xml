<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the risk factors affecting the development of MLM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients following curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,356 patients who underwent curative intent resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, those who with 30 days postoperative mortality (n=23), incomplete medical record (n=32), synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (n=148) and UICC stage IV (n=54) were excluded, and finally 1,099 patients were analyzed, including 977 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> and 122 patients with MLM-only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and pathological records for each patient were reviewed from medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathologic characteristics of 1,099 patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median timing of developing MLM was 13 months with a range of 4 to 79 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis identified that preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, depth of invasion, lymph nodes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, vascular invasion, and perineural invasion were significantly correlated with the development of MLM (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, a multivariate analysis showed that preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level&gt;5 ng/ml (Odds Ratio [OR]=1.591; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.065-2.377; P=0.024), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> depth (OR=2.294; 95% CI, 1.103-4.768; P=0.026), positive lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (OR=2.004; 95% CI, 1.324-3.031; P=0.001) and positive vascular invasion (OR=1.872; 95% CI, 1.225-2.861; P=0.004) were independent prognostic factors contributing to the occurrence of MLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that preoperative serum CEA level, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> depth, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and positive vascular invasion could affect the occurrence of MLM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients following curative resection, and thus could help to define these high-risk patients who would benefit from enhanced surveillance and therapeutic program(s) </plain></SENT>
