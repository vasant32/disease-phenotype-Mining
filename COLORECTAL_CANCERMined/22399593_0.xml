<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have suggested that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-inhibiting antibody cetuximab may have better effect in the third-line treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, after failure of standard chemotherapy including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, compared to using it up-front in the first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reason behind this suggestion is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of cetuximab on cell growth was investigated in five isogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines with increasing level of acquired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of EGFR and the activity of down-stream signalling molecules were measured by western blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A marked increase in sensitivity to cetuximab, accompanied by an up-regulation of EGFR, was observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-resistant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The connection between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> resistance and cetuximab sensitivity has not been previously reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such a connection could be of clinical importance and constitutes a substantial an argument for saving cetuximab until later treatment lines, when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> have become chemotherapy resistant </plain></SENT>
