<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our genome consists to about 8% of human endogenous retroviral (HERV) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These HERVs have been discussed to be linked to human diseases for decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a detailed analysis of a HERV-H sequence located on chromosome Xp22.3 revealed a strong expression in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> whereas expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> entities was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used the reverse immunology approach to test the immunological potential of this HERV-H ORF on Xp22.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of ten <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> displaying HLA-A2.1-binding motifs were selected from the predicted env protein sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of peripheral T cells with retroviral <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (RVPs) presented by autologous antigen-presenting cells clearly resulted in sustained proliferation of predominantly CD8(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High numbers of IFN-Î³-secreting T cells were detectable after several weekly stimulations with RVP mixes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reactivity observed in RVP-Mix-stimulated cultures was attributable to RVP03, RVP09 and to a lower extend to RVP08, suggesting those to be highly immunogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides killing of RVP-loaded target cells, up to 40% specific lysis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines endogenously expressing this HERV-H Xp22.3 ORF was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that human T cells can be sensitized toward HERV <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and moreover posses a high lytic potential toward HERV-H expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these data hint toward endogenous ENV protein expression followed by proteasomal degradation and presentation in the context of HLA molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, our data strengthen the view that HERV-encoded sequences should be considered as a new class of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antigens </plain></SENT>
