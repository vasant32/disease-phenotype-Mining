<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first step of the C-HPP project is to find evidence of expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proteins encoded on each chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C-HPP also prioritizes particular protein subsets, such as those with post-translational modifications (PTMs) and those found in low abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As participants in C-HPP, we integrated proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis results from chromosome-independent biomarker discovery research to create a chromosome-based list of proteins and phosphorylation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were integrated from five independent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) samples (three types of clinical tissue and two types of cell lines) and lead to the identification of 11,278 proteins, including 8,305 phosphoproteins and 28,205 phosphorylation sites; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these were categorized on a chromosome-by-chromosome basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 3,033 "missing proteins", i.e., proteins that currently lack evidence by mass spectrometry, in the neXtProt database and 12,852 unknown phosphorylation sites not registered in the PhosphoSitePlus database were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our in-depth phosphoproteomic study represents a significant contribution to C-HPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the data set identifier PXD000089 </plain></SENT>
