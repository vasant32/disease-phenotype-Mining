<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab is a chimeric antibody approved for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> that selectively targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment efficacy with this drug is often impaired by acquired resistance and poor information has been accumulated on the mechanisms underlying such a phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By taking advantage of a syngenic cellular system of sensitivity and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> GEO cell line, we profiled protein expression differences between Cetuximab-sensitive and -resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined 2D DIGE and MS analyses revealed a main proteomic signature resulting from selective deregulation of various metabolic enzymes, including <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase B, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase E1, which was also confirmed by Western blotting experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase B downregulation has been already related to an increased anaerobic utilization of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells; accordingly, we verified that Cetuximab-resistant cells have a significantly higher production of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resistant cells also showed decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Observed protein deregulations were not related to functional alterations of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor 1-associated pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that increased anaerobic metabolism is a prominent feature observed in the GEO syngenic model of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
