<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of serum levels of soluble form of endoglin in stage III colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients for detection of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The case-control study consisted of 80 stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who underwent surgery with curative intent and 70 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of soluble form of endoglin (sol-end) were measured in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, predictive factors of recurrence were evaluated using multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of sol-end in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were significantly higher than those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was not a significant association between serum levels of sol-end and clinicopathological features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed the LNR (hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.46-4.34; p &lt; 0.001), to be significant independent factors to estimate local recurrence in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preoperative serum levels of sol-end do not seem useful as a marker for detection of recurrence in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
