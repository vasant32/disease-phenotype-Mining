<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Germline DNA copy number variation (CNV) has recently been implicated in predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo> as well as prostate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the role of germline CNVs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> susceptibility, in particular those with low population frequencies (rare CNVs), which are more likely to cause disease." METHODS: Using whole-genome comparative genomic hybridization on microarrays, we screened a cohort of women fulfilling criteria for hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> who did not carry BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median numbers of total and rare CNVs per genome were not different between controls and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 26 rare germline CNVs were identified in 68 cancer patients, however, a proportion that was significantly different (P = 0.0311) from the control group (23 rare CNVs in 100 individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several of the genes affected by CNV in patients and controls had already been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to explore the contribution of germline CNVs to BRCA1/2-negative familial and early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that rare CNVs may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> predisposition in this small cohort of patients, and this trend needs to be confirmed in larger population samples </plain></SENT>
