<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We speculated that miR-143 and miR-145 might also be downregulated and contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of colonic epithelium in longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies were obtained 20 cm proximal to the anus from individuals with quiescent UC and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and proteins were extracted and measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>miR-143 and miR-145 were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and miR-145 was also assessed by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Putative targets of these miRNAs, K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, API5, MEK-2 (miR-143), and IRS-1 (miR-145) were determined by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess the effects of miR-143 and miR-145 on these predicted targets, HCT116 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>-7 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells were transfected with miR-143 and miR-145 and expression levels of these proteins were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In UC, miR-143 and miR-145 were significantly downregulated 8.3-fold (3.4-20.1) (P &lt; 0.0001) and 4.3-fold (2.3-7.8) (P &lt; 0.0001), respectively, compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IRS-1, K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, API5, and MEK-2 were upregulated in UC, consistent with their assignments as targets of these miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, transfected miR-143 and miR-145 significantly downregulated these proteins in HCT116 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> UC miR-143 and miR-145 were significantly downregulated and their predicted targets, IRS-1, K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, API5, and MEK-2 were upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We postulate that loss of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor miRNAs predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in IBD </plain></SENT>
