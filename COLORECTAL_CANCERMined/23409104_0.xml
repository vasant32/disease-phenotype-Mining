<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Manuka honey has been recognized for its anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and wound-healing activity but its potential antitumor effect is poorly studied despite the fact that it contains many <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative activity of manuka honey on three different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> (B16.F1) and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (CT26) as well as human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (MCF-7) cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that manuka honey has potent anti-proliferative effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner, being effective at concentrations as low as 0.6% (w/v) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect is mediated via the activation of a caspase 9-dependent apoptotic pathway, leading to the induction of caspase 3, reduced Bcl-2 expression, DNA fragmentation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells with manuka and paclitaxel in vitro, however, revealed no evidence of a synergistic action on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we utilized an in vivo syngeneic mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> model to assess the potential effect of intravenously-administered manuka honey, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, on the growth of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that systemic administration of manuka honey was not associated with any alterations in haematological or clinical chemistry values in serum of treated mice, demonstrating its safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with manuka honey alone resulted in about 33% inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, which correlated with histologically observable increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although better control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> was observed in animals treated with paclitaxel alone or in combination with manuka honey (61% inhibition), a dramatic improvement in host survival was seen in the co-treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This highlights a potentially novel role for manuka honey in alleviating chemotherapy-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
