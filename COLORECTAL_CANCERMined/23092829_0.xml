<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol oxidation products, termed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterols</z:chebi>, have been shown to be more reactive than unoxidized cholesterol, possessing marked pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects in a number of cells and tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">Oxysterols</z:chebi>, absorbed with the diet as products of cholesterol auto-oxidation, have recently been suggested to potentially interfere with homeostasis of the mucosal intestinal epithelium, by promoting and sustaining irreversible damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with a diet-compatible mixture of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterols</z:chebi> does not elicit the same responses than individual components added to the cells at the same concentrations at which they are present in the mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterol</z:chebi> mixture showed a slight pro-apoptotic effect on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> CaCo-2 cell line, evaluated in terms of caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation; conversely, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol and 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol were identified to be able to induce a significant pro-apoptotic effect if added to cell culture singly; 7β-hydroxycholesterol had stronger action than other compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhanced production of reactive oxygen species through up-regulation of the colonic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase isoform NOX1 appeared to be the key event in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterol</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As regards pro-inflammatory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterols</z:chebi>, IL-8 and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 were evaluated for their chemotactic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 production was significantly induced by 7β-hydroxycholesterol, as well as by cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterol</z:chebi> mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterol</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> appeared to be NOX1-independent, suggesting a secondary role of this enzyme in inducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A selective cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterols</z:chebi> against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, mainly exploiting their ability to activate NOX1 in generating oxidative reactions, might represent a promising field of investigation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and might bring new insights on strategies in anticancer therapy </plain></SENT>
