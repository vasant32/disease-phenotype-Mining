<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Establishing a simple method for quickly assessing the educational level of patients and modulating a questionnaire for each type of patient, may be an effective protocol to increase the people participation, mainly in countries where sufficient medical resources and financial support are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, the knowledge directly affects the feasibility when screening is offered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient educational level influences the understanding of the knowledge and the screening method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This factor may affect patient's priority level on the study participation, the understanding of questions, and the motivation to complete the questionnaire and, consequently, the screening success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have found a relationship between high educational level and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening participation, and emphasized the questionnaire ineffectiveness in the illiterate people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the questionnaire is an excellent method for this kind of evaluation, physician's contribution could be the most important factor associated with the screening method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, further studies should be conducted to explore the compliance of patients with low educational level and to look for the best solutions for their enrollment </plain></SENT>
