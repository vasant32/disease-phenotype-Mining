<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A recently identified germline mutation G84E in HOXB13 was shown to increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a family-based analysis by The International Consortium for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>Prostate Cancer</z:hpo> Genetics (ICPCG), the G84E mutation was most prevalent in families from the Nordic countries of Finland (22.4%) and Sweden (8.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To further investigate the importance of G84E in the Finns, we determined its frequency in more than 4,000 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> cases and 5,000 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 986 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and 442 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cases were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was conducted using TaqMan, MassARRAY iPLEX, and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were conducted using Fisher exact test, and overall survival was analyzed using Cox modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the G84E mutation was significantly higher among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and highest among patients with a family history of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, hereditary</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> [8.4% vs. 1.0% in controls; OR 8.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.9-15.7] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation contributed significantly to younger age (≤55 years) at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and high prostate-specific antigen (PSA; ≥20 ng/mL) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An association with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> risk in patients with prior benign prostate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (BPH) diagnosis was also revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant evidence for a contribution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was detected, but a suggestive role for the mutation was observed in familial BRCA1/2-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk associated with the G84E mutation in the Finnish population, particularly for early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and cases with substantially elevated PSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Impact: This study confirms the overall importance of the HOXB13 G84E mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
