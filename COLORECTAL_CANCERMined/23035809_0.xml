<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, long-term results concerning laparoscopic resection versus open hepatectomy for stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> are still limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to compare the survival outcome of laparoscopic liver resection with open liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between October 2002 and September 2011, a total of 1697 patients underwent liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumour</z:e> and 60 patients underwent pure laparoscopic liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had laparoscopic resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case-matched control patients who received open liver resection were included for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immediate operative outcomes and survival outcomes including operation morbidity were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients underwent laparoscopic resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty patients who had open hepatectomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were selected as case control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparing the laparoscopic group with the open resection group, the median operating time was 180 min versus 210 min P = 0.059, the median blood loss was 200 versus 310 mL (P = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hospital stay was 4.5 versus 7 days (P = 0.021), disease-free survival was 9.8 versus 10.9 months (P = 0.299), and the median survival was 69.4 versus 42.1 months (P = 0.235) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic liver resection is a safe and effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stay when compared with open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival is comparable to the conventional open approach </plain></SENT>
