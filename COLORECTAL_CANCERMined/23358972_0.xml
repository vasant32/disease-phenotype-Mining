<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE This double-blind, phase III study aimed to demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> plus FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan) was superior to placebo plus FOLFIRI in previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI and either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> (37.5 mg per day) or placebo (4 weeks on treatment, followed by 2 weeks off [schedule 4/2]) until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included overall survival, safety, and patient-reported outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation between genotype and clinical outcomes was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 768 patients were randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> plus FOLFIRI (n = 386) or placebo plus FOLFIRI (n = 382) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following a second prespecified interim analysis, the study was stopped because of potential futility of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> plus FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Final results are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PFS hazard ratio was 1.095 (95% CI, 0.892 to 1.344; one-sided stratified log-rank P = .807), indicating a lack of superiority for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> plus FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median PFS for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> arm was 7.8 months (95% CI, 7.1 to 8.4 months) versus 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2 months) for the placebo arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">Sunitinib</z:chebi> plus FOLFIRI was associated with more grade â‰¥ 3 adverse events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001939'>laboratory abnormalities</z:hpo> than placebo (especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>/oral syndromes, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> as a result of toxicity (12 v four) and significantly more dose delays, dose reductions, and treatment discontinuations occurred in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">Sunitinib</z:chebi> 37.5 mg per day (schedule 4/2) plus FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFIRI alone and has a poorer safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This combination regimen is not recommended for previously untreated mCRC </plain></SENT>
