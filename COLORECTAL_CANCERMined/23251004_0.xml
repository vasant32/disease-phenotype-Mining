<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: CD44 is of functional importance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598935" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor initiation</z:e> and progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but how this molecule benefits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated macrophages (TAM), remains poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vivo tumorigenic assays were conducted to assess the role of murine TAMs in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both in vitro and in vivo osteopontin (OPN) expression levels in TAMs were examined by immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Soft agar colony formation assays were used to estimate the clonogenicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells that had received different treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationships between the expression levels of OPN, CD44v6, and CD68 and clinical prognosis were evaluated by tissue microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that macrophages, when coinjected or cocultured with CD44-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, were able to produce higher levels of OPN, which in turn facilitated the tumorigenicity and clonogenicity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The knockdown of CD44 or treatment with blocking antibodies to CD44 attenuated OPN secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OPN, through binding to its receptor CD44, activated c-jun-NH(2)-kinase signaling and promoted the clonogenicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, tissue microarray data have shown that OPN expression, in combination with CD44v6, has a negative correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the OPN-CD44 interaction is important for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
