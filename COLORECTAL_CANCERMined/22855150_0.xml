<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This consensus statement thus provides an opportunity to improve healthcare efficiency and resource use, which will benefit these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the currently available data on this subject, this expert group recommends testing for microsatellite instability (MSI) in patients with localised <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, as this is a strong predictive factor for deciding on adjuvant treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, although the ColoPrint(®) and Oncotype Dx(®) gene expression signatures have been shown to have prognostic value, no consensus yet exists concerning their use in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, it is essential to test for KRAS mutation status before administering an anti-EGFR treatment, such as cetuximab or panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, testing for other biomarkers, such as BRAF, EGFR, PI3K and PTEN mutations, should not be done routinely, because this does not influence treatment planning at the present time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other important issues addressed include organisational requirements and the quality controls needed for proper testing of these biomarkers as well as the legal implications to be borne in mind when testing some biomarkers </plain></SENT>
