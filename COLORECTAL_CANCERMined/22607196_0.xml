<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to its low response and high toxicity, synergistic effects of 5-FU in combination with other drugs have been widely researched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether oroxylin A improved the sensitivity of HT-29 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A correlation between COX-2 inhibition by oroxylin A and a synergistic effect of 5-FU on the growth of HT-29 cells was observed, and a COX-2 pathway for this effect was recognized; oroxylin A evidently elevated the level of reactive oxygen species in HT-29 cells, which subsequently inhibited COX-2 expression and enhanced the susceptibility of HT-29 cells to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likely also related to COX-2 inhibition, oroxylin A decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) levels in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The synergistic effect of 5-FU induced by oroxylin A was also found in the suppression of Bcl-2 and in the activation of P53, Bax, PARP, and procaspase-3 proteins in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, a combination of 5-FU with oroxylin A significantly reduced the growth of HT-29 tumors in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice compared with treatment with 5-FU or oroxylin A alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a combination of 5-FU and oroxylin A has a significant synergistic effect in the inhibition of HT-29 cell proliferation in vitro and controls HT-29 tumor growth in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This synergistic effect may be mainly related to COX-2 inhibition by oroxylin A in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
