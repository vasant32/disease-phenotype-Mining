<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Much effort in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> research has focused on the tiny part of our genome that codes for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has recently been recognized that microRNAs also contribute decisively to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies have also shown that epigenetic silencing by CpG island hypermethylation of microRNAs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor activities is a common feature of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The importance of other classes of non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, is also gaining recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we wondered whether there were other ncRNAs undergoing CpG island hypermethylation-associated inactivation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We focused on the small nucleolar <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (snoRNAs), a subset of ncRNA with a wide variety of cellular functions, such as chemical modification of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, pre-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing and control of alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By data mining snoRNA databases and the scientific literature, we selected 49 snoRNAs that had a CpG island within â‰¤ 2 Kb or that were processed from a host gene with a 5'-CpG island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi> genomic sequencing of multiple clones in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line HCT-116 showed that 46 snoRNAs were equally methylated in the two samples: completely unmethylated (n = 26) or fully methylated (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, the host gene-associated 5'-CpG islands of the snoRNAs SNORD123, U70C and ACA59B were hypermethylated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells but not in the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CpG island hypermethylation was associated with the transcriptional silencing of the respective snoRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results of a DNA methylation microarray platform in a comprehensive collection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> demonstrated that the observed hypermethylation of snoRNAs was a common feature of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types, particularly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, our findings indicate the existence of a new subclass of ncRNAs, snoRNAs, that are targeted by epigenetic inactivation in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
