<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate short-term and oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic resection (LR) for patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> compared with open resection (OR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of a prospective database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a minimum follow-up of 12 months after LR or OR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> analyses were performed on an "intention-to-treat" basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 162 consecutive patients submitted to LR and 127 submitted to OR were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the LR group, conversion rate was 26.5 %, mostly due to locally advanced disease (88.4 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A greater risk of conversion was observed among patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size greater than 5 cm regardless the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative outcome was significantly better for LR group, with a shorter hospital stay (P = 0.008), earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of adjuvant treatment, and similar postoperative complications (P = 0.853) and mortality rates (P = 0.958) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> was associated with a higher morbidity compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (P = 0.058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up time of 72 months, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups (P = 0.622) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LR for symptomatic metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is safe and, compared with OR, is associated with a shorter hospital stay and with similar survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concerns remain about LR of bulky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> due to the increased risk of conversion and postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
