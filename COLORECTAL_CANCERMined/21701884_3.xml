<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Information on the KRAS status of the patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is thus key for clinical practice; however, there is little guidance or definition on which KRAS mutations to assess and how to assess them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To ensure the consistency and the quality of KRAS test results in Europe, an interlaboratory control network needs to be set up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pilot study aimed to identify the variables that need to be assessed in a quality control scheme and to provide a first assessment in a selected set of laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cases were circulated between 13 laboratories by a central laboratory acting as the referent for the mutation status determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study illustrated that of 13 experienced laboratories that perform KRAS testing only ten correctly identified the KRAS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 cases that were circulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no harmonization in DNA isolation and KRAS mutation detection method between the laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that future standardization is needed in KRAS mutation detection methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An expansion of the European Society of Pathology KRAS program could identify areas of difficulty in KRAS testing and provide the basis for harmonization </plain></SENT>
