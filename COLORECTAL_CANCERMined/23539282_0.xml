<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) denied coverage for screening computed tomography colonography (CTC) in March 2009, little is understood about whether CTC was targeted to the appropriate patient population prior to this decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Evaluate patient characteristics and known relative clinical indications for screening CTC among patients who received CTC compared to optical colonoscopy (OC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10,538 asymptomatic Medicare beneficiaries who underwent CTC between January 2007 and December 2008, compared to a cohort of 160,113 asymptomatic beneficiaries who underwent OC, matched on county of residence and year of examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN MEASURES: Patient characteristics and known relative appropriate and inappropriate clinical indications for screening CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: CTC utilization was higher among women, patients &gt; 65 years of age, white patients, and those with household income &gt; 75 % (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with relatively appropriate clinical indications for screening CTC were more likely to undergo CTC than OC including presumed incomplete OC (OR 80.7, 95 % CI 76.01-85.63); sedation risk (OR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.05-1.17); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> anticoagulation risk (OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.38-1.54), after adjusting for patient characteristics and known clinical indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, patients undergoing high-risk screening, an inappropriate indication, were less likely to receive CTC (OR 0.4, 95 % CI 0.37-0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 83 % of asymptomatic patients referred to CTC had at least one clinical indication relatively appropriate for CTC (8,772/10,538) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During the 2 years preceding CMS denial for screening, CTC was targeted to asymptomatic patients with relatively appropriate clinical indications for CTC/not receiving OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, CTC utilization was lower among certain demographic groups, including minority patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings raise the possibility that future coverage of screening CTC might exacerbate disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening while increasing overall screening rates </plain></SENT>
