<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Disparities in treatment and mortality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) may reflect differences in access to specialized care or other characteristics of the area where an individual lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program-Medicare data for seniors diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were linked to area measures of the sociodemographic characteristics and the capacity of surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included receipt of stage-appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> care and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment, blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to undergo surgery (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-0.63 and OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.95, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals who lived in areas with the highest tertile of surgeon capacity were more likely to undergo resection than those in the lowest, and use of surgery declined as the percentage of blacks in the area increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for the area measures resulted in a modest decline in disparities in care relative to whites (5.3% for black) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blacks also experienced greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific mortality than whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for area sociodemographics and surgeon capacity reduced the disparity in mortality between blacks and whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there was a similar black/white disparity in the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, the disparity remained after adjustment for area characteristics, although use of chemotherapy was greater in areas with the greatest capacity of medical oncologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic characteristics and measures of the availability of specialized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> providers in the area in which an individual resides modestly mediated disparities in the receipt of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> care and mortality, suggesting that other factors may also be important </plain></SENT>
