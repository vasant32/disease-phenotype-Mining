<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, there was a consistent trend of poorer survival rates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients of earlier relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate novel predictors of early relapse in stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and further to determine their correlation with disease outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinicopathological features and VEGF expression by immunohistochemical staining in 100 stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients undergoing curative resection to identify predictors of postoperative early relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 100 patients, 40 patients were classified into early relapse group, and 60 patients were categorized into non-early relapse group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that vascular invasion (P = 0.048), perineural invasion (P = 0.042), VEGF overexpression (P = 0.023), and high postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (P = 0.004) were independent predictors of early relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found that with more predictors such as the combined incidence of vascular invasion, perineural invasion, VEGF overexpression, and postoperative CEA levels are involved, the incidence of early postoperative relapse increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, VEGF overexpression predicted not only early postoperative relapse but also disease-free survival (P &lt; 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that VEGF overexpression is an important predictor of early postoperative relapse in patients with stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and may help identify patients who would benefit from intensive follow-up and therapeutic programs </plain></SENT>
