<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major components of this seaweed are shown to benefit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and considered to reduce the risks of infarction and ischemic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the intake of dietary fiber of seaweeds is considered to prevent the production and proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The direct effect of an <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> extract prepared from Undaria pinnatifida sporophyll (mekabu) on HCT116 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells was examined, and the mekabu extract was shown to induce the non-oxidative apoptotic damage to the cells, thus resulting in the reduction of their viabilities in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the cytotoxic effects of carcinostatic drugs, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and irinotecan (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11), were observed only in the medium containing sera, while the mekabu extract could effectively reduce the cell viabilities even in the serum-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the mekabu extract may contain a potential active substance inducing the non-oxidative apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> probably through a mechanism different from those of 5-FU and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11, and hence mekabu is possibly useful as an auxiliary drug to the chemotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
