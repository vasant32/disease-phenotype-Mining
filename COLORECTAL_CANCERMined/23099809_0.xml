<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Protein expression of nuclear cyclin D1a and D1b was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 335 CRC patients treated with surgery alone or with adjuvant therapy using 5-FU/LEV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic and predictive value of these two molecular markers and clinicopathological factors were evaluated statistically in univariate and multivariate survival analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither cyclin D1a nor D1b showed any prognostic value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An interaction between treatment group and cyclin D1a could be shown for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (P=0.004) and CSS (P=0.025) in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study identifies high cyclin D1a protein expression as a positive predictive factor for the benefit of adjuvant 5-FU/LEV treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, particularly in stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
