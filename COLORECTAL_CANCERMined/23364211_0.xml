<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from a postal survey of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors (6 to 30 months after diagnosis; n = 159), taken from March 2010 to January 2011, were combined with population-level survival estimates and national wage data to calculate temporary and permanent disability, and premature mortality, costs using the human capital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Almost 40% of respondents left the workforce permanently after diagnosis and 90% took temporary time off work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total costs of lost productivity per person were 205,847 in 2008 assuming retirement at the age of 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the retirement age was raised to 70, productivity costs increased by almost a half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the considerable productivity costs associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and highlighted the effect of rising retirement ages on costs </plain></SENT>
