<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who died under surgical care in Scotland from 1996-2005 underwent peer review audit using established methodologies through the Scottish Audit of Surgical Mortality (SASM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 10 year study period,3029 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, mean age 76(13-105) yearsdied under surgical care of whom 80% had presented as an emergency admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operative intervention was performed in 1557 (51%) of whom1030(34%) patients had a resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The annual number of patients dying after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> resection decreased significantly (P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant decreases in adverse events were noted over time with a 67% fall in adverse events relating to critical care (P=0.009), a 37% fall for surgical care (P=0.04) and a significant increase in consultant anaesthetist and consultant surgeon input, but there was a 9% increase in delay as an adverse event (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The documented anastomotic leakage rate in patients who died increased from 8% in 1996 to 19% in 2005 (P=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The number of patients dying with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after surgery has decreased in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events in these patients have significantly reduced over a decade with increased consultant involvement although there is the potential for further improvement. © 2013 The Authors </plain></SENT>
