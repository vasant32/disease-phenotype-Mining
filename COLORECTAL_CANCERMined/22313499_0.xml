<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several risk factors increase VTE after RP: advanced age, comorbidities such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopulmonary disease</z:e>, rheumatologic diseases, prior history of VTE, more advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, and simultaneous pelvic lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, the effect of annual surgical caseload (ASC), an established determinant of various RP outcomes, has not been tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A previous study showed in adjusted analyses that patients operated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by very high ASC surgeons were 60% less likely to suffer a VTE than those operated by low ASC surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some authors hypothesized that laparoscopy may contribute to a higher risk of VTE, due to peritoneal insufflation, reverse Trendelenburg position and prolonged operative time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The VTE rates reported in the current population-based study closely reflect those reported in institutional series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we validated the practice-makes-perfect concept, since ASC was linked to VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could not detect statistically significantly differences between minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) patients and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that lower rates of VTE should be expected in patients treated by high ASC surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that VTE-specific processes of care need to be improved, with the intent of reaching the level recorded in patients treated by high ASC surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, MIRP seems to be no risk factor for VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of annual surgical caseload (ASC) on the likelihood of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) after radical prostatectomy (RP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2008, 36 699 RPs were performed in the state of Florida </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models predicting the likelihood of VTE were fitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Covariates included year of surgery, age, race, baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), lymph node dissection, ASC and surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall VTE rate was 0.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It was higher in patients operated within the low (0.4%) and intermediate (0.3%) ASC tertile than in those operated within the high-ASC tertile (0.1%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 6.0% in patients with VTE vs 0.1% in others (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Median length of stay and median total hospital charges were 9 vs 3 days (P &lt; 0.001) and $51 571 vs $24 943 (P &lt; 0.001) in patients with VTE vs others, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses predicting VTE, patients operated on by low-ASC surgeons were at higher risk of VTE than those operated on by high-ASC surgeons (odds ratio [OR] = 3.78, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Additionally, black patients were more likely to experience a VTE (OR = 1.80, P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Patients with CCI â‰¥ 1 were also more likely to experience a VTE than others (OR = 1.65, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Conversely, patients who had undergone minimally invasive radical prostatectomy were not more likely to experience a VTE than those who had undergone open RP (OR = 1.97, P = 0.086) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RP by high-ASC surgeons exerts a protective effect on the likelihood of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Additionally, VTE is associated with higher mortality, prolonged length of stay and increased hospital charges </plain></SENT>
