<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODSAfter resection of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> synchronous nonresectable liver-limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (FOLFIRI [fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan] or mFOLFOX6 [modified fluorouracil, leucovorin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>]) plus cetuximab (arm A) or chemotherapy alone (arm B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the rate of patients converted to resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response and survival.ResultsThe intent-to-treat population comprised 138 patients; 70 patients were randomly assigned to arm A and 68 to arm B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a median of 25.0 months of follow-up, the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate and median survival time (MST) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were 30% and 24.4 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The R0 resection rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were 25.7% (18 of 70 patients) in arm A and 7.4% (five of 68 patients) in arm B, which were significantly different (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in arm A had improved objective response rates (57.1% v 29.4%; P &lt; .01), increased 3-year OS rate (41% v 18%; P = .013) and prolonged MST (30.9 v 21.0 months; P = .013) compared with those in arm B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, in arm A, patients who had resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> had a significantly improved MST (46.4 v 25.7 months; P &lt; .01) compared with those who did not undergo surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONFor patients with initially unresectable KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CLMs, cetuximab combined with chemotherapy improved the resectability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and improved response rates and survival compared with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
