<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The VEGF-A splice form, VEGF(165)b, anti-angiogenic in animal models, binds bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) would occur only in patients with low relative VEGF(165)b levels treated with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Blinded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from the phase III trial of FOLFOX4 Â± bevacizumab were assessed for VEGF(165)b and VEGF(total) by immunohistochemistry and scored relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A predictive index (PI) was derived from the ratio of VEGF(165)b:VEGF(total) for 44 samples from patients treated with FOLFOX + bevacizumab (arm A) and 53 samples from patients treated with FOLFOX4 (arm B), and PFS, and overall survival (OS) analyzed on the basis of PI relative to median ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unadjusted analysis of PFS showed significantly better outcome for individuals with VEGF(165)b:VEGF(total) ratio scores below median treated with FOLFOX4 + bevacizumab compared with FOLFOX4 alone (median, 8.0 vs. 5.2 months; P &lt; 0.02), but no effect of bevacizumab on PFS in patients with VEGF(165)b:VEGF(total) ratio &gt;median (5.9 vs. 6.3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings held after adjustment for other clinical and demographic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OS was increased in arm A (median, 13.6 months) compared with arm B (10.6 months) in the low VEGF(165)b group, but this did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the high VEGF(165)b:VEGF(total) group between FOLFOX + bevacizumab (10.8 months) and FOLFOX alone (11.3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low VEGF(165)b:VEGF(total) ratio may be a predictive marker for bevacizumab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, and individuals with high relative levels may not benefit </plain></SENT>
