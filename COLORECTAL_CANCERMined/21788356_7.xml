<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In a recent randomized phase III clinical trial in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, the addition of the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (mAb) cetuximab to bevacizumab and chemotherapy resulted in decreased progression-free survival, in particular for patients with the high-affinity FcγRIIIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The presence of natural killer (NK) cells and type 2 (M2) macrophages in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was determined by immunohistochemistry, using antibodies to lineage-specific markers NKp46 and CD68 with CD163, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Influence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bound cetuximab on M2 macrophages was carried out in vitro with EGFR-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and short-term differentiated monocytes from blood donors, who were typed for the FcγRIIIA polymorphism (CD16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by NK cells is generally proposed as one of the antitumor mechanisms of mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that CD163-positive M2 macrophages are much more abundant in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro analysis of M2 macrophages revealed high levels of Fc-gamma receptors (FcγR) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-L1 and production of IL-10 and VEGF but not IL-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These anti-inflammatory and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-promoting mediators were released upon coculture with EGFR-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells loaded with low concentrations of cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Macrophage activation depended on EGFR expression on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, FcγRs, target specificity of the mAb and mobility of antibody complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab-induced macrophage responses were more pronounced for FCGR3A 158<z:chebi fb="3" ids="30015">-Val </z:chebi>(high-affinity) carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-promoting M2 macrophages are activated by the therapeutic mAb cetuximab in the local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment and argue that this immune mechanism should be taken into account for the application of therapeutic antibodies </plain></SENT>
