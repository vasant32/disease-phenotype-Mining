<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> undergoing elective laparoscopic radical surgery were randomized to receive preoperative bowel preparation using oral intestinal antimicrobial agents (n=20) or using oral intestinal probiotics (Jinshuangqi Tablets, 2.0 g, 3 times daily) since the fifth day before the operation and at 24 h after the operation for 7 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon admission and 7 days after the operation, fecal samples and fasting peripheral venous blood were collected from the patients to examine the intestinal flora and serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IgA, IgG, and IgM, NK cell activity, T lymphocytes subsets CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 7 days after the operation, the patients receiving probiotics showed significantly increased counts of intestinal Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus (P&lt;0.05) and significantly lowered counts of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of IL-2, IgA, IgG and IgM as well as CD4(+) cell percentage <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increased significantly in probiotics group compared with those in patients with conventional intestinal preparation (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative application of intestinal probiotics to replace preoperative oral intestinal antimicrobial agents can effectively correct intestinal flora imbalance and improve the immune function of surgical patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
