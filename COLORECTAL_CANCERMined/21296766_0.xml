<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, drug-sensitive HCT8 and multidrug-resistant (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, VCR) HCT8/V <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines were used to examine the role of c-Jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-Terminal Kinase- (JNK) signaling pathway in P-gp-mediated <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> associated with Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, and NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, significantly reduced the degree of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> in HCT8/V cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a significant decrease in gene level of MDR1 and protein level of P-gp in HCT8/V cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, addition of a JNK inhibitor had no significant effect on the expression of COX-2 in both HCT8 and HCT8/V cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, inhibition of COX-2 activity by a chemical inhibitor or its silence by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> significantly decreased the level of phosphorylated c-Jun at Ser63/73 in HCT8/V cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, upregulation of COX-2 significantly increased the levels of P-gp and p-c-Jun at Ser63/73 in HCT8 cells, but not in HCT8/V cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> accumulation in HCT8/V cells significantly increased after inhibiting COX-2 and JNK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our study has provided the first direct evidence that COX-2 contributes to P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance via phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63/73 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
