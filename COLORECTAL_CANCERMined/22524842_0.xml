<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted with 485 cases and 970 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>XRCC1 and XRCC2 genotype polymorphisms were based upon duplex polymerase-chain-reaction with the confronting-two-pairprimer (PCR-CTPP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The XRCC1 399Cln allele polymorphism was found to be associated with an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, while an non-significant inversely association was noted for XRCC3 241Thr/Thr genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found that individuals with the XRCC1 399 Gln and XRCC3 241Met alleles had an elevated risk, while XRCC3241Thr/Thr was proctective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study is the first to provide evidence of importance of XRCC1 and XRCC3 gene polymorphisms for risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
