<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> parameter CD34 microvascular density (MVD) on overall survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were followed-up for 72 months after curative colorectal operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood vessels measurement was done using the CD34-MVD immunochemistry method, and light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MVD was inversely correlated with patients' survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MVD value &lt; 35 proved as independent good prognostic factor, and patients with this value lived during the 72-month follow up after surgery, while a MVD value &gt; 65 was an independent poor prognostic factor and such patients died within 11 months after radical surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to these results, the CD34-MVD seems to be a significant prognosticator of overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
