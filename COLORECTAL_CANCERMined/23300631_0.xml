<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In addition to pathological TNM (pTNM) staging, the macroscopic staging (surgical TNM, sTNM) is another method used to stage and assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and it also potentially influences patient treatment guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, for the same patient, surgeons and pathologists might assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> depth differently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the prognosis of patients who exhibit unconformity of intraoperative and postoperative results and propose a revised pT category (r-pT category) to predict survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In our study, 948 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We proposed a novel r-pT category in which surgical macroscopic T4b (sT4b) is incorporated into the pT category, namely, patients in the pT3 category with sT4b <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> are reclassified as being in the r-pT4a category; patients in the pT4a category with sT4b <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> are reclassified as being in the r-pT4b category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>-specific survival according to the r-pT category was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A two-step multivariate analysis was used to determine correlations between the r-pT category and the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Harrell's C statistic was utilized to test the predictive capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant prognostic differences among the r-pT subcategories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We substituted the r-pT category for the pT category in current TNM staging in a 2-step multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Harrell's C statistical analysis results demonstrated that the r-pT category had superior predictive capacity compared to the pT category (Harrell' C: 0.668 vs. 0.636; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the pT3 category with sT4b <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and patients in the pT4a category with sT4b <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, are potentially under-staged, reclassification into higher categories could potentially benefit these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the r-pT category we proposed is potentially superior to the pT category in the assessment of prognosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
