<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether these associations are genetically based </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the MBL and MASP-2 genotypes are investigated in 593 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 348 healthy controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MBL2 were analysed using TaqMan assays, with characterization of MBL2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> A, variants B, C and D and alleles H/L, Y/X and P/Q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SNP D120G for MASP-2 was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of MBL and MASP-2 were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MBL2 and MASP-2 genotype distribution was similar among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and healthy controls and MBL2 genotype significantly associated with MBL concentration in serum (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant association between MBL2/MASP-2 genotype and post-operative infectious complications (P=0.33 and 0.22), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent cancer</z:e> or survival (P=0.74 and P=0.61 respectively) was found </plain></SENT>
