<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their consumption is associated with health benefits against colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large procyanidins (with more than three subunits) are not absorbed by intestinal epithelial cells but could exert biological actions through their interactions with the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the capacity of hexameric procyanidins (Hex) to prevent oncogenic events initiated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (DCA), a secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> linked to the promotion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hex interacted with Caco-2 cell membranes preferentially at the water-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hex (2.5-20 Î¼M) inhibited DCA-triggered increase in cellular calcium, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activation, and oxidant production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DCA promoted the activation of protein kinase B (Akt), of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and p38, and of the downstream transcription factor AP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This activation was not triggered by calcium or oxidant increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hex caused a dose-dependent inhibition of DCA-mediated activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DCA also triggered alterations in the cell monolayer <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, events that were delayed by Hex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The capacity of large procyanidins to interact with the cell membrane and prevent those cell membrane-associated events can in part explain the beneficial effects of procyanidins on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
