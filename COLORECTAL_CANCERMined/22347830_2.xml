<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent publications have correlated achievement of mucosal healing with good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no validated definition of what constitutes mucosal healing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In clinical trials of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, mucosal healing has been achieved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylates</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, and infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, mucosal healing has been achieved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, infliximab, and adalimumab, and mucosal healing has been maintained with infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Achievement of long-term mucosal healing has been associated with a decreased risk of colectomy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients, a decreased need for cortico-steroid treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients, and a trend toward a decreased need for hospitalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, assessment of mucosal healing requires regular use of endoscopy, which is associated with increased costs, patient discomfort, and side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers such as fecal calprotec-tin, fecal lactoferrin, serum C-reactive protein, and fecal S1 00A1 2 have been shown to correlate with disease activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>; in the future, these biomarkers might be used as surrogate markers for mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Newer clinical trials are incorporating mucosal healing as an endpoint for evaluation of efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, before mucosal healing will be sufficient to guide therapy, clinicians need a standard definition of mucosal healing and a consistently used, prospectively validated scale with good interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
