<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: There have been inconsistent results published about the relationship between excess body weight, expressed as <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased body mass index</z:mp> (BMI), and risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a meta-analysis to explore this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We focused on whether the relationship varied based on the sex of the study subjects, study design, features of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, or potential confounders, including alcohol use, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> use, smoking, and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified studies by performing a literature search of Medline, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science through July 31, 2011, and by searching the reference lists of pertinent articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 36 independent studies, which included 29,860 incident cases of CRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary relative risks with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was assessed using Cochran's Q statistic and I(2) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, a 5-unit increase in BMI (calculated as kg/m(2)) increased the risk for CRA (summary relative risk = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.13-1.26), although there was a high level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among studies (P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) &lt; .001; I(2) = 76.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses revealed that the increased risk of CRA in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals was independent of race, geographic location, study design, sex, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> progression, and confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> and risk for CRA was stronger for colon than rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on a meta-analysis, <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> increases the risk for colon but not rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, there is no sex difference in the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp> and risk of CRA </plain></SENT>
