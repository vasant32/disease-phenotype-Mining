<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28716">Palmitoleic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> were significantly lower in colorectal cancerous tissue, ranging from 20% to 50% less than the adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
