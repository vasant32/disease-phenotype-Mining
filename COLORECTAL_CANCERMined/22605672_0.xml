<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The net economic impact of a colonoscopy patient navigator program was evaluated in an urban public hospital setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefit analyses were performed of a colonoscopy patient navigation program at 3 urban public hospitals in the period from 2003 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Program effectiveness was assessed in a 2-group, pre- and post-program, nonrandomized evaluation, comparing program hospitals with comparison hospitals that served similar populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Costs were assessed from the provider's perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included colonoscopy volume, colonoscopy completion rate, program cost, incremental cost-effectiveness, and net monetary benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient navigation was associated with a 61% increase in average monthly colonoscopy volume at program hospitals, from 114 procedures to 184 procedures, compared with a 12% increase at comparison hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted for other factors, the navigator program increased colonoscopy volume by 44 to 67 additional procedures per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average program cost varied from $50 to $300 per patient referred to a navigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incremental cost-effectiveness varied from $200 to $700 per additional colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 2 hospitals, net revenue associated with increased colonoscopy volume exceeded the program cost per additional colonoscopy, yielding a net financial benefit; at the third hospital, the program yielded a net cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Variation between hospitals in the program's economic impact was primarily attributable to differences in personnel costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Economic evaluation of this colonoscopy patient navigator program in an urban public hospital setting suggests that such programs can be a cost-effective use of limited resources and yield a net financial benefit for providers </plain></SENT>
