<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to describe the disposition and resource use of Ontario's elderly population undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> operations as well as to identify predictors of outcomes using population-based data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 33,238 patients aged 50 years and older with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were identified using International Classification of Diseases 9 and 10 codes in the Ontario <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry linked to procedure codes in the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database representing colorectal operations within 6 months of diagnosis from 1997 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on an individual's home-care use were collected from the Ontario Home Care Administrative System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohort was divided into the following age groups: 50-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-79 years, and 80 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes assessed were postoperative mortality, length of stay, discharge disposition, need for home care, and readmission within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on univariate and multivariate analyses, patients aged 75-79 years and 80 years and older were more likely to die in hospital (odds ratio 2.84; 95% confidence interval 2.32-3.47 and odds ratio 5.72; 95% confidence interval 4.76-6.88), stay longer in hospital (2.78 [standard error 0.22] and 5.16 [standard error 0.19] days, respectively), not return home (odds ratio 5.62; confidence interval 3.99-7.98 and odds ratio 11.59; confidence interval 8.32-16.13), receive home care (odds ratio 1.44; 95% confidence interval 1.34-1.55 and odds ratio 1.71; 95% confidence interval 1.59-1.83), and be readmitted (odds ratio 1.31; 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.45 and odds ratio 1.59; 95% confidence interval 1.44-1.75) compared with younger individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of discharge home for patients aged 80 years and older was more than 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors predisposing patients older than 75 years to poorer outcomes were higher Charlson comorbidity score, urgent admission, construction of a stoma, and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although discharge-related outcomes worsen with age, most elderly patients do well and can return home after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients require more support; therefore, discharge planning should be part of preoperative assessment and discussions </plain></SENT>
