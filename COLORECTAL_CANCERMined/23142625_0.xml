<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 165 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery for colonic and upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, enrolled from October 2008 to October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned randomly to groups that received electroacupuncture (n = 55) or sham acupuncture (n = 55), once daily from postoperative days 1-4, or no acupuncture (n = 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The acupoints Zusanli, Sanyinjiao, Hegu, and Zhigou were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was time to defecation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included postoperative <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> requirement, time to ambulation, and length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who received electroacupuncture had a shorter time to defecation than patients who received no acupuncture (85.9 ± 3 6.1 vs 122.1 ± 53.5 h; P &lt; .001) and length of hospital stay (6.5 ± 2.2 vs 8.5 ± 4.8 days; P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who received electroacupuncture also had a shorter time to defecation than patients who received sham acupuncture (85.9 ± 36.1 vs 107.5 ± 46.2 h; P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electroacupuncture was more effective than no or sham acupuncture in reducing postoperative <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> requirement and time to ambulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multiple linear regression analysis, an absence of complications and electroacupuncture were associated with a shorter duration of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> and hospital stay after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a clinical trial, electroacupuncture reduced the duration of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo>, time to ambulation, and postoperative <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> requirement, compared with no or sham acupuncture, after laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
