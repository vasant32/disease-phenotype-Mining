<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerns and controversies remain over combining cytotoxic chemotherapy with bevacizumab in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified medical records of 99 patients with synchronous metastatic primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who received chemotherapy with bevacizumab as their initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of subsequent use of surgery and surgical outcomes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were also assessed for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who received bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy for synchronous metastatic primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were divided into the non-surgery and surgery groups according to the resection status of their asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the non-surgery group, two patients (4.4%) underwent additional surgery, while three patients (5.7%) required surgery for rectovesical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> in the surgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 17 months for the non-surgery group (95% CI: 10.6-23.3 months) and 23 months for the surgery group (95% CI: 21.3-24.6 months; P = 0.322) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study utilizing chemotherapy with bevacizumab did not result in an increased rate of morbidity related to the unresected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival is not compromised by leaving the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> intact </plain></SENT>
