<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein expression of CD133 was immunohistochemically evaluated in surgical specimens of 225 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who were treated by surgery, as well as those of 78 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between CD133 expression and clinicopathological features, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence and overall survival was analyzed in both populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 225 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> without CRT, 93 (41.3%) were positive for CD133 expression, which was enhanced in cases with advanced T stage and venous invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CD133 was positive in 47 (60.3%) of 78 cases with CRT, which was significantly higher than the CD133-positive rate in non-CRT specimens (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD133 was independently correlated with the histological <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grade (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CD133 is not a distinctive colorectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> marker; expression of CD133 is suggested to be one of the key factors associated with resistance to CRT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
