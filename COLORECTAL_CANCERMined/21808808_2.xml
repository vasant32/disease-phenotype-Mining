<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over 1400 proteins were identified and quantitated, with 118 determined as differentially expressed by &gt;1.3-fold, with false discovery rate &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene Ontology analysis indicated that proteins with increased expression levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> include those associated with glycolysis, calcium binding, and protease inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proteins with reduced levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were associated with loss of ATP production through: (i) reduced Î²-oxidation of fatty acids, (ii) reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> production by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle and (iii) decreased oxidative phosphorylation activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, biosyntheses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> were significantly reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Validation experiments using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed strong concordance with iTRAQ data suggesting that this workflow is suitable for identifying biomarker candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discuss the uses and challenges of this approach to generate biomarker leads for patient prognostication </plain></SENT>
