<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of different KRAS mutations on treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> in SW48 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isogenic SW48 KRAS wt, G12A, G12C, G12D, G12R, G12S, G12 V, and G13D cells were evaluated for ERK phosphorylation with and without EGF stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the respective cell lines were tested for the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> on ERK/ELK phosphorylation, cell cycle, and cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to KRAS wt cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> KRAS mutant variants were associated with resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> chemosensitivity assay, the grade of resistance was less pronounced in G13D and highest in G12A, G12C, and G12S mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction in ERK phosphorylation due to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> was highest in G12V (89 %) mutant cells and lowest in G12A (24 %) mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ELK phosphorylation was less decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> KRAS mutant variants compared to KRAS wt cells following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The grade of resistance appears to correlate with the individual KRAS-dependent intrinsic activation of ERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our isogenic cell culture model suggests that KRAS mutations in SW48 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells are linked to resistance to the multityrosine kinase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KRAS G13D mutant SW48 cells represented the KRAS subspecies with the lowest grade of resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies will have to clarify whether KRAS can be used to guide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> treatment or-in general-a treatment with a multityrosine kinase inhibitor in mCRC </plain></SENT>
