<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate the potential association between NQO1 609C&gt;T polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population comprised 672 histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and 672 frequency-matched control subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic illness</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism-based methods for genotyping analyses and unconditional logistic regression model for statistical evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> increased with the level of smoking and decreased with the consumption of tea, fresh fruits, and vegetables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that the NQO1 609 CT and TT genotypes were associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (CT: adjusted OR=2.02, 95% CI=1.55-2.57; TT: adjusted OR=2.51, 95% CI=1.82-3.47), compared with the CC genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NQO1 609C&gt;T appeared to have a multiplicative joint effect with both tobacco smoking and alcoholic drinking (P for multiplicative interactions were 0.0001 and 0.013, respectively) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the NQO1 609C&gt;T polymorphism plays an important role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the Chinese population, which is strengthened by alcohol drinking or tobacco smoking </plain></SENT>
