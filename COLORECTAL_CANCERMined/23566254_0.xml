<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of mucin expression has been reported in several studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between mucin expression and other previously reported prognostic factors, including infiltration of CD10(+) myeloid cells (iCD10), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) expression, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding at invasion fronts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of 206 colorectal samples was performed to determine whether MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, and MUC5AC expression could predict the survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial sections were stained for CD10, TGF-β1, and pan-cytokeratin in order to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As per multivariate analyses, MUC1 expression appeared to be the most significant predictor of both recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, MUC4 was only significant to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and MUC5AC could be a good marker in stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> which required additional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MUC1 (CD227) expression was associated with iCD10, TGF-β1 expression, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that MUC1 is indicative of poor prognoses that may be associated with immunosuppression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MUC1 expression appears to be a chemoattractant for CD10(+) stromal cells </plain></SENT>
