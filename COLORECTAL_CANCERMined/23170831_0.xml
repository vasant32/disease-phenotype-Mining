<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have proved that persistent and disregulated host/microbial interactions are required for the development of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well known that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IBD is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by 0.5-1% annually, 8-10 years after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To detect the tiny <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IBD patients, a tremendous amount of effort is currently directed for improving colonoscopic technology and noninvasive serological marker development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there is only a limited amount of data available to understand the exact mechanism of how long term <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> is connected to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, our group has identified that significantly increased expression of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) molecule in non-dysplastic mucosa from patients with IBD and remote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, compared to patients with IBD without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CHI3L1 seems to contribute to the proliferation, migration, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of colonic epithelial cells (CECs) under inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the CHI3L1-mediated intracellular signaling cascade is likely to interact with TLR4 signaling in CECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this review article, we have concisely summarized the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlining the development of IBD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, with particular focus on the CHI3L1- and TLR4-signaling pathways in CECs </plain></SENT>
