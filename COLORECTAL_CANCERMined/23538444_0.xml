<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Netrin (Ntn) has the potential to be successfully applied as an anti-apoptotic agent with a high affinity for tissue, for therapeutic strategies of umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-MSC), although the mechanism by which Ntn-1 protects hypoxic injury has yet to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present study examined the effect of Ntn-1 on <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced UCB-MSC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as well as the potential underlying mechanisms of its protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> (72 h) reduced cell viability (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> reduction, and [(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation) and cell number, and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (annexin and/or PI positive), which were reversed by Ntn-1 (10 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Ntn-1 decreased the increase of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and -3, but blocked the decrease of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-reduced Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, in order to examine the Ntn-1-related signaling cascade in the protection of hypoxic injury, we analyzed six Ntn receptors in UCB-MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) and integrin (IN) α6β4, except uncoordinated family member (UNC) 5A-C, and neogenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, IN α6β4 only was detected in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> raft fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, Ntn-1 induced the dissociation of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and APPL-1 complex, thereby stimulating the formation of APPL-1 and Akt2 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ntn-1 also reversed the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced decrease of Akt and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation, which is involved in heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ntn-1-induced phospho-Akt and -GSK-3β were inhibited by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> function-blocking antibody, IN a6b4 function-blocking antibody, and the Akt inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> and/or Ntn-1 stimulated heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>)27 expression, which was blocked by HSF-1-specific small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HSP27-specific siRNA reversed the Ntn-1-induced increase of phospho-Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, HSP27-specific siRNA attenuated the Ntn-1-reduced loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane injury via the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c) release and formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c and HSP27 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the inhibition of each signaling protein attenuated Ntn-1-induced blockage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Ntn-1-induced HSP27 protected hypoxic injury-related UCB-MSC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>- and IN α6β4-dependent Akt, GSK-3β, and HSF-1 signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
