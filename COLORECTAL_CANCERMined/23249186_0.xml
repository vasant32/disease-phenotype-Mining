<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An n-6 essential fatty acid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (ARA) is converted into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi>, which is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether dietary ARA intake leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We thus systematically evaluated available observational studies on the relationship between ARA exposure and the risk of colorectal, skin, breast, prostate, lung, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for articles published up to May 17, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>126 potentially relevant articles from the initial search and 49,670 bibliographies were scrutinised to identify eligible publications by using predefined inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive literature search yielded 52 eligible articles, and their reporting quality and methodological quality was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Information on the strength of the association between ARA exposure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, the dose-response relationship, and methodological limitations was collected and evaluated with respect to consistency and study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For colorectal, skin, breast, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, 17, 3, 18, and 16 studies, respectively, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We could not obtain eligible reports for lung and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies used cohort (n = 4), nested case-control (n = 12), case-control (n = 26), and cross-sectional (n = 12) designs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of subjects (n = 15 - 88,795), ARA exposure assessment method (dietary intake or biomarker), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis and patient recruitment procedure (histological diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries, or self-reported information) varied among studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relationship between ARA exposure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was inconsistent based on ARA exposure assessment methodology (dietary intake or biomarker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there was no strong positive association or dose-response relationship for breast or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were limited numbers of studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e> to draw any conclusions from the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The available epidemiologic evidence is weak because of the limited number of studies and their methodological limitations, but nonetheless, the results suggest that ARA exposure is not associated with increased breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further evidence from well-designed observational studies is required to confirm or refute the association between ARA exposure and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
