<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patient nonadherence to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> therapy is a well-recognized barrier to effective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to identify patients who may need additional support to become adherent, it is important to have a useful tool that takes into account <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the parameters of adherence to prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate adherence of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic agents</z:chebi> and to investigate two calculation methods of adherence score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen were treated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and 15 patients by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50790">aromatase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adherence was measured using a medication event monitoring system and adherence score was calculated by a usual method and a composite adherence score that takes into account missed doses and also intake interval errors (between 2 doses and between meals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Across the 6-month evaluation period, average adherence was 95% with the standard calculation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> group: 89%; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50790">aromatase inhibitor</z:chebi> group: 99%) versus 83% with the composite index (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> group: 62%; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50790">aromatase inhibitor</z:chebi> group: 99%) (p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The composite calculation permits to highlight more nonadherent patients (29.6 vs. 7.4%), particularly in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> group (73 vs. 18%, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report 2 cases identified as nonadherent with composite adherence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The composite adherence score permits to better evaluate adherence to prescription and to identify barriers to adherence and persistence </plain></SENT>
