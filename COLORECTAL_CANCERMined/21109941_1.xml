<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to compare RUNX3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels and DNA copy numbers in the non-neoplastic rectal mucosa between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients with and without UC-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (UC-Ca) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further aimed to build a predictive model of the development of UC-Ca based on the RUNX3 DNA copy number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RUNX3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels were quantified by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hypermethylation and DNA copy number of RUNX3 were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five UC patients were examined, 17 of whom had UC-Ca (UC-Ca group) and 18 who did not (UC-NonCa group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The UC-Ca group had significantly lower mRUNX3 expression levels and smaller DNA copy numbers than the UC-NonCa group (p=0.04, p=0.0016, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RUNX3 expression levels correlated with DNA copy numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Classification of the UC-Ca and UC-NonCa group based on DNA copy number gave an accuracy of 82.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RUNX3 expression levels in the non-neoplastic rectal mucosa was significantly decreased in the UC-Ca group and it is suggested that this was attributable to the decrease in RUNX3 DNA copy number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present predictive model may be useful in the selection of high risk UC-Ca patients and to improve the efficacy of surveillance colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that RUNX3 might play an important role in the development of UC-Ca </plain></SENT>
