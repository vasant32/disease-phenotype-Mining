<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-to-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> transformation cycle averaging 7-10 years, present guidelines recommend repeat colonoscopy within 10 years after negative screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> follow this decade-long progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the incidence and pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> following a previous negative screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of patients who underwent a colectomy at our institution, from 1998 to 2009, were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,784 patient records were screened using exclusion criteria for inclusion in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided as follows: Group 1 included patients with a negative colonoscopy within the previous 5 years; Group 2 included patients without a previous colonoscopy or with a previous colonoscopy more than 5 years prior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 1 patients were evaluated by colonoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e>, signs of obstruction, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, operation performed, and pathology findings were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Ï‡(2) test and paired t test were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 233 patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Group 1 contained 43 patients with a mean age of 73 years (range = 35-94, median = 75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Group 2 had 190 patients with a mean age of 68 years (range = 19-91, median = 70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 18 male and 25 female patients, and Group 2 included 94 male and 96 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both groups were further classified into the following age categories: &lt;50 years, 50-80 years, and &gt;80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eighteen percent of the total study population had newly discovered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> within a 5-year colonoscopy screening period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the distribution of the T and N stages between the two groups and no statistically significant differences when the rate of lymphovascular invasion (19 vs. 17 %; p = 0.39) and perineural invasion (7 vs. 11 %; p = 0.58) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within 5 years, 18 % of our study population developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Most of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were found within the 50-80-year age group and located predominantly in the right colon and distally in the sigmoid and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>While distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> may be visualized by flexible sigmoidoscopy, those located more proximally may be missed, necessitating the need for a full colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although staging was similar between the two groups, Group 1 tumors were less aggressive despite having appeared within 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>As a result of our incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> within a 5-year interval, a shorter period for routine colonoscopy may be considered </plain></SENT>
