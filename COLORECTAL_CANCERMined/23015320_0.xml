<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of well-done meat intake and meat-derived <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> heterocyclic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>) exposure in the risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> has been suggested but not yet established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: With the use of gene-environment interaction analyses, we sought to clarify the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> exposure with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In a case-control study including 2057 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> patients and 3329 controls, we evaluated 16 functional genetic variants to construct an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>-metabolizing score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To derive dietary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>-exposure amount, data were collected regarding dietary intake of meat by cooking method and degree of doneness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 2-fold elevated risk associated with high red meat intake was found for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in subjects with a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>-metabolizing risk score, whereas the risk was 1.3- to 1.4-fold among those with a low risk score (P-interaction â‰¤ 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interaction was stronger for the risk of advanced or multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, in which an OR of 2.8 (95% CI: 1.8, 4.6) was observed for those with both a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>-risk score and high red meat intake (P-interaction = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant interaction was found in analyses that used specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> exposure derived from dietary data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High red meat intake is associated with an elevated risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and this association may be synergistically modified by genetic factors involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> metabolism </plain></SENT>
