<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The multitargeted kinase inhibitor, regorafenib, was combined with chemotherapy as first- or second-line treatment of mCRC to assess safety and pharmacokinetics (primary objectives) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response (secondary objective).Patients and methodsForty-five patients were treated every 2 weeks with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> 400 mg/m(2) bolus then 2400 mg/m(2) over 46 h, folinic acid 400 mg/m(2), and either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 85 mg/m(2) or irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On days 4-10, patients received regorafenib 160 mg orally once daily.ResultsThe median duration of treatment was 108 (range 2-345 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was stopped for adverse events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (17 patients), disease progression (11 patients), and consent withdrawal or investigator decision (11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients remained on regorafenib at data cutoff (two without chemotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drug-related adverse events occurred in 44 patients [grade â‰¥3 in 32 patients: mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (17 patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, hand-foot skin reaction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002148'>hypophosphatemia</z:hpo> (four patients each)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients achieved disease control (partial response or stable disease) for a median of 126 (range 42-281 days).ConclusionRegorafenib had acceptable tolerability in combination with chemotherapy, with increased exposure of irinotecan and SN-38 but no significant effect on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
