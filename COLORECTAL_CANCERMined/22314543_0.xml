<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multilevel Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk and community deprivation level based on data from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry of Bavaria (2003–2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The communities (n=1,408) were classified according to the Bavarian Index of Multiple Deprivation (BIMD), differentiated into quintiles ranging from lowest to highest deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> risk in men and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in both genders were associated with increasing BIMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing the most deprived with the least deprived communities, the relative risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> incidence in men was 1.39 (95% CI 1.29–1.49), for mortality risk 1.54 (95% CI 1.41–1.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence in men was 1.30 (95% CI 1.22–1.38) and in women 1.19 (95% CI 1.11–1.27); for mortality risk we found 1.57 (95% CI 1.40–1.76) in men and 1.34 (95% CI 1.19–1.51) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Area-based deprivation is significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in Bavaria </plain></SENT>
