<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relationship of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) pathway, such as PI3K, K-ras, and B-raf, with response to EGFR-targeted antibodies is less well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> with cetuximab in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Thirty-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomized to receive cetuximab with or without oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received cetuximab i.v. weekly for four weeks and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> twice daily on days 1-28, with recycling every four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the response rate (partial and complete), while the secondary end points were the adverse effects, time to progression and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: was made using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions, using SPSS 10.0, with estimation of both time to progression and overall survival time by the Kaplan-Meier method and comparing the two groups with the use of a log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Partial response was higher in cetuximab-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> (EN), which constituted 33.3% compared to 17.6% in the cetuximab group (P = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival had a statistically higher significant difference in wild K-ras compared to mutant K-ras cases (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was seven and five months in the (EN) and (E) groups respectively (P = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: K-ras and B-raf was a predictor of response, so genotyping of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was needed for defining the patient population that was likely to benefit from the targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A combination of therapy that simultaneously targets K-ras and B-raf could be a useful approach to increase the number of patients who may benefit from anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
