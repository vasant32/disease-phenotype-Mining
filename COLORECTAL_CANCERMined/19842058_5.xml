<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to use comparative proteomics technology to find the differentially expressed proteins between human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-adjacent colorectal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used the highly sensitive two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for the identification of proteins differentially expressed in tumoral and neighboring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have detected differences in abundance of 42 proteins with statistical variance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spot volume ratio within the 95th confidence level (Student's t-test; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>10 out of 42 analyzed proteins were unambiguously identified by MS coupled with database interrogation as being differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 newly implicated proteins, HSP27 was chosen for detailed analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies demonstrated that the differentially expressed proteins found by 2-DE could be confirmed and validated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyses in those few cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that HSP27 might be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring in the therapy of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
