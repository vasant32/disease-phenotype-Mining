<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In most families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial cancers</z:e>, mutations have not been demonstrated; thus, healthy individuals cannot be tested for mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, many persons at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial cancer</z:e> live with an unknown, but presumably high, risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to describe individuals' perceptions of living with an increased risk of colorectal and gynaecologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> where the gene mutation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 30 individuals with familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These persons have no known mutation and therefore should be considered presumptive carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In connection with the interviews, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were offered to take part in a surveillance programme consisting of a colonoscopy and gynaecological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interview transcriptions were analysed by the use of qualitative content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two themes emerged from the analyses: first, living under a threat with two subthemes, threat awareness and distancing oneself from the threat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second theme, living with uncertainty, was divided into four subthemes: influencing one's family, being on the safe side, facing emotions evoked by examinations and trust and disappointment to the medical services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These persons live with a lifelong uncertainty with a varying intensity depending on what happens throughout the life trajectory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They have no diagnosis or patient group to relate to; therefore, the entire situation is often perceived as abstract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, providing information and counselling needs to be more deeply elucidated, and we need to address both situational and existential ways of uncertainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This will, however, require professionals of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disciplines to understand the meaning of uncertainty and help ensure that its adverse effects are decreased with adequate nursing interventions </plain></SENT>
