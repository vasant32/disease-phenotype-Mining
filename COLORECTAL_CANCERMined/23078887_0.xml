<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> have a high prevalence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> among individuals at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 3144 asymptomatic, average-risk individuals without history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> who received a screening colonoscopy examination from January to December 2010 at Konkuk University Medical Center in Seoul, Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were classified as having low (&lt;10%), intermediate (10%-20%), or high (≥20%) risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in the next 10 years, which was based on Framingham/Adult Treatment Panel III risk scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in subjects with low, intermediate, and high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was 25.6% (635/2485), 46.6% (252/541), and 53.4% (63/118), respectively (P &lt; .001); the prevalence of advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was 4.9% (122/2485), 9.2% (50/541), and 17.8% (21/118), respectively, for these subjects (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, the high-risk group had a significantly increased risk of advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-5.65), compared with the low-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The numbers of colonoscopies needed to identify individuals with advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in intermediate-risk and high-risk groups were 10.8 (95% CI, 8.6-14.7) and 5.6 (95% CI, 7.6-11.9), respectively, which were significantly lower than for the low-risk group (20.4; 95% CI, 17.4-24.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and the risk of overall and advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> increase with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals with a 10-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> ≥10% might benefit from colonoscopy screening, but further studies are needed to confirm and generalize these results </plain></SENT>
