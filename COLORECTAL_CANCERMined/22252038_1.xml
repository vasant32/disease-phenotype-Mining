<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Sentinel lymph node (SN) mapping for staging in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains controversial and needs to be validated before it can be implemented in daily practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively assessed the effect of SN mapping on nodal staging and its implication on survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between November 2005 and July 2009, 331 patients underwent a resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 189 patients (group A) an ex-vivo SN procedure was performed with immunohistochemical analysis of the SN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> cell deposits between 0.2 mm and 2.0 mm were referred to as micrometastases (pN1mi+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients (n = 142, group B) had standard nodal staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors for disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average number of harvested lymph nodes was higher in group A than in group B (15.5 ± 7.3 vs 12.1 ± 5.2, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After conventional staging, 81 (43%) patients of group A were judged to have nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This increased to 89 (47%) patients when immunohistochemically detected micrometastases were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group B, 50 (35%) patients had nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow up, a lower recurrence rate was seen in N0 patients after SN mapping compared with the conventional staging group (4%vs 15.2%, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The SN procedure (hazard ratio = 4.1) was an independent predictor of disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The SN procedure results in a more accurate staging of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is reflected by a better prognosis of N0 patients after SN mapping </plain></SENT>
