<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The uptake and long-term cross-presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> Ag long <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (LP) by dendritic cells (DC) make them attractive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vaccine candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains to be established whether LP can prime long-lived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-reactive CTL and whether other cell types are able to cross-present them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using HLA-A2 healthy donor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> patient-derived PBMC, we studied the in vitro cross-priming potential of Melan-A 16-40 LP bearing the HLA-A2-restricted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> 26-35 or its analog 26-35(A27L) and compared it to the priming capacity of the short analog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then addressed LP priming capacity in vivo using HLA-A2 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also studied LP cross-presentation by monocyte-derived DC, plasmacytoid DC, monocytes, and B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed that the modified LP gave rise to high and sustained cross-presentation by monocyte-derived DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This led to cross priming in vitro and in vivo and to expansion of long-lived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-reactive cytotoxic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the LP containing the natural 26-35 epitope primed specific T cells poorly, despite its long-lived cross-presentation, and T cells primed against the short analog were short-lived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further showed that LP cross-presentation is restricted to monocytes and conventional DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results document for the first time, to our knowledge, the strong immunogenicity of a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> Ag LP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of note, they underscore that this property is critically dependent on sufficient HLA binding affinity and/or TCR ligand potency of the cross-presented <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that LP fulfilling this requirement should be used as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vaccines, together with DC maturating agents, especially the Melan-A 16-40(A27L) LP, for the treatment of HLA-A2(+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
