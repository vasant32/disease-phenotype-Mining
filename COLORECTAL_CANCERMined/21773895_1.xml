<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of BV plus FOLFIRI (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin, irinotecan) as second-line treatment in mCRC patients refractory to first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy, and determine potential predictive factors affecting survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four consecutive patients were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received FOLFIRI plus 5 mg/kg BV until progression or unmanageable toxicity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical factors and KRAS status were evaluated as potential biomarkers of efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response was 23.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival (PFS) and time-to-treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) were 248 and 221 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) was 651 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A univariate analysis revealed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thrombin antithrombin complex, alkaline phosphatase, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) levels at baseline were associated with better PFS, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>, and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed that only the CA125 level at baseline was an independent negative predictor of both PFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>KRAS status was not identified as a predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that FOLFIRI plus BV is a viable option in second-line treatment for mCRC refractory to first-line FOLFOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) alone, and indicate that CA125 might be a predictive biomarker for the outcome </plain></SENT>
