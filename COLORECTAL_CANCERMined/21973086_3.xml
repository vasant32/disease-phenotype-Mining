<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to identify new serum biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and we followed a phased biomarker discovery and validation process to obtain an accurate preliminary assessment of potential clinical utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic tumors</z:e> and matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue from 15 CRC patients, using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and identified 17 proteins that had significant differential expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were further confirmed by western blotting for heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) 60, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>, α-enolase, T-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33837">complex protein</z:chebi> 1 subunit β, and leukocyte elastase inhibitor, and by immunohistochemistry for HSP60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using mAbs raised against HSP60, we developed a reliable (precision of 5-15%) and sensitive (0.3 ng·mL(-1)) immunoassay for the detection of HSP60 in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of HSP60 were found in serum from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients in two independent cohorts; the receiver-operating characteristic curve obtained in 112 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 90 healthy controls had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70, which was identical to the AUC of carcinoembryonic antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination of serum markers improved clinical performance: the AUC of a three-marker logistic regression model combining HSP60, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 reached 0.77 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum HSP60 appeared to be more specific for late-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; therefore, future studies should evaluate its utility for determining prognosis or monitoring therapy rather than early detection </plain></SENT>
