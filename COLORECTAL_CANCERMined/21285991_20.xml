<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the clinicopathological features and prognostic impact of KRAS/BRAF mutation in advanced and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with advanced and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated with systemic chemotherapy (n=229) were analysed for KRAS/BRAF genotypes by cycleave PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors associated with survival were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS and BRAF mutations were present in 34.5% and 6.5% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were more likely to develop on the right of the colon, and to be of the poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and peritoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) for BRAF mutation-positive and KRAS 13 mutation-positive patients was 11.0 and 27.7 months, respectively, which was significantly worse than that for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) KRAS and BRAF (40.6 months) (BRAF; HR=4.25, P&lt;0.001, KRAS13; HR=2.03, P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for significant features by multivariate Cox regression analysis, BRAF mutation was associated with poor OS (HR=4.23, P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Presence of mutated BRAF is one of the most powerful prognostic factors for advanced and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The KRAS13 mutation showed a trend towards poor OS in patients with advanced and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
