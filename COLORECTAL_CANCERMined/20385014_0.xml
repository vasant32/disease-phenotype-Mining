<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restrictions in the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire were reported as indicator of anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear yet whether a TCR restriction in peripheral blood mirrors the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the expression of TCR Vbeta-families for the quantification of TCR repertoire alterations in blood and tissue samples from patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples from patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and healthy volunteers and tissue samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative Vbeta-family quantification was performed based on quantitative reverse transcribed PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Standard deviation and average mean of the single families were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two variables describing the degree of Vbeta-repertoire restriction were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight blood samples and 37 tissue samples were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCR repertoire restriction was higher in blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patients than in blood of healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference in the degree of TCR repertoire restriction was found between <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and unaffected colon tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found no corresponding elevated TCR families among the different compartments blood, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissue of the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we observed a repertoire restriction in peripheral blood as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue, repertoire alterations were comparable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, suggesting compartment-specific TCR distribution rather than alterations due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-T-cell interaction questioning the presence of highly restricted clonal T-cell expansions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as they have been described in other, assumingly more immunogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> entities </plain></SENT>
