<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current staging by light microscopy alone is not sufficiently predictive of prognosis and would benefit from additional support from biomarkers in order to stratify patients appropriately for adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified that cathepsin D expression was significantly greater in cells from invasive front (IF) area and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (LM) than those from main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> body (MTB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cathepsin D expression was subsequently examined by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays from 119 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strong expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells at the IF did not correlate significantly with any clinico-pathological parameters examined or patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, cathepsin D expression in cells from the MTB was highly elevated in late stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and showed significant correlation with subsequent distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and shorter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that macrophages surrounding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells stained strongly for cathepsin D but there was no significant correlation found between cathepsin D in macrophages at IF and MTB of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient with the clinic-pathological parameters examined </plain></SENT>
