<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the costs and health effects of interventions to combat breast, cervical, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> in order to guide resource allocation decisions in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two World Health Organization sub-regions of the world: countries in sub-Saharan Africa with very high adult and high child mortality (AfrE); and countries in South East Asia with high adult and high child mortality (SearD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis of prevention and treatment strategies for breast, cervical, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, using mathematical modelling based on a lifetime population model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Demographic and epidemiological data were taken from the WHO mortality and global burden of disease databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimates of intervention coverage, effectiveness, and resource needs were based on clinical trials, treatment guidelines, and expert opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unit costs were taken from the WHO-CHOICE price database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted, expressed in international dollars ($Int) for the year 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both regions certain interventions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> control (screening through cervical smear tests or visual inspection with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> in combination with treatment) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> control (increasing the coverage of treatment interventions) cost &lt;$Int2000 per DALY averted and can be considered highly cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the sub-Saharan African region screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (by colonoscopy at age 50 in combination with treatment) costs $Int2000-6000 per DALY averted and can be considered cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both regions certain interventions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> control (treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stages in combination with mammography screening) cost $Int2000-6000 per DALY averted and can also be considered cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other interventions, such as campaigns to eat more fruit and vegetable or subsidies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> control, are not cost effective according to the criteria defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Highly cost effective interventions to combat cervical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are available in the African and Asian sub-regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> control, these include screening through smear tests or visual inspection in combination with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, increasing treatment coverage is highly cost effective (screening through colonoscopy is cost effective in the African sub-region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> control, mammography screening in combination with treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages is cost effective </plain></SENT>
