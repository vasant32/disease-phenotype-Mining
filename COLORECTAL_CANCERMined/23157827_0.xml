<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples of 221 <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinomas</z:mp> and 131 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell content assessment and macrodissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR-optimized oligonucleotide probe method and Sanger sequencing were performed to detect KRAS gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of KRAS mutation, mutation types, and their concordance were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutation was detected in 6.3% (14/221) and 4.5% (10/221) of 221 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples by using real-time PCR-optimized oligonucleotide probe method and Sanger sequencing, respectively, while in 41.2% (54/131) and 40.5% (53/131) of 131 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between KRAS gene mutations and patients' gender and age (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of KRAS codon 12 mutation was significantly higher than that of KRAS codon 13 mutation (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall concordance between real-time PCR-optimized oligonucleotide probe method and Sanger sequencing for KRAS mutation detection was 97.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Real-time PCR-optimized oligonucleotide probe method provides an alternative method with high consistency and sensitivity as compared to Sanger sequencing in gene mutation detection </plain></SENT>
