<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We attempted to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> by gene expression profiling of frozen esophageal squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> specimens and examined the functional relevance of a newly discovered marker gene, WDR66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Laser capture microdissection technique was applied to collect the cells from well-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> areas in collaboration with an experienced pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole human gene expression profiling of frozen esophageal squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> specimens (n = 10) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous tissue (n = 18) was performed using microarray technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A gene encoding WDR66, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> repeat-containing protein 66 was significantly highly expressed in esophageal squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microarray results were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in a second and independent cohort (n = 71) consisting of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 25), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (n = 11), esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 13), <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 15) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to understand WDR66's functional relevance siRNA-mediated knockdown was performed in a human esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> cell line, KYSE520 and the effects of this treatment were then checked by another microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High WDR66 expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P = 0.031) of patients suffering from esophageal squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that WDR66 expression remained an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WDR66 knockdown by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference resulted particularly in changes of the expression of membrane components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of vimentin was down regulated in WDR66 knockdown cells while that of the tight junction protein occludin was markedly up regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of WDR66 resulted in suppression of cell growth and reduced cell motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: WDR66 might be a useful biomarker for risk stratification of esophageal squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>WDR66 expression is likely to play an important role in esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> growth and invasion as a positive modulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, due to its high expression and possible functional relevance, WDR66 might be a novel drug target for the treatment of squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
