<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: : Prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo>-the failure of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> to resolve within a few days after major abdominal surgery-leads to significant medical consequences for the patient and costs to the hospital system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was to identify independent preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> in a large consecutive series of patients who had undergone resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : Patients were drawn from a hospital registry of 2400 consecutive resections over the period 1995-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four potential predictors of prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> were analyzed by logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> occurred in 14.0% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant independent predictors of prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> were male sex (OR: 1.7, P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (OR: 1.8, P &lt; 0.001), respiratory comorbidity (OR: 1.6, P &lt; 0.001), resection at urgent operation (OR: 2.2, P &lt; 0.001), perioperative transfusion (OR: 1.6, P &lt; 0.010), stoma constructed (OR: 1.4, P &lt; 0.001), and operation lasting â‰¥3 hours (OR: 1.6, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : These features can be used to alert medical and nursing staff to patients likely to experience prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> after bowel resection so that they can be monitored closely in the postoperative period and available treatments targeted toward them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These features may also be useful in the research context to facilitate the more efficient selection of high-risk patients as subjects in clinical trials of prevention or treatment </plain></SENT>
