<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of CXCR4, CCR7 and CXCL12 expression within resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> was performed and correlated with clinicopathological variables, disease-specific survival, recurrence-free survival and patterns of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-five patients who underwent partial hepatectomy with curative intent were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CXCR4 expression (hazard ratio [HR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.4-9.1) and clinical risk score &gt;2 (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.7) were independently associated with disease-specific survival by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year estimated disease-specific survival rates for positive and negative CXCR4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> expression were 44 and 77%, respectively (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CXCR4 expression (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) and clinical risk score &gt;2 (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.4) were independently associated with recurrence-free survival by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The five year estimated recurrence-free survival rates for positive and negative CXCR4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> expression were 20 and 50%, respectively (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither CXCL12 nor CCR7 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> predicted disease-specific survival or recurrence-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients (65%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> after initial hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Negative CXCR4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> expression was associated with favorable recurrence patterns amenable to salvage resection and/or ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Negative CXCR4 expression in resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> is independently associated with improved disease-specific and recurrence-free survival and favorable patterns of recurrence </plain></SENT>
