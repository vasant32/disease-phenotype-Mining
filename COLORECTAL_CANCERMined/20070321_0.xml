<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Analysis of EGFr by IHC was performed in 230 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients using monoclonal anti-EGFr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total and activated EGFr (pY1068) contents were determined in 92 patients and real-time PCR, to determine the level of EGFr <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi>, was carried out in 60 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no association between EGFr IHC groups and the mean total EGFr levels measured using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study shows that the results of different EGFr detection methods do not correlate with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, the real role of EGFr in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains unsettled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the receptor itself does not seem to be important and it would be better to focus on EGFr signalling in downstream pathways </plain></SENT>
