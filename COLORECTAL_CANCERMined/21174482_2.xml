<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Biennial faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) for individuals aged 60-69 years is the primary screening tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in the UK NHS, despite a large number of patients undergoing an unnecessary optical colonoscopy (OC) and evidence from modelling studies to suggest that more cost-effective technologies exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT colonography (CTC) is an emerging <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening technology with the potential to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by detecting pre-cancerous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at an earlier stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to assess the impact of introducing CTC into the UK NHS screening programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> on key health outcomes as well as the NHS budget and healthcare resource capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: a discrete Markov model was used to reflect the natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the impact of three screening scenarios (biennial FOBT with and without CTC triage of patients referred to OC, and CTC every 5 years) on a range of health outcomes, including the incidence and prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, in a hypothetical cohort of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The yearly costs, health outcomes and healthcare resource capacity requirements were estimated over a 10-year period (2009-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: using CTC to follow up FOBT-positive patients (scenario 2) was less costly than directing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FOBT-positive patients to OC (scenario 1); saving £776 283 over 10 years for 100 000 individuals invited for screening (year 2007 values), primarily by avoiding approximately 1700 OCs, but was estimated to require 2200 additional CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Implementing a programme of 5-yearly CTC as a primary screen is expected to be more expensive than FOBT screening over the short term (driven by high screening and diagnosis costs), despite substantial savings in treatment costs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> over the 10-year time horizon of the model and improved health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: adding CTC into the existing NHS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme as part of a preventive screening strategy could be less costly to the NHS over the longer term when used to triage FOBT-positive patients to appropriate follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased demand for radiology services may be compensated for by reduced demand in endoscopy units </plain></SENT>
