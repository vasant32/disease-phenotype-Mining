<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to measure the frequency of circulating CD34-positive endothelial and progenitor cells in the circulation and evaluate their potential values as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood was collected from 45 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free control donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detection and enumeration of cells was carried out by flow cytometry on the basis of immunophenotypes established for the cell populations of interest: hematopoietic and endothelial circulating progenitor cells, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), and CD34bright leukocytes (CD34b LC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Groups were compared using multivariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI), the mean frequencies of MSCs and CD34b LCs were significantly higher in the circulation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The areas under the ROC curve were 0.77 and 0.82 for MSCs and CD34b LCs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of circulating MSCs, but not of the other cell populations, was also found to be significantly higher in the circulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m(2)) than in lean patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased frequency of MSCs and CD34b LCs in the peripheral blood may represent a new diagnostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: BMI-dependent changes in circulating MSCs, potentially mobilized from white adipose tissue may reveal their trafficking to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, which could be one of the mechanistic links between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
