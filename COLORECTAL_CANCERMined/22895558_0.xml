<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: US <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening guidelines for people at average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> endorse multiple screening options and recommend that screening decisions reflect individual patient preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to ascertain decision priorities of people at average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> attending primary care practices in Rochester, New York; Birmingham, Alabama; and Indianapolis, Indiana </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis included 4 decision criteria, 3 subcriteria, and 10 options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four people completed the study; 66% were female, 49% were African American, 9% had low literacy skills, and 27% had low numeracy skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was given the highest priority (mean priority 55%), followed by avoiding screening test side effects (mean priority 17%), minimizing false-positive test results (mean priority 15%), and the combined priority of screening frequency, test preparation, and the test procedure(s) (mean priority 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed 6 distinct priority groupings containing multiple instances of decision priorities that differed from the average value by a factor of 4 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 90% of the study participants fully understood the concepts involved, 79% met AHP analysis quality standards, and 88% were willing to use similar methods to help make important health care decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results highlight the need to facilitate incorporation of patient preferences into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The large number of study participants able and willing to perform the complex AHP analysis used for this study suggests that the AHP is a useful tool for identifying the patient-specific priorities needed to ensure that screening decisions appropriately reflect individual patient preferences </plain></SENT>
