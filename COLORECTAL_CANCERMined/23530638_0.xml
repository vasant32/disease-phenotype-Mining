<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A validated food frequency questionnaire was administered by face-to-face interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2 control groups had closely similar distributions of dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk estimates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> were adjusted ORs (95% CI) of 0.39 (0.23-0.66) and 0.31 (0.18-0.55) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28197">daidzein</z:chebi>, 0.35 (0.20-0.61) and 0.28 (0.16-0.52) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi>, 0.66 (0.41-1.08) and 0.53 (0.32-0.88) for glycitein, and 0.53 (0.33-0.85) and 0.43 (0.26-0.71) for total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavone</z:chebi> using hospital outpatient and population controls respectively </plain></SENT>
