<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The active principle of a gum resin from Boswellia serrata, 3-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-11-keto-Î²-boswellic acid (AKBA), has recently gained attention as a chemopreventive compound due to its ability to target key oncogenic proteins such as 5-lipoxygenase and nuclear factor-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AKBA has been shown to inhibit the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells; however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its anticancer activities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that boswellic acids may achieve their chemopreventive effects by modulating specific microRNA (miRNA) pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that AKBA significantly up-regulated expression of the let-7 and miR-200 families in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both let-7 and miR-200 are putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressive miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AKBA modulated the expression of several downstream targets of the let-7 and miR-200 families, such as CDK6, vimentin and E-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data were further strengthened by miRNA knockdown studies, which revealed that inhibition of let-7i facilitated enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell proliferation, migration and invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, AKBA also induced similar modulation of the let-7 and miR-200 downstream genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> orthotopically implanted in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that AKBA-induced antitumor effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> occur, at least partly through the up-regulation of specific miRNA pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data provide novel evidence that anticancer effects of boswellic acids are due in part to their ability to regulate cellular epigenetic machinery and further highlight the promise for this phytochemical in the preventative and therapeutic applications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
