<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We listed points that citizens, advocacy groups, politicians, health planners, and health professionals should consider when planning, implementing and running population based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The list is general and is applicable to breast, cervical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is based on evidence presented in the three European Union guidelines on quality assurance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening and diagnosis, supplemented with other literature and expert experience presented at a European Science Advisory Network for Health workshop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The implementation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening programme should be divided into the following seven phases: (1) before planning, (2) planning, (3) feasibility testing, (4) piloting or trial implementation, (5) scaling up from pilot to service, (6) running of full-scale programme, and (7) sustainability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each phase, a substantial number of specified conditions have to be met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Successful implementation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening programme requires societal acceptance and local ownership along with the best evidence-based practise and verification of adequate performance in each phase of implementation </plain></SENT>
