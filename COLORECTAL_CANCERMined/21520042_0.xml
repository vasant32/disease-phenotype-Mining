<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, we assessed whether the reported behavior of eating anything at anytime influenced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk and related plasma biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively followed up 55,540 women in the Nurses' Health Study who were aged 48-73 years, had no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and responded to the item "I eat anything I want, anytime I want" in the 1994 questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed blood samples for 1,994 women, which were collected in 1989-1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 12 years of follow-up, 552 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, red and processed meat and other known risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, women who reported eating anything at anytime experienced an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (relative risk = 1.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.56) compared to those who did not report this behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, reporting eating anything at anytime was associated with higher fasting plasma levels of insulin (p = 0.04) and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, reports of eating anything at anytime are associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in this large prospective cohort study, independent of other potential risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
