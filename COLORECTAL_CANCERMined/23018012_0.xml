<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, there has been a change in the paradigm that considered these lesions as the only precursors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and nowadays serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> are also considered to have the potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The studies presented this year at the congress of the American Gastroenterological Association provide important information to improve the characterization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> precursor lesions, especially as regards their detection, prevalence and treatment and surveillance strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notable among these studies were those focussing on evaluating the epidemiological characteristics of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and those attempting to improve the quality of colonoscopy -with the ultimate aim of achieving greater detection of these precursor lesions- by evaluating colon cleansing, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate, withdrawal times, the use of endoscopic caps, narrow band imaging, high-definition endoscopy and, lastly, adequate endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
