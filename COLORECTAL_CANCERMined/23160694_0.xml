<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">Thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase (TYMP) is an angiogenic factor that has potent chemotactic activity for endothelial cells and is involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), previous studies evaluating the relationship between TYMP expression and clinicopathological features have yielded inconsistent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of TYMP, its association with other angiogenic factors, proliferation markers and, to our knowledge, for the first time its relationship with extracellular matrix components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 97 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were immunostained for TYMP, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), microvascular density (CD34), proliferation marker (Ki-67), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p53 oncoprotein and extracellular matrix components (collagen type IV, fibronectin, tenascin and laminin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>) and nucleus (n) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, as well in the stroma (st), endothelium and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High TYMPcyt expression was observed in 7.2% of the cases, moderate in 22.7% and weak in 59.9%, while 10.3% were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High TYMPst expression was observed in 58.8% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TYMPcyt expression was correlated with the VEGF expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and VEGF expression of vessels (p=0.014 and p=0.022, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TYMPst expression was correlated with VEGF expression and tenascin (p=0.014 and p=0.011, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher TYMPcyt expression had a more favorable overall survival (p=0.041) in univariate analysis compared to patients without TYMP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that TYMP plays an important role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, extracellular matrix remodeling and in the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but further studies are needed to clearly define its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
