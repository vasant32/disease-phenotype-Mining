<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the association between the growth factors' expression and lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) with intratumoral and peritumoral difference has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 81 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples were immunohistochemically stained for VEGF-A, VEGF-C and podoplanin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in marginal portion was significantly higher than those in central portion (P = 0.000 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of VEGF-A in marginal portion was correlated with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of VEGF-C in marginal portion was correlated with TNM stage (P = 0.045), peritumoral LVI (P = 0.048) and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group with high VEGF-A expression in marginal portion showed worse survival than the low expression group (P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with high expression of VEGF-C in the marginal portion were not significantly different from those with low VEGF-C expression (P = 0.121) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with high expression of both VEGF-A and VEGF-C in the marginal portion showed the worst survival (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, increased expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in marginal portion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was correlated with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VEGF-C facilitates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells invade into peritumoral lymphatic vessels, and different mechanisms may exist in the invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells into peritumoral and intratumoral lymphatic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Assessment the expression of both VEGF-A and VEGF-C in the marginal portion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> may help to identify patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with unfavourable overall survival </plain></SENT>
