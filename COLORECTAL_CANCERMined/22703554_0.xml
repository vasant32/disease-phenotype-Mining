<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes are frequently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported on a pattern of restricted p53 immunohistochemical overexpression significantly associated with microsatellite instability (MSI), low TP53 mutation frequency, and MDM2 overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether p14ARF alterations could be a mechanism for disabling the p53 pathway in this subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Detailed maps of the alterations in the p14ARF gene were determined in a cohort of 98 CRCs to detect both nucleotide and copy-number changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific PCR combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing was used to evaluate the prevalence and distribution of p14ARF methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p14ARF alterations were then correlated with MSI status, TP53 mutations, and immunohistochemical expression of p53 and MDM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of p14ARF mutations was extremely low (1/98; 1%), whereas coexistence of methylated and unmethylated alleles in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa was common (91/98; 93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only seven of ninety-eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (7%) had a distinct pattern of methylation compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the prevalence and distribution of p14ARF promoter methylation in a region containing 27 CpG sites in 35 patients showed a range of methylated CpG sites in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (0 to 25 (95% CI 1 to 13) versus 0 to 17 (95% CI 0 to 2)) in adjacent colon mucosa (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of the p14ARF promoter was significantly correlated with the restricted p53 overexpression pattern (P = 0.03), and MDM2 overexpression (P = 0.02), independently of MSI phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although no significant correlation between p14ARF methylation and TP53 mutational status was seen (P = 0.23), methylation involving the proximal CpG sites within the 5' CpG flanking exon 1β was present more frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with restricted p53 overexpression than in those with diffuse p53 overexpression (range of methylated clones 17 to 36% (95% CI 24 to 36%) versus range 0 to 3% (95% CI 0 to 3%), P = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: p14ARF epigenetic silencing may represent an important deregulating mechanism of the p53-MDM2-p14ARF pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> exhibiting a restricted p53 overexpression pattern </plain></SENT>
