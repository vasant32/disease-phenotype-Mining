<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The projected median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12 months (81% power, 1-sided level 0.1 log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> dose was 2500 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-7 (n = 11) and was increased to 3000 mg/m(2)/day (n = 29) in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (85 mg/m(2)) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cycles were repeated every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient characteristics included Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) performance status 0 (n = 24) or 1 (n = 15); median age of 62 years (range, 38-81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median cycles administered were 7 (range, 125), corresponding to 3.5 months' treatment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pertinent grade 3/4 toxicities seen were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (18%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e> (10%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in 1 patient (3%) and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (3%) were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response rate (RR) was 38% (1 complete and 14 partial responses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 8.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-10.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 17.2 months (95% CI, 10.4-24.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The first US experience of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> to our knowledge (3000 mg/m(2) on days 1-7) in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>/bevacizumab in mCRC does not appear to have advantages compared with current standard first-line mCRC treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
