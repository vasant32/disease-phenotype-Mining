<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) on the proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> on HT-29 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells were evaluated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (Hoechst33258 dyeing), DNA gel electrophoresis, and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The content of n-6PUFA and n-3PUFA of the treated cells and the ratio of n-6/n-3PUFA were analyzed by chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DHA effectively inhibited HT-29 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proliferative inhibition rates of HT-29 cells treated with 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/L DHA for 24 hours were 16.8%, 24.7%, 50.0%, and 60.1%, respectively, while the inhibition rates were 50.0%, 69.9%, and 77.0% respectively when HT-29 cells were treated with 40 mg/L DHA for 24, 48, and 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The typical apoptotic morphologic changes of HT-29 cells could be observed, including chromatin margination, nuclear condensation and apoptotic bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gel electrophoresis of DNA degradation displayed typical DNA ladder fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HT-29 cells treated with DHA were arrested in G1 phase and the proportion of HT-29 cells in Gl phase increased compared with that of the control group (72.1% vs. 51.3%) while the proportion of the cells in S phase decreased significantly (19.9% vs. 38.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The content of n-6PUFA decreased, n-3PUFA content increased and the ratio of n-6/n-3PUFA lowered significantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells treated with DHA (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: n-3PUFA can inhibit the growth of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells via inhibition of the proliferation and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects may be associated with decrease in n-6/n-3PUFA ratio </plain></SENT>
