<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent phase III trials revealed that new molecular-target agents, regorafenib and aflibercept, are useful for previously treated mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor which targets angiogenic, stromal and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase(RTK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that consists of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)-binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2, fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG1 immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are different in structure, but an anti-angiogenic effect is one of the main mechanisms of action they have in common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the 18147ML study, bevacizumab beyond progression (BBP), anti-angiogenic therapies are important in any line of chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
