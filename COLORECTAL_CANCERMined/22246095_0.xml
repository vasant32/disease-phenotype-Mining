<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its high level positively correlates with clinical stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and is a negative prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests a possible relationship between functional polymorphisms of the MMP-7 gene and susceptibility to development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and an aggressive course of the disease.The aim of the study was to assess the effects of A/G functional polymorphism at -181 site of the MMP-7 gene promoter region on development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>.Material and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 184 patients treated surgically for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at the Department of General and Colorectal Surgery of the Medical University in Łódź in the years 2006-2009 and a control group of 205 cancer-free individuals with a negative family history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> have been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphic variants of the MMP-7 gene promoter region have been analysed using the RFLP-PCR method.Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference in distribution of genotypes has been found between the investigated group and the control group, and the OR analysis confirmed a relationship between the A/G [1.67 (1.03-2.72); p= 0.038] and G/G [2.12 (1.34-3.38); p = 0.018] genotypes and an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of lymph node involvement was more than twice higher for the G/G genotype (OR = 2.83 (1.18-6.79); P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the analysis of genotype distribution in patients divided into groups according to the T parameter of the TNM classification revealed a relationship between the G/G genotype and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No relationship between the investigated A/G polymorphism and the presence of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> has been found.Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Obtained results indicate a possible relationship between -181 A/G polymorphism of the MMP-7 gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of colorectal epithelial cells and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests applicability of this polymorphism as a predisposing factor for the disease and a prognostic factor, which in the future may be useful in the management algorithm for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
