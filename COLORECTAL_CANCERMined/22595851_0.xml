<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alcohol is considered to be a cocarcinogen or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoter, and various studies have shown a linear dose-dependent association between alcohol consumption and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a few studies suggest that moderate alcohol consumption may have a protective effect, similar to that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to quantity and type of alcohol consumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This was case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: The study was conducted in the area of Attica, Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 250 consecutive patients with a first diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were matched for age group and sex with 250 controls recruited from the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 63 (SD, 12) years for the patient group (147 men, 59%; 103 women, 41%) and 55 (SD, 13) years for the control group (112 men; 44.8%; 138 women, 55.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaires were administered by trained interviewers to assess sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle characteristics, in addition to dietary habits and quantity and type of alcoholic beverages usually consumed during the preceding year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated with the MedDietScore (theoretical range, 0-55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With intake of less than 12 g of alcohol per day as the reference, moderate alcohol intake (12-35 g/day) was associated with a significantly decreased likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in men (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.16-0.74) and in women (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High alcohol intake (more than 48 g/day) was associated with an increased likelihood, which was significant in men (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.35-8.83) but not in women (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 0.50-22.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Drinking red wine was associated with reduced odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, significant in men (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.96) but not in women (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.23-1.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the associations between other beverage types and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was independently associated with lower odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> overall (p &lt; 0.001), in men (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83-0.97), and in women (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The major limitations of this study included the inability of a case-control design to determine causation and the potential for recall bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association between quantity of alcohol consumed and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> followed a J-shaped curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While demonstrating the detrimental effect of consuming large amounts of alcohol, the results of this study suggest that moderate alcohol consumption exerts a protective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in both men and women, possibly related to the effects of red wine </plain></SENT>
