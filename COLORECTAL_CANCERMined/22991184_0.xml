<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> extraction method includes homogenization, heat and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> conjugase treatment to hydrolyze polyglutamyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> to monoglutamyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before analysis on LC-MS/MS, simple and fast sample purification with ultrafiltration (molecular weight cut-off membrane, 10â€‰kDa) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folates</z:chebi> were detected and quantified using positive electrospray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method described in the present paper was successfully applied to determine the level of three <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> monoglutamates in mucosa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from 77 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, starting from a limited amount of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the LC-MS/MS method has a great advantage over other previously used methods because of its high sensitivity and selectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher levels of methyleneTHF and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> compared with matched mucosa tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> levels in adjacent mucosa were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, age and gender </plain></SENT>
