<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinically relevant targets for developmental drug efficacy in animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are critical yet understudied parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cetuximab, a chimeric antibody to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), was administered to athymic mice bearing subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> established with 13 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines of varying biomarker status, defined by DNA sequencing and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: If <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibition is taken as a target, as is commonly done, then in contrast to the clinical situation where KRAS mutation strongly predicts for a lack of clinically meaningful benefit in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, cetuximab alone and in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy were efficacious in a similar proportion of KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was only when <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> was utilized to define relevant efficacy that cetuximab monotherapy was efficacious in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, but not mutant models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adding cytotoxic therapy to cetuximab treatment increased <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> frequency in both genotypes to the point that once again the response was similar for KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data support shifting the threshold for claiming clinically relevant targeted therapy efficacy in subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> towards <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp>, rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibition, focusing on the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells that are addicted to the pathways being targeted </plain></SENT>
