<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we applied a practical method for examining CTCs to evaluate the effects of chemotherapy on advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even in stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, CTCs were detected in only 38.5% (n=5/13) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in cases where CTCs were detected, the change in the number of CTCs compared before and after chemotherapy appeared to be associated with the therapeutic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in the number of CTCs may be a good predictive biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Problems with this method are yet to be resolved, including the detection rate and the stability of the sample source for subsequent molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
