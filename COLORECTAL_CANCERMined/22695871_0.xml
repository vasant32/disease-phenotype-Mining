<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Coffee and tea are widely consumed globally and are rich sources of potential chemopreventive compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic data for coffee and tea intakes in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite differences in gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, few studies have conducted investigations by anatomic subsites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated coffee and tea intakes (caffeinated and decaffeinated) in relation to colon (proximal and distal) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study included 489,706 men and women who completed a baseline (1995-1996) self-administered questionnaire of demographics, diet, and lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over a median of 10.5 y of follow-up, we identified 2863 proximal colon, 1993 distal colon, and 1874 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable HRs and 95% CIs were estimated by using Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 16% of participants drank ≥4 cups coffee/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with nondrinkers, drinkers of 4-5 cups coffee/d (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.96) and ≥6 cups coffee/d (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.89; P-trend &lt; 0.001) had a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, particularly of proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (HR for ≥6 cups/d: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.81; P-trend &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were similar to those overall for drinkers of predominantly caffeinated coffee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although individual HRs were not significant, there was a significant P-trend for both colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> for people who drank predominantly decaffeinated coffee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No associations were observed for tea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large US cohort, coffee was inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, particularly proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additional investigations of coffee intake and its components in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by subsites are warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00340015 </plain></SENT>
