<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of BAY 86-9766, a selective, potent, orally available, small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase 1/2 in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BAY 86-9766 was administered orally daily in 28-day courses, with doses escalated to establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An expanded cohort was evaluated at the MTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed, with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation evaluated in paired biopsies from a subset of the expanded MTD cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> specimens were evaluated for mutations in select genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled, including 20 patients at the MTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MTD was 100 mg given once-daily or in two divided doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BAY 86-9766 was well-tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common treatment-related toxicities were acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> and gastrointestinal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BAY 86-9766 was well-absorbed after oral administration (plasma half-life ~12 hours), and displayed dose proportional pharmacokinetics throughout the tested dose range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Continuous daily dosing resulted in moderate accumulation at most dose levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BAY 86-9766 suppressed ERK phosphorylation in biopsied tissue and tetradecanoylphorbol <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of 53 evaluable patients, one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> achieved a partial response and 11 patients had stable disease for 4 or more courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> specimen harbored a GNAQ-activating mutation and exhibited reduced ERK phosphorylation in response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This phase I study showed that BAY 86-9766 was well-tolerated, with good oral absorption, dose proportional pharmacokinetics, target inhibition at the MTD, and some evidence of clinical benefit across a range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
