<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study with 880 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 848 controls was conducted to investigate whether variations in the catalase (CAT) gene, one of the genes involved in scavenging <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, influenced susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The interaction between life style and genotypes as well as with their effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was deduced from the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant difference (P = 0.01) was identified in the distribution of CAT genotype between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases had significantly lower mean activity than the controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation analyses revealed statistically significant correlations between CAT activity and CAT genotype (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was associated with smoking, low vegetable consumption, high pork and poultry consumptions, and low or high BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first study reporting an association of polymorphism CAT-21A &gt; T with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low CAT activity was associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; however, no evidence was found to support an association between CAT-21A &gt; T polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
