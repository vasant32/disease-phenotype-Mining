<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two prospectively collected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection specimens were histologically prepared, using standard paraffin-embedded and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-Eosin staining method; for immunohistochemical study, the Streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi> (sABC)/Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) method was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: P53 was positive in 86.36% of cases, more intense (&gt;50%) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and in women 59.16 ± 9.49-year-old; the G1/2 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 was positive in 18.18% of the cases, in distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, only in men, 63.5 ± 13.2-year-old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PTEN was positive in 95.45% of the cases; intense positivity was recorded in 12 men and six women, 61.47 ± 11.67-year-old, in rectal topography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 was positive in 86.36% of the cases, more intense in four men and four women, 63.45 ± 12.22-year-old, in proximal and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (pT3N1/2 - 62.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> suppressor genes mutations are often present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; the intensity of the expression of these mutations varies, which could explain the different prognosis for these patients </plain></SENT>
