<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Incidence data from 1993-2009 were obtained from the Korea National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Incidence Database, and vital status was followed through 31 December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality data from 1983-2009 were obtained from Statistics Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crude rates and age-standardized rates for incidence, mortality, and prevalence; and relative survival were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 192,561 cancer cases and 69,780 cancer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed during 2009, and 808,503 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevalent cases occurred in Korea as of 1 January 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> combined showed an annual increase of 3.3% from 1999 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stomach, liver and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancers</z:e> have been decreasing and thyroid, breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> have been increasing at large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, in 2009, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> became the third most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in females and for the first time ranked higher than <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancer</z:hpo>, which had been the long-standing common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence has been rapidly increasing in Korea, age-standardized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality rates have been declining since 2002, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survival has been improving </plain></SENT>
