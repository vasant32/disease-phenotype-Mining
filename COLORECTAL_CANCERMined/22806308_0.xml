<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and WAVE3 expression in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and to evaluate their clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We first performed real-time PCR to evaluate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of MMP-9 and WAVE3 in 21 pairs of fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples matched with adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, MMP-9 and WAVE3 proteins were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue microarrays which included 216 CRC specimens and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa, and their correlation with clinicopathological factors and overall survival after surgery was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry evaluation have demonstrated that MMP-9 and WAVE3 were over-expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 expression was significantly higher in patients with low-grade differentiation and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p = 0.003 and p = 0.005, respectively), and patients with MMP-9-positive expression had a poorer prognosis (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, patients with WAVE3-positive expression had a better prognosis (p = 0.039) and particularly favorable prognostic factors, including non-lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, non-distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and early TNM stage (p = 0.029, 0.021, and 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, MMP-9-negative/WAVE3-positive patients had the best overall survival (p = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate survival analysis, MMP-9 expression and combined expression status of MMP-9/WAVE3 were identified as independent prognostic factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (p = 0.046 and p = 0.019, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined analysis of MMP-9 and WAVE3 has a significant value for assessing prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients after surgery </plain></SENT>
