<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> catabolizing enzyme 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) is overexpressed with a potentially significant, positive impact on the catabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanism of CYP24A1 overexpression is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated possible causes including hypomethylation of the CYP24A1 promoter, amplification of the CYP24A1 gene locus (20q13.2), and altered expression of CYP24A1-specific transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We quantified CYP24A1 gene copy-number, performed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing of the CYP24A1 promoter to assess DNA methylation, and measured <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of CYP24A1, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> X receptor (RXR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that 77 (60%) out of 127 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed increased CYP24A1 gene copy-number and that more than 6 copies of CYP24A1 correlated positively with CYP24A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression suggestive of a causal relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences in CYP24A1 promoter methylation were found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue and adjacent mucosa from the same patient or between tissues with high or low <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, thus excluding DNA hypomethylation as a possible cause of CYP24A1 overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of several factors involved in replication licensing positively correlated with CYP24A1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, raising the possibility that CYP24A1 overexpression might favor increased proliferation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by suppressing local 1,25-D3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that high copy-number gain is a key determinant of CYP24A1 overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other postulated causes of CYP24A1 over-expression including promoter hypomethylation and enhanced VDR and/or RXR expression do not appear to be involved. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
