<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Previously, we have shown that p27 may be a potential predictive biomarker for the selection of premenopausal women with early-stage hormone-responsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> for adjuvant <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to assess the clinical relevance of p27 expression in postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients who were treated with adjuvant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined the expression of p27 by immunohistochemistry in the surgical specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> patients who had been enrolled in Austrian Breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Study Group Trial 06 and received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early relapse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within the first 5 years of follow-up were analyzed using Cox models adjusted for clinical and pathologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p27 expression was high (&gt;70% p27-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells) in 252 of 483 (52%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens and was associated with favorable outcome of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with high p27 expression had a significantly longer disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio for relapse, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.42; P &lt; 0.001) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.72; P = 0.002) as compared with women with low p27 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low p27 expression independently predicts early relapse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in postmenopausal women with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> who received adjuvant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> for 5 years </plain></SENT>
