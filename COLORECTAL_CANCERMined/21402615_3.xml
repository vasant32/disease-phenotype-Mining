<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional and multicentre study was carried out in tertiary hospitals in 11 Asian cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects comprise 2752 asymptomatic patients undergoing screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a development set of 860 asymptomatic subjects undergoing screening colonoscopy, multiple logistic regression was applied to identify significant risk factors for advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> defined as invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ORs for significant risk factors were utilised to develop a risk score ranging from 0 to 7 (Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three tiers of risk were arbitrarily defined: 0-1 'average risk' (AR); 2-3 'moderate risk' (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>); and 4-7 'high risk' (HR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects undergoing screening colonoscopy between July 2006 and December 2007 were prospectively enrolled to form an independent validation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each subject had a personal APCS score calculated by summing the points attributed from the presence of risk factors in the individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The performance of the APCS score in predicting risk of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 860 subjects in the derivation set and 1892 subjects in the validation set, with a baseline prevalence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of 4.5% and 3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Applying the APCS stratification in the validation set, 559 subjects (29.5%) were in the AR tier, 966 subjects (51.1%) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> tier and 367 (19.4%) subjects in the HR tier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the AR, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and HR groups was 1.3, 3.2 and 5.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The subjects in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and HR tiers had 2.6-fold (95% CI 1.1 to 6.0) and 4.3-fold (95% CI 1.8 to 10.3) increased prevalence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, respectively, than those in the AR tier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The APCS score based on age, gender, family history and smoking is useful in selecting asymptomatic Asian subjects for priority of colorectal screening </plain></SENT>
