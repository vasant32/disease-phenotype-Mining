<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on the methods of Cochrane systematic reviews, databases including CBM(1982 to March 2011), CNKI(1911 to March 2011), EMBASE(1966 to March 2011), and Medline(1950 to March 2011) were searched to identify randomized controlled trials assessing the benefit of fluorouracil implants on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane's tool for assessing bias </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included(n=1223) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The quality of included studies was moderate </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in complications and adverse effects between fluorouracil implants and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence demonstrates that fluorouracil implants may modestly improve the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients without increasing its adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the risk of bias of included studies </plain></SENT>
