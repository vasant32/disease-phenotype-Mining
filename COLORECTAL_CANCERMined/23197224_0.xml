<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) prevalence has increased dramatically in the United States since the early 1970s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though T2DM is known to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), information on racial differences in the relationship between T2DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, we compared the association between T2DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, including subsites of the colon, in African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) in South Carolina, a region with large racial disparities in rates of both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 91,836 individuals who were ≥30 years old on 1 January 1990 and had ≥12 months of South Carolina Medicaid eligibility between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 1995 were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> data from 1996 to 2007 included information on anatomic subsite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects who had T2DM (n = 6,006) were &gt;50 % more likely to be diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> compared to those without T2DM (n = 85,681) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between T2DM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was higher in AAs [odds ratio (OR) = 1.72 (95 % confidence interval: 1.21, 2.46); n = 47,984] than among EAs (OR = 1.24; 0.73, 2.11; n = 43,703) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, individuals with T2DM were over twice as likely to be diagnosed with in situ or local <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (OR = 2.12; 1.40, 3.22; n = 191) compared to those without T2DM, with a higher likelihood among AAs (OR = 2.49; 1.52, 4.09; n = 113) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results from a Medicaid population in a high-risk region of the United States showed an increased likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with T2DM and suggest a racial disparity that disfavors AAs and provides further impetus for efforts aimed at <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention in this group </plain></SENT>
