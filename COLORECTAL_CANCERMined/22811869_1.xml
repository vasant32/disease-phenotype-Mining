<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical management of patients with resectable synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> is complex and must consider multiple factors, including the presence of symptoms, location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (both primary and metastatic), patient performance status, and underlying comorbidities </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The available literature regarding the safety of synchronous versus staged approaches confirms that a simultaneous resection may be performed in selected patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The available data suggest equivalent overall and disease-free survival regardless of timing of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Experience with minimally invasive combined colorectal and hepatic resections is extremely limited to date and consists exclusively of small single center series </plain></SENT>
