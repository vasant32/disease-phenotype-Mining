<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Irinotecan (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11) is widely used for the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the adverse effects associated with the treatment have hindered the efficacies of irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that organic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26628">selenium compounds</z:chebi> could significantly attenuate irinotecan-associated toxicity and enhance antitumor activity in xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to determine the role of a specific group of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi> glucuronosyltransferases, which is coded by UGT1A, in detoxification process of irinotecan as well as <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>-associated protective effect against irinotecan-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, the toxicities of irinotecan, docetaxel and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> in the Ugta1 mutant rats and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentrations of irinotecan and SN-38 were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The modulatory effect of a <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> compound on irinotecan-induced toxicity was analyzed in these rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated that the maximum tolerated doses of irinotecan in the homozygous mutant rats were significantly lower than those in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> rats, 25 mg/kg × 1 versus 200 mg/kg �� 1 and 3 mg/kg/day × 3 versus 100 mg/kg/day × 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The enhanced sensitivity was specific to irinotecan and was not observed with other chemotherapeutic agents, such as docetaxel and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, where Ugt1a is not required for their metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results also showed that selective protection against irinotecan-induced toxicity by 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27812">methylselenocysteine</z:chebi> was achieved in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> rats but not in the Ugt1a null rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that expression of UGT1A is critical for 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27812">methylselenocysteine</z:chebi> to exert its protective effect against irinotecan-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
