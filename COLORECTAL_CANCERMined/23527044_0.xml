<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the expression of COX-2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> have become an issue; thus, attention has been paid to COX-2 as a prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various studies examined the relationship between COX-2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) overexpression with the clinical outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but yielded conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of COX-2 overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electronic databases updated to October 2012 were searched to find relevant studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was conducted with eligible studies which quantitatively evaluated the relationship between COX-2 overexpression and survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival data were aggregated and quantitatively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of 23 studies (n  =  4567 patients) that evaluated the correlation between COX-2 overexpression detected by IHC and survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined hazard ratios suggested that COX-2 overexpression had an unfavorable impact on overall survival (OS) (HR [hazard ratio]  =  1.193, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.02 ∼ 1.37), but not disease free survival (DFS) (HR  =  1.25, 95% CI: 0.99 ∼ 1.50) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cox-2 overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detected by IHC appears to have slightly worse overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic value of COX-2 on survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> still needs further large-scale prospective trials to be clarified </plain></SENT>
