<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> invasion according to seven intrapelvic compartments for planning exenterative pelvic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sixty-three consecutive patients underwent preoperative MRI planning for exenterative surgery, defined as operative excision beyond conventional mesenteric planes for locally advanced (n=23) and recurrent (n=41) pelvic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The institutional research committee approved of the study and waived the need for a consent form as the images were retrospectively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion for each of seven anatomic surgical resection compartments, blinded to histopathology and the intraoperative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated for the seven intrapelvic compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall interobserver agreement was assessed using Cohen's Kappa coefficient (k) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity of MRI was â‰¥93.3% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but the lateral compartment where it was 89.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specificity for the posterior (82.2%) and anterior compartments below the peritoneal reflection (86.4%) was lower compared to the other compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Agreement between the two radiologists was found to be good or very good for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compartments (k&gt;0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An MRI diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion in the anterior compartment above the peritoneal reflection was associated with a poorer survival (p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI is accurate in predicting the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> within the pelvis and therefore can be used to determine the type of surgery required for curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It should always be used to stage patients with advanced colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751416" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pelvic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
