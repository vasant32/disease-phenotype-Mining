<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested a detrimental prognostic effect of preoperative obstruction proximal to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If such a detrimental effect is preserved in each stage of advanced (stage II or III) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we can identify high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 641 patients with pathologically confirmed advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (stage II, n = 207; stage III, n = 434) who had undergone curative resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of preoperative obstruction with clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the effect of preoperative obstruction on disease-free survival in each stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative obstruction was seen in 63 patients (9.8%) (stage II, n = 16; stage III, n = 47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that preoperative obstruction was significantly associated with preoperative elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen level in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (odds ratio = 3.59; P &lt; 0.001), while it was correlated with poor differentiation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (odds ratio = 3.99; P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative obstruction was a significant prognostic factor in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001), but not in stage II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariable prognostic analysis showed that preoperative obstruction was a remnant independent prognostic factor in stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding was confirmed by separate analyses of colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperative obstruction was associated with systemic recurrence (P = 0.003) rather than peritoneal or local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that preoperative obstruction may predict worse long-term prognosis in patients with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and may be a potential clinical marker to identify patients with high-risk stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
