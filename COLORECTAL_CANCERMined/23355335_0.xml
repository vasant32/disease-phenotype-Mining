<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between CYP2E1 gene Rsa I/Pst I, Dral T/A and 96-bp insertion polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, and Chinese Biomedicine Databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for CYP2E1 polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were calculated in a fixed-effect model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, 12, 5, and 4 studies were found to be eligible for meta-analyses of Rsa I/Pst I, Dral T/A, and 96-bp insertion polymorphisms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analysis suggested that the variant genotype of Rsa I/Pst I were associated with a significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (c2/c2 vs. c1/c1, OR = 1.36, 95 % CI = 1.04-1.77; recessive model, OR = 1.35, 95 % CI = 1.04-1.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, similar results were observed between CYP2E1 96-bp insertion polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (dominant model, OR = 1.25, 95 % CI = 1.07-1.45), while no association was observed between CYP2E1 Dral T/A polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility in any genetic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No publication bias was found in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis shows that CYP2E1 Rsa I/Pst I and 96-bp insertion polymorphisms may be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CYP2E1 Dral T/A polymorphism was not detected to be related to the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
