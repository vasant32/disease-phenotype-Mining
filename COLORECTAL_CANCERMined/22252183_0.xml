<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: With improvements in surgical techniques, instrumentation and perioperative care, Hartmann's procedure is now less frequently performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restoration of intestinal continuity after Hartmann's procedure has traditionally been viewed to be technically demanding and associated with significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a study of outcomes after the reversal of Hartmann's procedure in an Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospectively collected database showed that 255 patients had undergone Hartmann's procedure from October 1989 to October 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who subsequently underwent Hartmann's reversal were identified and their records reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hartmann's reversal was attempted in 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common indication for Hartmann's procedure was colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (49.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median interval between resection and reversal was 23 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reversal was successful in 46 (93.9%) patients, with 79.6% experiencing no intraoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Failure of reversal was significantly associated with prior radiotherapy to the pelvis (p-value = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic leak rates and re-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rates were both 0.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>79.6% of patients made an uneventful recovery with no postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increase in the complication rate in older patients or patients with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of 30-day morbidity and mortality was 20.4% and 0.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our population, Hartmann's procedure is more commonly performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> rather than for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e>, resulting in lower rates of stoma reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hartmann's reversal could be performed with acceptable morbidity and minimal mortality, although prior radiotherapy and shorter rectal stump may pose challenges during reversal surgery </plain></SENT>
