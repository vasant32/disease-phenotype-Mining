<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FOLFOX-4 regimen is safe and widely used in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, yielding interesting results with little toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the safety and the effectiveness of FOLFOX-4 in cirrhotic or liver transplanted patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> ineligible for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty seven patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The medical record of either cirrhotic patients or liver transplanted patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> receiving FOLFOX-4 regimen between November 1999 and March 2006 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 85 mg/m(2) as a 2-hour infusion on day one, and leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) as a 2-hour infusion followed by bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> 400 mg/m(2) and a 48-hours infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> 2400 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable adverse effects occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had a Child-Pugh class A (n = 16), class B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (n = 10) or a liver transplant (n = 11) and received 2 to 37 cycles of chemotherapy (total of 310 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two (5.4%) cirrhotic patients developed neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and one (2.7%) toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At first assessment, five patients from Child-Pugh class A (33%) and two from Child-Pugh class B group (20%) achieved a radiological response and/or alpha foeto-protein decrease, and no patient achieved a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, with a manageable toxicity profile in cirrhotic Child-Pugh class A-B or liver transplanted patients, the FOLFOX-4 regimen appears to be a feasible treatment option for patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> unfit for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
