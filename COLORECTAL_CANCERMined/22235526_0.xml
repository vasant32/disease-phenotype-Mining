<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One study examines the effects of instruction design on adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> self-screening instructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second study examines the effect of persuasive announcements on increasing screening campaign participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The first study examined adherence to screening (operationalized as returning results for evaluation) given standard instructions, or one of three other versions: persuasive, human factored, or a combination of the two.The second study investigated combining persuasion with a campaign announcement to increase participation (operationalized as picking up a test kit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first study found that among first-time participants, the persuasive and human-factored instructions evoked higher result return rates than did the standard </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Enhancing motivation and reducing cognitive barriers increase adherence to test instructions and increase participation </plain></SENT>
