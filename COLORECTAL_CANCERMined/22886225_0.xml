<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the miRCURY™ Array® <z:chebi fb="17" ids="48010">LNA</z:chebi> microRNA chip (v.14.0) to evaluate miRNA expression levels between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> tissues and adjacent non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues; an average change more than 2-fold (and P value less than 0.05) was set as a cutoff level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> were classified pathology stage C or D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-eight miRNAs were up-regulated and 46 miRNAs have been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; 40 miRNAs were down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> and 15 miRNAs have been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To compare the relative miRNA expression levels as measured by RT-qPCR and chip analysis, we analyzed expression levels of these miRNAs in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that miRNA expression (increased or decreased) in the paired benign and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue was consistent between the two methods in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of 6 up-regulated miRNAs (by chip analysis compared to RT-qPCR) varied in a range from -11.9% to 39.1%  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of 5 down-regulated miRNAs varied in a range from 1.4% to 29.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Pearson correlation of relative miRNAs expression levels was analyzed by cDNA array versus RT-qPCR, and found to be 0.96 (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: miRNA profile in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> showed unique characteristics, and identified a series of new, aberrantly expressed miRNAs </plain></SENT>
