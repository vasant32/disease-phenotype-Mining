<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although more than two third of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are localized on the left side, recent studies suggest a right ward shift in anatomical distribution with increase in proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the anatomical distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a referral center over a 15 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Records of patients who underwent colectomy in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute of Iran from 1994 to 2009 were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data including anatomical localization, year of diagnosis, patient age and gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology and differentiation, and disease stage were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> located from the cecum to the distal transverse colon were classified as right side and those occurring from the splenic flexure to the descending colon as left-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer of rectum</z:e> and recto-sigmoid junction were considered as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 442 patients including 220 (49/8%) men and 222 (50/2%) women with mean age 53 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients were in stages II and III (47.1% and 33% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 157 (35.5 %) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> and 285 (64.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>43.3% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> were right sided and 56.7% were left sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant increase in right sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during the period of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in age at diagnosis, gender, grade and stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> between the right and the left sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No proximal shift over time was identified in our study </plain></SENT>
