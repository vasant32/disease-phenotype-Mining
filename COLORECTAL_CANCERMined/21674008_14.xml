<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The evidence that red and processed meat influences colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> was judged convincing in the 2007 World <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research Fund/American Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, ten prospective studies have published new results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we update the evidence from prospective studies and explore whether there is a non-linear association of red and processed meats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: Relevant prospective studies were identified in PubMed until March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each study, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted and pooled with a random-effects model, weighting for the inverse of the variance, in highest versus lowest intake comparison, and dose-response meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Red and processed meats intake was associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The summary relative risk (RR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> for the highest versus the lowest intake was 1.22 (95% CI  =  1.11-1.34) and the RR for every 100 g/day increase was 1.14 (95% CI  =  1.04-1.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-linear dose-response meta-analyses revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk increases approximately linearly with increasing intake of red and processed meats up to approximately 140 g/day, where the curve approaches its plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The associations were similar for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When analyzed separately, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk was related to intake of fresh red meat (RR(for 100 g/day increase)  =  1.17, 95% CI  =  1.05-1.31) and processed meat (RR (for 50 g/day increase)  =  1.18, 95% CI  =  1.10-1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, but for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, no significant associations were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High intake of red and processed meat is associated with significant increased risk of colorectal, colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall evidence of prospective studies supports limiting red and processed meat consumption as one of the dietary recommendations for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
