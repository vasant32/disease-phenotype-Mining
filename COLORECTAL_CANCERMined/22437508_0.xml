<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the analysis stratifies on the cells formed by crossing the stratification variables, these other randomization methods yield treatment effect estimates with larger variance than does stratified permuted blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When it is truly necessary to balance the randomization on many stratification variables, it is shown how this inefficiency can be improved by using a sequential randomization method where the first level balances on the crossing of the strata used in the analysis and further stratification variables fall lower in the sequential hierarchy </plain></SENT>
