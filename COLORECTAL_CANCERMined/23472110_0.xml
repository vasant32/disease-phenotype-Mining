<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By harmonizing data from 15 previous reports, we found widespread inconsistencies across prior studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether this arises from differences in study design, such as sample source or profiling platform, is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a reproducibility experiment, we generated a genome-wide plasma miRNA dataset using the Illumina oligoarray and compared this to a publically available dataset generated using an identical sample size, substrate and profiling platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples from 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, 20 mammography-screened controls, as well as 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients after surgical resection and 10 female lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After filtering for miRNAs derived from blood cells, and for low abundance miRNAs (non-detectable in over 10% of samples), a set of 522 plasma miRNAs remained, of which 46 were found to be differentially expressed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients and healthy controls (p&lt;0.05), of which only 3 normalized to baseline levels in post-resection cases and were unique to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> vs. lung or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (miR-708*, miR-92b* and miR-568, none previously reported) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We were unable to demonstrate reproducibility by various measures between the two datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding, along with widespread inconsistencies across prior studies, highlight the need for better understanding of factors influencing circulating miRNA levels as prerequisites to progress in this area of translational research </plain></SENT>
