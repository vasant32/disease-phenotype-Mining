<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> data were abstracted from the annual statistical reports of the P.A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hertzen Research Institute of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> in Moscow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual number and percent of cases, crude and age-standardized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence (ASIR) and mortality (ASMR) rates per 100,000 among men and women in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug were determined for the period 1997-2010 for incidence and 1999-2010 for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two years' data were aggregated to generate temporal trends during the period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In age-standardization, the Segi-Doll world standard population used by the International Agency for Research on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The higher incidence and mortality rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites combined) among men compared to women, which was observed in Russia nationally, was reflected also in Chukotka, although the difference between men and women was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites are similar between Chukotka and Russia, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684249,C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the lung</z:e>/trachea/bronchus and stomach occupying the top ranks among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Oesophageal cancer</z:e> is common in Chukotka but not in Russia, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> is common in Russia but not in Chukotka </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> is either the commonest or second commonest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in terms of incidence or mortality in both Chukotka and Russia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684249,C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer of the lung</z:e>/trachea/bronchi ranks higher in Chukotka than in Russia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites combined during the 13-year period was relatively stable in Russia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dividing the period into two halves, an increase among both men and women was observed in Chukotka for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites combined, and also for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents previously unavailable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> epidemiological data on Chukotka </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>They provide a basis for comparative studies across circumpolar regions and countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>With its small population, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rates in Chukotka tend to be highly unstable and fluctuate widely from year to year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Even when aggregated over a decade or more, only broad conclusions regarding patterns and trends can be made regarding some of the commonest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites, or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Chukotka experienced substantial social and economic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> during the period under study, which could conceivably affect risk factor distribution and the quality of medical care </plain></SENT>
