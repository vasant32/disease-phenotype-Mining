<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to summarize the data on the potential association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pubmed, Embase and CBM databases were searched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Links between the TSER 2R/3R polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven case-control studies with a total of 2723 cases and 4030 controls were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the 3R variant of TSER 2R/3R polymorphism contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in two comparison models (OR 3R vs. 2R =1.10, 95%CI 1.02-1.18, P = 0.015; OR Homozygote comparison model = 1.22 1.04-1.43, 95%CI 1.04- 1.43, P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses by ethnicity further demonstrated a contribution in Caucasians with three comparison models (OR 3R vs. 2R = 1.10, 95%CI 1.02-1.19, P = 0.015; OR Homozygote comparison model = 1.21, 95%CI 1.03-1.41, P = 0.019; OR Recessive comparison model = 1.18, 95%CI 1.05-1.33, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the association in the Asian population was still uncertain due to the limited data (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values were more than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that the 3R variant of Thymidylate synthase 5'-untranslated enhanced region 2R/3R polymorphism contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> risk in the Caucasian population, while any association in Asian populations needs further study </plain></SENT>
