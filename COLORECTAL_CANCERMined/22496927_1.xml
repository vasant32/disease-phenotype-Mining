<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the prognostic impact of <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-gò-gò-related gene 1 channels and some <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> markers, in patients with nonmetastatic (stage I, II, and III) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of hERG1, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 1, carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), and p53 was tested by immunohistochemistry in 135 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 35 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic parameters and overall survival were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: hERG1 displayed a statistically significant association with Glut-1, VEGF-A, CA-IX, and EGF-R; p53 with VEGF-A and CA-IX; Glut-1 with the age of the patients; and EGF-R with TNM and mucin content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TNM and CA-IX were prognostic factors at the univariate analysis; TNM, hERG1, and Glut-1, at the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk scores calculated from the final multivariate model allowed to stratify patients into four different risk groups: A) stage I-II, Glut-1 positivity, any hERG1; B) stage I-II, Glut-1 and hERG1 negativity; C) stage I-II, Glut-1 negativity, hERG1 positivity; D) stage III, any Glut-1 and any hERG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: hERG1 positivity with Glut-1 negativity identifies a patient group with poor prognosis within stage I-II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possibility that these patients might benefit from adjuvant therapy, independently from the TNM stage, is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: More robust prognostic and predictive markers, supplementing standard clinical and pathologic staging, are needed for node-negative patients </plain></SENT>
