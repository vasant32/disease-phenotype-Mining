<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This multicenter phase II study was designed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, levoforinate, and infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (FOLFOX4) as a second-line therapy for Japanese patients with unresectable advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 53 patients with progressive disease after first-line chemotherapy were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment was repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred, or the patient chose to discontinue the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients were ineligible and one did not receive the protocol therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the response rate, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated in 48 patients; toxicity was evaluated in 52 patients, excluding the patient who had not received the protocol therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A partial response was observed in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 20.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.5%-35.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.0 months) and the median OS was 19.6 months (95% CI, 11.4-24.3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequently encountered grade 3/4 hematological symptom was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (43.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The toxicity profile was generally predictable and manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results showed good tolerability and efficacy for second-line FOLFOX4 in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, thus indicating the promise of this regimen as an effective second-line therapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
