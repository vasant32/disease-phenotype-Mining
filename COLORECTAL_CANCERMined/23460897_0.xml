<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Recent evidence suggests that several dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi> may exert their chemopreventive effect through epigenetic modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> is one of the most widely studied dietary chemopreventive agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> prevention, however, its effects on epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA methylation, remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using systematic genome-wide approaches, we aimed to elucidate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on DNA methylation alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on DNA methylation, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, HCT116, HT29 and RKO, were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-aza-CdR) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi> treated cells were used as positive and negative controls for DNA methylation changes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation status of LINE-1 repeat elements, DNA promoter methylation microarrays and gene expression arrays were used to assess global methylation and gene expression changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Validation was performed using independent microarrays, quantitative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> pyrosequencing, and qPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, genome-wide methylation microarrays revealed significant DNA hypomethylation in 5-aza-CdR-treated cells (mean β-values of 0.12), however, non-significant changes in mean β-values were observed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison to mock-treated cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-induced DNA methylation alterations occurred in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the generalized, non-specific global hypomethylation observed with 5-aza-CdR, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment resulted in methylation changes at selected, partially-methylated loci, instead of fully-methylated CpG sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation alterations were supported by corresponding changes in gene expression at both up- and down-regulated genes in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide previously unrecognized evidence for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-mediated DNA methylation alterations as a potential mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> chemoprevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast to non-specific global hypomethylation induced by 5-aza-CdR, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-induced methylation changes occurred only in a subset of partially-methylated genes, which provides additional mechanistic insights into the potent chemopreventive effect of this dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50733">nutraceutical</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
