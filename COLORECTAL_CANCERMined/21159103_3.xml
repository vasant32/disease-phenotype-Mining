<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal strategy for resectable synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although some authors advocate a staged treatment, an increasing number of studies have reported that combined colorectal and liver resection is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic combined resection in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> has been reported but there are no specific data for major liver resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the feasibility of a simultaneous entirely laparoscopic procedure, in the light of the benefits of laparoscopy in both colon and liver surgery, and discussed the benefits of this strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two cases are presented of totally laparoscopic major liver resections associated with laparoscopic colorectal resections for synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> with the emphasis on the technical aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Duration of surgery, blood loss and post-operative outcome were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: â€‚ Laparoscopic right hepatectomy or left hepatectomy with simultaneous colon resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> was feasible and safe with only one suprapubic 5-mm trocar added to the usual trocar sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of surgery was 327 min with a mean estimated blood loss of 200 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The post-operative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In selected patients, laparoscopic major hepatectomies for unilobular synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> can be safely performed simultaneously with colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
