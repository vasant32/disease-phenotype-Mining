<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Questionnaires survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Medical hospitals in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six medical doctors from 5 November 2009 to 10 December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measure(s) Performance measures (two pre-treatment, six treatment related and three monitoring related) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight doctors responded and returned questionnaires (response rate 72.7%) with surgeons and physicians contributing equally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important measure was the proportion of colorectal patients who had pre-operative examinations that included chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography or MRI (global priority: 0.144), followed by the proportion of stages I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who had undergone a wide surgical resection documented as 'negative margin' (global priority: 0.133) and the proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who had undergone surgery with a pathology report that included information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and node differentiation (global priority: 0.116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most participants considered that the best interval for the renewal indicators was 3-5 years (43.75%) followed by 5-10 years (27.08%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To design a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53315">PFP</z:chebi> program, the AHP method is a useful technique to prioritize performance measures, especially in a highly specialized domain such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
