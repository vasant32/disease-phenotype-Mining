<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a population-based cohort study to assess the safety of BEV use among patients aged ≥65.Patients and methodsWe identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients diagnosed from 2005 to 2007 who received chemotherapy and were followed until 31 December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were 3-year risk of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (ATEs), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (CM/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>), and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (CD) after chemotherapy initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We fitted Cox-proportional hazards (<z:chebi fb="33" ids="29941">PHs</z:chebi>) models with inverse-probability-of-treatment-weights and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of adverse events.ResultsWe identified 6803 CRC patients (median age: 73 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with cardiac comorbidity were less likely to receive BEV (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BEV is associated with an elevated risk of ATEs (HR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.20-2.76, P &lt; 0.001; rate difference: 3.5 additional cases/1000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed no association between BEV and CD or CM/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>.ConclusionsIn general practice, the cardiovascular risk of BEV in elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed ATEs risk is lower than reported in clinical trials, which may be due to careful patient selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings may facilitate clinical decision-making of BEV use in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
