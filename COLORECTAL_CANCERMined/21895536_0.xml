<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the addition of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) to standard computed tomography (CT) evaluation would improve diagnostic and prognostic power of the measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response to oncolytic virotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A phase I/II trial was conducted to investigate treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> using intra-arterial administration of the oncolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> virus NV1020 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both contrast-enhanced CT and FDG PET were obtained on each patient at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative FDG PET and CT responses were correlated with each other and with clinical outcome metrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A majority of patients showed initial post-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> infusion increases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (69%) or in standardized uptake value (SUV) (80%) large enough to qualify as progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most showed subsequent decreases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (64%) or SUV (83%) enough to be reclassified as partial response or stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late PET and CT imaging results correlated well with each other and with clinical outcomes, but results from early in the treatment scheme did not correlate with each other, with later results, or with clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of FDG PET to the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response to the oncolytic virus NV1020 did not provide useful diagnostic or prognostic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More sophisticated molecular imaging will need to be developed to monitor the effects of this novel class of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
