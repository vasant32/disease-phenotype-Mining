<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Exosomes are 40-100nm extracellular vesicles that are released from a multitude of cell types, and perform diverse cellular functions including intercellular communication, antigen presentation, and transfer of oncogenic proteins as well as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and miRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exosomes have been purified from biological fluids and in vitro cell cultures using a variety of strategies and techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preparations invariably contain varying proportions of other membranous vesicles that co-purify with exosomes such as shed microvesicles and apoptotic <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>blebs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line LIM1863 as a cell model, in this study we performed a comprehensive evaluation of current methods used for exosome isolation including ultracentrifugation (UC-Exos), OptiPrepâ„¢ density-based separation (DG-Exos), and immunoaffinity capture using anti-EpCAM coated magnetic beads (IAC-Exos) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isolations contained 40-100nm vesicles, and were positive for exosome markers (Alix, TSG101, HSP70) based on electron microscopy and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We employed a proteomic approach to profile the protein composition of exosomes, and label-free spectral counting to evaluate the effectiveness of each method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the number of MS/MS spectra identified for exosome markers and proteins associated with their biogenesis, trafficking, and release, we found IAC-Exos to be the most effective method to isolate exosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, Alix, TSG101, CD9 and CD81 were significantly higher (at least 2-fold) in IAC-Exos, compared to UG-Exos and DG-Exos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Application of immunoaffinity capture has enabled the identification of proteins including the ESCRT-III component VPS32C/CHMP4C, and the SNARE synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2) in exosomes for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related proteins were identified in IAC-Exos including various ephrins (EFNB1, EFNB2) and Eph receptors (EPHA2-8, EPHB1-4), and components involved in Wnt (CTNNB1, TNIK) and Ras (CRK, GRB2) signalling </plain></SENT>
