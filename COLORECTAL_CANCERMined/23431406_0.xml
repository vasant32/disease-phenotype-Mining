<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported the utility of Low-Coherence Enhanced Backscattering (LEBS) Spectroscopy in detecting optical changes in uninvolved rectal mucosa, changes that are indicative of the presence of advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> elsewhere in the colon (field <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the alterations in optical signatures are due to structural changes in colonocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate those colonocyte changes, we used LEBS and an early time point in an animal model of colorectal field <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>--rats treated with azoxymethane (AOM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in LEBS markers in intact mucosa from AOM-treated rats could be at least partially attributed to changes in colonocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the colonocyte abnormalities in premalignant colon, we took a candidate approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared expression profiles of genes implicated directly or indirectly in cytoskeletal dysregulation in colorectal tissues from saline-treated versus AOM-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that a number of genes known to affect colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> are up-regulated in colonocytes, and genes previously reported to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> are down-regulated in colonocytes, despite the colonocytes being histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To further understand the role of the cytoskeleton in generating changes in optical markers of cells, we used pharmacological disruption (using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>) of the cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that differences in optical markers (between AOM- and control-treated rats) were negated by the disruption, suggesting cytoskeletal involvement in the optical changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies provide significant insights into the micro-architectural alterations in early colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, and may enable optimization of both bio-photonic and molecular risk stratification techniques to personalize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
