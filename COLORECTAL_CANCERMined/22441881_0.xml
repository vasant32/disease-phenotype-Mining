<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The significance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling has been recognized in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and anti-EGFR therapies in Japan are currently under consideration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the head and neck (SCCHN) similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there was no established survey regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> EGFR protein expression in Japanese SCCHN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between EGFR expression or KRAS mutation (related to the alteration of EGFR pathway) and the clinicopathological characteristics of SCCHN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined the expression of EGFR protein by immunohistochemistry and KRAS gene mutation at codons 12 and 13 by using paraffin-embedded and formalin-fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> tissues from 205 patients with SCCHN who underwent surgery at National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Hospital East </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 200 of the 205 patients (97.6 %), EGFR protein was expressed despite intratumoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patients had KRAS mutation at codons 12 or 13, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 183 tumors showed <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive rate of EGFR protein expression was significantly associated with better disease free survival (DFS) (P = 0.0471) and the intensity of EGFR protein expression showed a tendency for better DFS (P = 0.1034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both higher EGFR positive rate and more intense EGFR expression were significantly associated with well differentiated subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most SCCHN patients may be good candidates for the anti-EGFR therapies </plain></SENT>
