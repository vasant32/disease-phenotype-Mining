<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of clusterin overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells on sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and FOLFOX treatment under normoxic and graded hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SW480 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells were transfected with full length Clusterin cDNA to generate a clusterin overexpressing cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression was confirmed by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response of parental and clusterin overexpressing cells to 5-FU, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and FOLFOX was examined using a crystal violet-based proliferation assay under normoxic conditions, 3% and 1% hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and G2/M arrest in FOLFOX-treated cells were assessed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under normoxic conditions, clusterin overexpressing cells were more sensitive to FOLFOX treatment (p = 0.01); under 3% and 1% hypoxic conditions, overexpressing clusterin cells were more sensitive to 5-FU, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and FOLFOX, p values &lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under normoxic conditions, overexpressing clusterin cells showed significantly higher levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when treated with FOLFOX compared to untransfected cells; levels of G2M cells were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under both 3% and 1% <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, the percentage of cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following FOLFOX treatment was significantly higher in overexpressing clusterin cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These in vitro findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> expressing high levels of clusterin, particularly if hypoxic in nature, may benefit from treatments such as FOLFOX </plain></SENT>
