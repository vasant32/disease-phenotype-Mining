<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, endometrial or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1998 and 2008, as registered in the Eindhoven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, were eligible for participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 4446 survivors received a questionnaire including the EORTC-QLQ-INFO25 and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire; 69% responded (n = 3080) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> patients were most satisfied with the information they received, and they perceived to having received more information about their treatment and other services (after care) compared with colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> survivors (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>Multiple myeloma</z:hpo> patients reported the highest scores (conceptualized their illness as very serious) on the illness perception scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The perceived receipt of more disease-specific information was associated with more personal and treatment control and a better understanding of the illness, whereas the perceived receipt of more information about other services was associated with more negative consequences of the illness on the patients' life, longer perceived duration of illness, less treatment control, more symptoms attributable to the illness, less understanding of, and stronger emotional reaction to the illness (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction with the received information was associated with better illness perception on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subscales, except for personal control (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Improving the patients' illness perceptions by tailoring the information provision to the needs of patients may help patients to get a more coherent understanding of their illness and will possibly lead to a better health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
