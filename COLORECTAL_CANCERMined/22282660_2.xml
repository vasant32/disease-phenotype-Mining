<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the association of 24 MBL2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and corresponding haplotypes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk in a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four SNPs in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene (rs10082466, rs2120132, rs2099902, and rs10450310) were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ORs for homozygous variants versus <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ranged from 3.17 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.57-6.40] to 4.51 (95% CI, 1.94-10.50), whereas the 3'-UTR region haplotype consisting of these four variants had an OR of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.42-3.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The C allele of rs10082466 exhibited a binding affinity of miR-27a and this allele was associated with both lower MBL plasma levels and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 5' secretor haplotypes known to correlate with moderate and low MBL serum levels exhibited associations with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in African Americans, specifically as driven by two haplotypes, LYPA and LYQC, relative to the referent HYPA haplotype (LYPA: OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.33-5.08 and LYQC: OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.20-4.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar associations were not observed in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, our results support the hypothesis that genetic variations in MBL2 increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> susceptibility in African Americans </plain></SENT>
