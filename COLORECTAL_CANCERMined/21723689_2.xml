<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To analyse patient survival after the resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and specifically to verify whether presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> prior to lung metastasectomy affects survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who, between 1998 and 2008, underwent lung metastasectomy due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed with the log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During this period, 101 metastasectomies were performed on 84 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 65.4 years, and 60% of patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality rate was 2%, and incidence of complications was 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was 72 months, with 3-and 5-year survival rates of 70% and 54%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 patients (20%) had previously undergone resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the distribution of what were supposed to be the main variables between patients with and without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified the following statistically significant factors affecting survival: previous liver metastasectomy (p = 0.03), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-infiltrated pulmonary lymph nodes (p = 0.04), disease-free interval ≥ 48 months (p = 0.03), and presence of more than one lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, the shorter the time between primary colorectal surgery and the hepatectomy, the lower the survival rate after pulmonary metastasectomy (p = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> shortens survival after lung metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The time between hepatic resection and lung metastasectomy does not affect survival; however, patients with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> have poorer survival rates than those with metachronous disease </plain></SENT>
