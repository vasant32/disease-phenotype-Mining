<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg) and calcium (Ca) antagonise each other in (re)absorption, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and many other physiological activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on mathematical estimation, the absorbed number of Ca or Mg depends on the dietary ratio of Ca to Mg intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that the dietary Ca/Mg ratio modifies the effects of Ca and Mg on mortality due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal tract cancer</z:e> and, perhaps, mortality due to diseases occurring in other organs or systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Population-based cohort studies (The Shanghai Women's Health Study and the Shanghai Men's Health Study) conducted in Shanghai, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 74 942 Chinese women aged 40-70 years and 61 500 Chinese men aged 40-74 years participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality and disease-specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this Chinese population with a low Ca/Mg intake ratio (a median of 1.7 vs around 3.0 in US populations), intakes of Mg greater than US Recommended Daily Allowance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RDA</z:e>) levels (320 mg/day among women and 420 mg/day among men) were related to increased risks of total mortality for both women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our hypothesis, the Ca/Mg intake ratio significantly modified the associations of intakes of Ca and Mg with mortality risk, whereas no significant interactions between Ca and Mg in relation to outcome were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The associations differed by gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among men with a Ca/Mg ratio &gt;1.7, increased intakes of Ca and Mg were associated with reduced risks of total mortality, and mortality due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the same group, intake of Ca was associated with a reduced risk of mortality due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among women with a Ca/Mg ratio â‰¤1.7, intake of Mg was associated with increased risks of total mortality, and mortality due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results, if confirmed, may help to understand the optimal balance between Ca and Mg in the aetiology and prevention of these common diseases and reduction in mortality </plain></SENT>
