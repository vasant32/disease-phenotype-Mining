<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of Tu M2-PK in plasma using a survival analysis in combination with CEA in serum in patients newly diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial study included 183 patients who had a complete diagnostic colonoscopy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The univariate Cox's analysis showed that CEA and Tu M2-PK gave high hazard ratios for risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (odds ratio CEA = 3.57 and odds ratioTu M2-PK = 2.23) and comparable values in average survival time </plain></SENT>
