<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PLX4032) have proven effective in BRAF mutant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, they are surprisingly ineffective in BRAF mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, and the reason for this disparity remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to BRAF mutant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cells, BRAF mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells were less sensitive to vemurafenib, and P-ERK suppression was not sustained in response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although transient inhibition of phospho-ERK by vemurafenib was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, rapid ERK re-activation occurred through EGFR-mediated activation of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and CRAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> expressed higher levels of phospho-EGFR than BRAF mutant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo>, suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> are specifically poised for EGFR-mediated resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined RAF and EGFR inhibition blocked reactivation of MAPK signaling in BRAF mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and markedly improved efficacy in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support evaluation of combined RAF and EGFR inhibition in BRAF mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: BRAF valine 600 (V600) mutations occur in 10% to 15% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, yet these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> show a surprisingly low clinical response rate (~5%) to selective RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, which have produced dramatic response rates (60%â€“80%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo> harboring the identical BRAF V600 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway reactivation leads to resistance to vemurafenib in BRAF-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and that combined RAF and EGFR inhibition can lead to sustained MAPK pathway suppression and improved efficacy in vitro and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts </plain></SENT>
