<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinicopathological and follow-up data were collected from 174 surgical patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impact of LNR and clinicopathological factors on DFS and OS were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 62.5 months, the 5-year DFS and OS of the patients were 51.8% and 56.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median number of lymph nodes harvested and the median number of positive lymph nodes examined were 10 and 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were stratified into 4 groups according to LNR quartiles (LNR1, LNR≤0.125; LNR2, 0.125&lt;LNR≤0.260; LNR3, 0.260&lt;LNR≤0.500; LNR4, LNR&gt;0.500), whose 5-year DFS and OS were 64.2%, 53.5%, 41.8%, and 25.7% (P&lt;0.05) and 68.1%, 60.8%, 49.2%, and 32.7% (P&lt;0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified age, T stage and LNR as the independent predictors of both DFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis showed that LNR had an independent prognostic value on DFS and OS irrespective of the number of lymph nodes harvested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LNR is an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> and is superior to the pN category in TNM staging </plain></SENT>
