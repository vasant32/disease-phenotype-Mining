<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify associations between relevant risk factors and the uptake of screening in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Health Interview Survey sub-dataset derived from the Fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES IV) was used to evaluate participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and factors associated with attendance in individuals aged ≥50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those that completed the questionnaire and not previously diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were enrolled (8,042 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multi-dimensional covariates were considered as potential predictors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 33.2% complied with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following were associated with participation: age (aged 70 or older [ref], aged 70 or over; odds ratio (OR) 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-2.14), marital status (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.23-1.66), urban-dwelling (OR 1.16, 95%CI 1.02-1.32), education level (elementary school or less [ref], high school (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.09-1.53), university or higher (OR 1.53, 95%CI 1.23-1.91)), household income (fourth quartile [ref], first quartile (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.07-1.56)), private health insurance (OR 1.38, 95%CI 1.21-1.58), smoking (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.43-1.60), self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (OR 0.79, 95%CI 0.68-0.92), and number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases (0-3 [ref], ≥4 (OR 1.41, 95%CI 1.22-1.62)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To improve participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, appropriate strategies must be directed toward vulnerable populations, such as those with low socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
