<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that conductin levels peak at G2/M followed by a rapid decline during return to G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In line with this, Wnt/β-catenin target genes are low at G2/M and high at G1/S, and β-catenin phosphorylation oscillates during the cell cycle in a conductin-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conductin is degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome cofactor CDC20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of CDC20 blocks Wnt signalling through conductin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CDC20-resistant conductin inhibits Wnt signalling and attenuates colony formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that CDC20-mediated degradation of conductin regulates Wnt/β-catenin signalling for maximal activity during G1/S </plain></SENT>
