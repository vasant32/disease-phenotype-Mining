<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a series of focus groups with individuals recruited from a clinic that follows those at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary cancer</z:e>, individuals recruited from the community, physicians, and genetic counselors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were presented with clinical scenarios about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> testing and asked to identify characteristics that they perceived as important in making decisions about GT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two participants (19 community members, 8 high-risk and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, 3 genetic counselors, and 8 physicians) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among community members and patients, the most frequently discussed considerations were the personal impact of GT and family impact, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among physicians, the most frequently discussed topic was the characteristics of genomic services (e.g., test invasiveness); among genetic counselors, the most frequently discussed topic was evidence and recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A variety of test characteristics were important in decision making about GT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-risk patients, community members, and health care providers had different priorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Health care professionals should be aware of differences between their own considerations about GT and those that are important to patients </plain></SENT>
