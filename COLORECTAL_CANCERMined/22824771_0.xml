<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIM: To evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and CD34 in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, and to correlate this expression with different clinicopathologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was retrospectively designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 86 tissue samples, including 33 paraffin blocks from patients with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, 33 paraffin blocks from patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and a control group of 20 samples of nontumerous colonic tissue, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From each block, 3 sections of 5 μm thickness were taken, 1 section was stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H and E) and the other 2 sections were stained immunohistochemically for PCNA and CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scoring of the immunohistochemical staining was performed using a specified automated cellular image analysis system (Digimizer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PCNA expression was significantly increased in a sequence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was significantly higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> ≥ 1 cm and those with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and it showed a significant positive correlation with grade and lymph node involvement in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD34 showed significantly higher expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD34 expression showed a significant correlation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> carrying severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and large-sized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (≥1 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was significantly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node involvement in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PCNA plays an important role in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> and can be utilized as ancillary marker for the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> as it correlates with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intratumoral quantification of the mean (A and N) of CD34 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> reflects the grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and can predict lymph node involvement and lymphovascular invasion, to make a useful additional prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
