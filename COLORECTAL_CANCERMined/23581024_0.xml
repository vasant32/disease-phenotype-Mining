<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2009 to December 2011, 11 patients with 15 inoperable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were treated by SBRT using Varian Clinac iX linear accelerator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated 6 men and 5 women of age from 51 to 81 years (median 68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SBRT doses ranged from 40 to 56 Gy (median 54 Gy) and were administered in 3 to 8 fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local control rates at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months after completion of SBRT were 100%, 91%, 91%, 67% and 50%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease progression-free survival rates at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months were 82%, 82%, 64%, 50% and 50%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No severe side effects were attributed to the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study assessed the feasibility of SBRT in selected group of patients with 1 to 3 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> with no other treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We achieved excellent local control and very moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and late side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were the most common recurrence form after SBRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SBRT demonstrated excellent local control and resulted in occasional long-term survivors without any serious side effects of therapy </plain></SENT>
