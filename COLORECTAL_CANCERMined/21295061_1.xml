<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers and facilitators associated with participation in the first round of a population-based program for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in Catalonia, Spain and to identify strategies for motivating and supporting behavioral change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A two-part, mixed-methods design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In first place, a prospective study of individuals aged 50-69 years (n=1961) was conducted in 2006-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondly, focus groups were undertaken with participants and non-participants of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intention to participate was an important determinant of participation (82.9% vs 65.9%, OR=2.56, 95%CI:1.95-3.36) in addition to knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its early detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respondents who reported that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may be asymptomatic in early stages enrolled in the screening program more frequently than those who thought <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is always symptomatic (49.4% vs 44.8%, OR:1.82; 95%CI:1.3-2.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Barriers for participation mentioned in focus groups were competing perceived for other health problems and other demands as well as misunderstanding about personal relevance of the screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Individuals' perceptions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are amenable to change through education-based interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing public knowledge related to the burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its preventive potential may be an effective way for improving participation in a population-based screening program </plain></SENT>
