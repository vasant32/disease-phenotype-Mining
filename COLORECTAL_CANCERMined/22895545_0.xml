<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pontin and Reptin are ATPases which are involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair and regulation of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many interaction partners of Pontin and Reptin such as β-catenin and c-myc are important factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that Pontin and Reptin expression may be a negative predictor for survival in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specimens from 115 patients with primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinomas</z:mp> UICC stage III and primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinomas</z:mp> UICC stage II and III curatively resected at the Department of Surgery, Charité Berlin, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up data were complete and mean follow-up time of patients was 51.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the expression of Pontin, Reptin and Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with Pontin-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> showed no differences in recurrence-free survival (p=0.109) and overall survival (p=0.197) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in Reptin-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and Ki-67-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in recurrence-free survival (p=0.443 and p=0.160) and overall survival (p=0.477 and p=0.687) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with Pontin-positive colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> receiving adjuvant therapy had a significantly worse recurrence-free survival (p=0.008) and overall survival (p=0.011) than Pontin-negative patients with adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In UICC stage III, Pontin-positive colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> had a significantly worse recurrence-free survival (p=0.028) </plain></SENT>
