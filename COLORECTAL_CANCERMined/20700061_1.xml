<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Annexins (ANXAs) belong to a superfamily of closely related calcium and membrane-binding proteins and are overexpressed in some <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of ANXAs presumably induces an autoantibody response, but this has not been demonstrated for sera from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY: We examined serum samples from 220 CRC patients and 216 healthy volunteers to evaluate the ANXA autoantibody response in patients by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with recombinant ANXA A4 as the antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity of the anti-ANXA response from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient sera was about 85% and the specificity was about 61.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When a cut-off value of 5.0 ng/mL was chosen for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the same sera samples, the sensitivity and specificity values were 43.2% and 85.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined detection using ANXA autoantibodies and CEA produced better sensitivity (71.8%) and specificity (79.2%) compared with CEA sensitivity (43.2%) and anti-ANXA specificity (61.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area under a receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.794 for ANXA autoantibodies, 0.666 for CEA, and 0.84 for both markers together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in comparison to CEA (27.5% seropositivity), ANXA autoantibody showed a remarkable change (81.3% seropositivity) at the early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of ANXA autoantibody levels may provide an alternative detection indicator for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, particularly among early-stage patients </plain></SENT>
