<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Although advances in multimodal treatment have led to prolongation of survival in patients after resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-LM), most patients develop recurrence, which is often confined to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeat hepatic resection (RHR) may prolong survival or even provide cure in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the perioperative and long-term outcomes after RHR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-LM in a single institution series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1999, 92 repeat hepatic resections (63 % wedge/segmental, 37 % hemihepatectomy or greater) for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-LM were performed in 80 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median interval from initial liver resection to first RHR was 1.25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any kind of chemotherapy (CTx) had been given in 88 % before RHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant CTx was given in 38 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hepatic margin-negative resection was achieved in 79 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 3.8 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall complication rates were 53 %, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (17 %), operative re-intervention (12 %), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> (5.4 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall 5-year survival after first RHR was 50.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Univariately, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> stage, the extent of liver resection, postoperative complications, and the overall resection margin correlated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, primary T stage, size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and overall R0 resection influenced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival was not independently influenced by hepatic resection margins or (neoadjuvant) CTx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Repeat hepatic resection for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-LM can be performed with low mortality and acceptable morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Survival after repeat hepatic resection in this selected group of patients is encouraging and comparable to results after first liver resections </plain></SENT>
