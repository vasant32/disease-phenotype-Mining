<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a clinic-based individual randomized trial that enrolled Hispanic patients ages 50 to 79 years who had been seen in the Seattle-based community clinic in the past 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 501 patients met the eligibility criteria and were randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: 1) usual care; 2) mailed fecal occult blood test (FOBT) card and instructions on how to complete the test (mailed FOBT only); and 3) mailed FOBT card and instructions on how to complete the test, telephone reminders, and home visits (mailed FOBT and outreach) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed postintervention differences in rates of FOBT screening in intervention and usual care groups using computerized medical records reviewed from June 2007 to March 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data analysis occurred between November 2008 and September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine-month postintervention screening rates were 26% among patients who received the mailed packet only intervention (P &lt; .001 compared with usual care) and 31% in the group that received the mailed packet and outreach intervention (P &lt; .001 compared with usual care) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This compared with 2% in the group that received usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Screening rates in the mailed FOBT only group and in the mailed FOBT and outreach group were not significantly different (P = .28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Culturally appropriate clinic-based interventions may increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among underserved Hispanics </plain></SENT>
