<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have correlated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development with dietary habits and environmental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene signatures for any disease can identify the key biological processes, which is especially useful in studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such processes can be used to evaluate potential drug targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Though recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> gene-signatures across populations is crucial to better understanding potential novel treatment options for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, it remains a challenging task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We developed a topological and biological feature-based network approach for identifying the gene signatures across populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this work, we propose a novel approach of using cliques to understand the variability within population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cliques are more conserved and co-expressed, therefore allowing identification and comparison of cliques across a population which can help researchers study gene variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study was based on four publicly available expression datasets belonging to four different populations across the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We identified cliques of various sizes (0 to 7) across the four population networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cliques of size seven were further analyzed across populations for their commonality and uniqueness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine common cliques of size seven were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These cliques were further analyzed based on their connectivity profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We found associations between the cliques and their connectivity profiles across networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With these clique connectivity profiles (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCPs</z:chebi>), we were able to identify the divergence among the populations, important biological processes (cell cycle, signal transduction, and cell differentiation), and related gene pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore the genes identified in these cliques and their connectivity profiles can be defined as the gene-signatures across populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In this work we demonstrate the power and effectiveness of cliques to study <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> across populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new approach where cliques and their connectivity profiles helped elucidate the variation and similarity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> gene profiles across four populations with unique dietary habits </plain></SENT>
