<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biomarkers, it was generated and characterised several novel specific polyclonal antibodies (PAb), monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and soluble Fab fragments (sFabs) against recombinant CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins, which were obtained from different sources, including a human antibody library and immunised animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibodies and Fab fragments were tested for recognition of native CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins by immunoblotting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in colorectal cell lines derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both, antibodies and a Fab fragment showed high specificity since they recognised only their corresponding recombinant antigens, but not a panel of different unrelated- and related proteins.In Western blot analysis of CTHRC1, a monoclonal antibody designated CH21D7 was able to detect a band of the apparent molecular weight of a full-length CTHRC1 in the human <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line HT29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result was confirmed by a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) with the monoclonal antibodies CH21D7 and CH24G2, detecting CTHRC1 in HT29 and in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line SW620.Similar experiments were performed with PAb, MAbs, and sFab against NFE2L3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunoblot analysis showed that the monoclonal antibody 41HF8 recognised NFE2L3 in HT29, and leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were verified by DAS-ELISA assay using the pairs PAb/sFab E5 and MAb 41HF8/sFab E5.Furthermore, an immunoassay for simultaneous detection of the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biomarkers was developed using a Dissociation-Enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33319">Lanthanide</z:chebi> Fluorescent Immunoassay technology (DELFIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the antibodies obtained in this study are specific for CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 since they do not cross-react with unrelated- and related proteins and are useful for specific measurement of native CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antibodies and immunoassays may be useful for the analysis of CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 in clinical samples and for screening of therapeutic compounds in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
