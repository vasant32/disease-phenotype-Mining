<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search was performed on December 31, 2010 according to defined selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the correlation between MUC2 (detected by immunohistochemistry) and clinicopathological characters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histological type, differentiation, location and TNM staging of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, we divided the clinicopathological characteristics into different subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fixed and random effects models were applied for estimation of the summarized risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in different subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, forest plots and funnel plots were created to allow for visual comparison of the results or the effect of publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According with the inclusive criteria, fourteen studies (n=1,558) were eligible for the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed a trend towards a correlation of MUC2 higher positivity in mucinous than non-mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (RR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.30-3.40; P=0.002) and less positivity in distal than proximal colon (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.85; P=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significance for the association between MUC2 expression and differentiation or TNM staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but MUC2 overexpression tended to be associated with the presence of T stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (RR, 1.17; P=0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MUC2 overexpression was associated with the mucinous and proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
