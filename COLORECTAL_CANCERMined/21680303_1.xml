<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: FOLFOX (a combination of leucovorin, fluorouracil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) has achieved substantial success in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, about half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients show resistance to this regimen and some develop adverse symptoms such as neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to select patients who would benefit most from this therapy, we aimed to build a predictor for the response to FOLFOX using microarray gene expression profiles of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had metastatic or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and received modified FOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responders and nonresponders were determined according to the best observed response at the end of the first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene-expression profiles of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were determined using Human Genome GeneChip arrays U133 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified discriminating genes whose expression differed significantly between responders and nonresponders and then carried out supervised class prediction using the k-nearest-neighbour method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 27 probes that were differentially expressed between responders and nonresponders at significant levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the expression of these genes, we constructed a FOLFOX response predictor with an overall accuracy of 92.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 78.6%, 100%, 100% and 89.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present model suggests the possibility of selecting patients who would benefit from FOLFOX therapy both in the metastatic and the adjuvant setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a prediction model for the response to FOLFOX chemotherapy based on gene expression by microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
