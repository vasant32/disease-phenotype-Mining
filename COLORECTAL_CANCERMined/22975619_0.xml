<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether host hepatocytes may reverse hypoxic radioresistance through nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO)-induced oxygen sparing, in a model relevant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hepatocytes and a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells were incubated in a tissue-mimetic coculture system with diffusion-limited oxygenation, and oxygen levels were monitored by an oxygen-sensing fluorescence probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To activate endogenous NO production, cocultures were exposed to a cytokine mixture, and the expression of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and NO/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> targets of NO were examined by enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess hypoxic radioresponse, cocultures were irradiated and reseeded for colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resting hepatocytes consumed 10-40 times more oxygen than mouse CT26 and human DLD-1, HT29, HCT116, and SW480 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, and thus seemed to be the major effectors of hypoxic conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, hepatocytes caused uniform radioprotection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells at a 1:1 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, NO-producing hepatocytes radiosensitized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines more than 1.5-fold, similar to the effect of selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The radiosensitizing effect was associated with a respiratory self-arrest of hepatocytes at the level of aconitase and complex II, which resulted in profound reoxygenation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells through oxygen sparing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-producing hepatocytes were at least 10 times more active than NO-producing macrophages to reverse <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced radioresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hepatocytes were the major determinants of the hypoxic microenvironment and radioresponse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in our model of metabolic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that reoxygenation and radiosensitization of hypoxic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells can be achieved through oxygen sparing induced by endogenous NO production in host hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
