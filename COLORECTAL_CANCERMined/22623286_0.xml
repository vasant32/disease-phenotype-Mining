<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> on survival after surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred fifty-three patients who had undergone <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery were retrospectively identified from institutional database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, they were classified into two groups: group A, with a preoperative platelet count of ≤300 (×10(9) /L), and Group B, with a preoperative platelet count of &gt;300 (×10(9) /L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship to overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis and log rank test were used to compare the survival curves between groups A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference in overall survival between the two groups (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of selected preoperative clinicolaboratory characteristics showed that overall survival was associated with the platelet count (Group A/B) (odds ratio, 1.642; 95% CI, 1.025-2.629; P = 0.039) as well as the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (1/≥2), and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> is associated with survival after surgery in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and is able to divide such patients into two independent groups before surgery </plain></SENT>
