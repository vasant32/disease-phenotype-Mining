<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Japan, the cost-effectiveness of total colonoscopy (TCS) for primary screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the cost of identifying a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using two primary screening strategies: TCS (strategy 1) and the immunochemical fecal test (FIT) (strategy 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the TCS screening database at our institution from February 2004 to August 2010 (strategy 1, n = 15,348) and the Japanese nationwide survey of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in 2008 (strategy 2, n = 5,267,443) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>112 and 6,838 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were detected in strategies 1 and 2, costing 2,124,000 JPY and 1,629,000 JPY, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of earlier-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was higher in strategy 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cost was higher using TCS as a primary screening procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the difference was not excessive, and considering the increased rate of detecting earlier <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the use of TCS as a primary screening tool may be cost-effective </plain></SENT>
