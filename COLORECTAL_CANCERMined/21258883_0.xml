<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in CD1 genes have been suggested to modify ligand binding of CD1 molecules and thereby change the antigen presenting ability of these molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the exon 2 polymorphisms of CD1a and CD1d in several high incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, 201 female <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients and 207 healthy women, 64 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 95 healthy individuals and 109 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 109 healthy controls were recruited to this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using PCR-SSP method, no significant correlation was found in genotype and allele frequencies of CD1a between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three studied groups and their control counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a dominant frequency of CD1d 01 (A) allele was observed in the majority of studied individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant association between the CD1 polymorphisms and prognostic factors in breast, lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results highlight the conserved nature of CD1 genes and may point to the immuoregulatory functions of CD1 molecules in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> that can be exerted through fine tuning of NK, T and NKT cells </plain></SENT>
