<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proper migration involves the correct orientation of migrating neurons and the transition from a multipolar to a mature bipolar <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report that the 2 isoforms of Myosin-10 (Myo10) play distinct roles in the regulation of radial migration in the mouse cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that the full-length Myo10 (fMyo10) isoform is located in deeper layers of the cortex and is involved in establishing proper migration orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that fMyo10-dependent orientation of radial migration is mediated at least in part by the netrin-1 receptor deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we show that the headless Myo10 (hMyo10) isoform is required for the transition from multipolar to bipolar <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> in the intermediate zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study reveals divergent functions for the 2 Myo10 isoforms in controlling both the direction of migration and neuronal morphogenesis during radial cortical neuronal migration </plain></SENT>
