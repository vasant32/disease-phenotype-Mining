<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A growing body of evidence indicates that patients with sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> (SSA/P) and traditional serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (TSA) are at risk for subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite increasing knowledge on histological categorization of serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (SPs) data are lacking on the actual prevalence and the association of each SP subtype with advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively determined the prevalence of different SP subtypes and evaluate the association with synchronous advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in asymptomatic average-risk subjects undergoing first-time colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> retrieved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were examined by two independent pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serrated lesions were classified into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> (HP), SSA/P (without and with cytological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, SSA/P/DIS), and TSA, and were screened for BRAF and K-ras mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 258 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> detected in 985 subjects, the proportion of SSA/P and TSA was 8.9% and 1.9% with an overall prevalence of 2.3% and 0.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SSA/Ps were small without significant difference in their location between proximal and distal colon; TSA were predominantly left-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation was common in SSA/Ps and K-ras mutation was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were male sex (odds ratio (OR)=2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-4.0), increasing age (OR=4.5, 95% CI 1.5-13.4 for 50-69 years and OR=9.9, 95% CI 3.1-31.5 for &gt;70 years), current smoking (OR=2.0, 95% CI 1.3-6.8), &gt;3 tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (OR=3.6, 95% CI 1.9-6.4), and SSA/P (OR=6.0, 95% CI 1.9-19.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The substantial prevalence of BRAF-mutated SSA/P and the independent association with synchronous advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in asymptomatic average-risk subjects support the overall impact of the serrated pathway on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk in general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic characteristics of SSA/P emphasize the need of high-quality colonoscopy as a key factor for an effective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program </plain></SENT>
