<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: : Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> influenced by the duration, extent, and severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surveillance colonoscopy serves to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and precancerous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at the earliest possible time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> should theoretically reduce the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressives should do so, but there is a fear that indeed the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> might be increased with their use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study was conducted to determine whether a relationship exists between receiving treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> for ulcerative and Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and increasing or decreasing the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients with long standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (ulcerative and Crohn's) using the database of the senior investigator (B.I.K.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two groups were matched based on their propensity to receive treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi>; one group received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> treatment, the other did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both groups were compared on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : No significant differences existed between the two cohorts with regard to type of disease, duration, extent, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six out of 27 patients not on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> and seven out of 27 patients on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P= 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : We conclude that there is neither sufficient evidence currently to state that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> is associated with an increased development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, nor that it has a chemopreventive effect </plain></SENT>
