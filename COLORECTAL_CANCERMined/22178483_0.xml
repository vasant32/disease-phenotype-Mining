<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical syndrome of frailty identified through the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, gait speed, grip strength, physical activity, and physical exhaustion has been used to identify patients with reduced reserves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that frailty is useful in predicting adverse outcomes in optimized elective elderly colorectal surgery patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study was conducted at 2 centers (Singapore and Japan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients over 75 years of age undergoing colorectal resection were assessed for the presence of the syndrome of frailty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients had already had their comorbidities optimized for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome measure was postoperative major complications (defined as Clavien-Dindo type II and above complications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-three patients were studied from February 2008 to April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 81.5 years (range 75-93 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean comorbidity index was 3.37 (range 0-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six (31.3%) patients were an American Society of Anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) score of 3 and above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chi-square analysis revealed that the odds ratio of postoperative major complications was 4.083 (95% confidence interval, 1.433-11.638) when the patient satisfied the criteria for frailty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Albumin &lt;35, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> &gt;3, comorbidity index &gt;5, and Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity (POSSUM) scores were not predictive of postoperative major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings show that frailty is a potent adjunctive tool of predicting postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Frailty can be used to identify elderly patients needing further optimization before major surgery </plain></SENT>
