<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze differences in the therapeutic approach to and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related mortality of young and elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a descriptive study of a retrospective cohort, based on administrative databases, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed or treated in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We extracted data on sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidity, type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, type of treatment received, survival time, and cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared differences between a young group (YG) (age &lt;75 years) and an older group (OG) (age â‰¥75 years) and assessed the variables associated with receiving different therapeutic options (multivariate analysis) and with survival time (Cox proportional hazards models) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 503 patients (YG, 320; OG, 183), with mean ages of 63.1 years in the YG and 81.8 years in the OG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between the groups in degree of differentiation, extension, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, or comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for gender, comorbidity, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization and extension, YG patients were more likely than OG patients to receive surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy and less likely to receive palliative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 36.5 months, YG patients had a longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific survival time than OG patients (36.41 months vs 26.05 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment, the YG had a lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific mortality risk (hazard ratio, 0.66) than the OG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In comparison with younger patients, elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients are undertreated, mainly because of their age and not because of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type or comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients have a significantly shorter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific survival time, partially because of this undertreatment </plain></SENT>
