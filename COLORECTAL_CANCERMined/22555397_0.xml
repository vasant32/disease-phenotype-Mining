<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to provide detailed analysis of recent developments in survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients using newly available data on a national basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included data from 11 German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries covering a population of 33 million inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Period analysis and modelled period analysis were used to provide most up-to-date estimates of 5-year relative survival in 2002-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis was based on records of 164 996 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year relative survival was 63.0% overall, decreased with age and was significantly higher among women than among men in patients under 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall age-adjusted 5-year relative survival increased from 60.6 to 65.0% over the period 2002-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant increase in survival was only observed in patients with localised or regional disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Highest subsite-specific survival was observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in descending (67.7%) and ascending (66.5%) colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> continued to increase in the early 21st century in Germany, with 5-year relative survival reaching 65% in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, lack of progress still persisted in patients with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
