<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms of gene inactivation have been described; in this study we have focused on p16 gene promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> p16 gene methylation is a frequent event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 326 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue samples obtained during the surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation was analyzed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> modification and was detected by quantitative methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of p16 methylation was analyzed and compared with other clinicopathological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p16 gene methylation was detected in 24.8% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Methylation was associated with differentiation grade and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location: methylation was frequent in poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and had low frequency in distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The p16 promoter methylation discriminated a subgroup of patients with better prognosis in poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p16 methylation was a frequent event in our population and was able to induce differences in the overall survival of patients with poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
