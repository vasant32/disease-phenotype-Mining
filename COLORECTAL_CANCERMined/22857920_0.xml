<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of correlative imaging methods to dissect the cell's internal structure is progressing faster than ever as shown by the boom in the number of methodological approaches available for correlative microscopy studies, each designed to address a specific scientific question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this chapter, we will present a relatively straightforward approach to combining information from fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy at the supramolecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method combines live-cell and/or confocal laser microscopy with classical sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thereby allowing the integration of dynamic details of subcellular processes with insights about the organelles and molecular machinery involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We illustrate the applicability of this multidimensional correlative microscopy approach on cultured Caco-2 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells exposed to fluorescently labeled <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, and discuss how these methods can deepen our understanding of key cellular processes, such as drug uptake and cell fate </plain></SENT>
