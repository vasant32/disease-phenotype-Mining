<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a key component of the sporozoite stage of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> parasite, was recently reported to block NF-κB activation in hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated the effect of the CSP on the growth of the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line, SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that transfection with a recombinant plasmid expressing CSP inhibited the proliferation of SW480 in a dose-dependent manner and induced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A NF-κB gene reporter assay showed that both the CSP and its nuclear localization signal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e>) motif could equally suppress the activation of NF-κB following the stimulation with human recombinant TNF-α in the SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e> did not affect the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, but could sharply inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in TNF-α stimulated SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, our data suggest that the CSP might be explored as a new NF-κB inhibitor for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
