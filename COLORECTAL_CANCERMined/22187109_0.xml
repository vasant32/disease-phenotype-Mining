<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used a prospective, cross-sectional design with convenience sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An educational session on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) was provided to the participants during a health fair, and each participant was offered a no-cost FOBT kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data was collected over two consecutive years during three different health fairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was used to collect demographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 113 participants were recruited and 72% of them returned the FOBT kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between having a primary-care physician (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) and having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> in the past, even after controlling for age, gender and the length of time in the US (P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants who visited a doctor for health maintenance were less likely to participate in the FOBT, compared to participants who never visited a doctor or who only visited a doctor when they were sick (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The length of time in the US had a significant effect on having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> or having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> in the past was not associated with participating in the screening and so was feeling at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In fact, 49% of Chinese women and 45% of Chinese men felt no risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future research and interventions that address knowledge deficits and focus on recent immigrants and their access to health care may have the potential to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> among Chinese American immigrants </plain></SENT>
