<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of lymphatics in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> is, however, controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lymphatic patterns of CRLM were determined using a well established murine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CRLM were induced using a well established murine intrasplenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were assessed at varying stages of development, and lymphatic patterns were determined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and liver by immunohistochemistry staining for podoplanin and LYVE-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood vessels were characterized using the vascular marker CD-34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assessment was undertaken using digital microscopy and image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peri- and intratumoral lymphatic vessels were identified by podoplanin staining in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and significantly increased with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LYVE-1 staining was also noted but was variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a concurrent significant increase in portal lymphatic staining within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver with increasing growth of CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is increased expression of lymphatics within CRLM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver with increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lymphatic development is likely to play a significant role in the intrahepatic and periportal dissemination of CRLM </plain></SENT>
