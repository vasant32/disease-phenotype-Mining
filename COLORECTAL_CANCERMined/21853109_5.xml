<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MLL3 is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> 3-lysine 4 methyltransferase with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor properties that belongs to a family of chromatin regulator genes potentially altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in MLL3 were found in a whole genome analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> but have not been confirmed by a separate study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed mutations of coding region and promoter methylation in MLL3 using 126 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found two isoforms of MLL3 and DNA sequencing revealed frameshift and other mutations affecting both isoforms of MLL3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and 19 of 134 (14%) primary colorectal samples analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, frameshift mutations were more common in cases with microsatellite instability (31%) both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The largest isoform of MLL3 is transcribed from a CpG island-associated promoter that has highly homology with a pseudo-gene on chromosome 22 (psiTPTE22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using an assay which measured both loci simultaneously we found prominent age related methylation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon (from 21% in individuals less than 25 years old to 56% in individuals older than 70, R = 0.88, p&lt;0.001) and frequent hypermethylation (83%) in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We next studied the two loci separately and found that age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> related methylation was solely a property of the pseudogene CpG island and that the MLL3 loci was unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that frameshift mutations of MLL3 in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> that were more common in cases with microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we have shown CpG island-associated promoter of MLL3 gene has no DNA methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells but also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon, and this region has a highly homologous of pseudo gene (psiTPTE22) that was age relate DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
