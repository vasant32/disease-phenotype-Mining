<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of the intestinal specific transcription factor CDX2 is found to be transiently decreased in invasive cells at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>/stroma interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recent ChIP-Seq study has indicated that several Wnt signaling-related genes are regulated by CDX2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate the role of decreased CDX2 level on the expression of APC, AXIN2 and GSK3β in migrating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells at the invasive front </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CDX2-bound promoter and enhancer regions from APC, AXIN2 and GSK3β were analyzed for gene regulatory activity and the expression pattern of APC and GSK3β at the invasive front was evaluated by immunohistochemical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfection of intestinal and non-intestinal cell lines demonstrated that CDX2 activated APC and AXIN2 promoter activities via intestinal cell-specific enhancer elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suppressed CDX2 expression was associated with endogenous downregulation of APC and AXIN2 expression in Caco-2 cells but did not affect GSK3β expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, elevated levels of nuclear β-catenin and reduced levels of cytoplasmic APC were correlated to a low CDX2 expression in migrating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a low CDX2 level has influence on the Wnt signaling in invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells possibly promoting cellular migration </plain></SENT>
