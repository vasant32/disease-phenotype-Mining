<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the behavior, characteristics, and prognosis of this disease in young patients are unclear when compared to the older population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is believed that young patients have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that young patients have a poor prognosis because they have advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with more aggressive pathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a university hospital database, we analyzed the histopathological features of three groups of patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>: young age group (patients 40 years and younger), intermediate age group (patients 41-80 years old), and old age group (patients 81 years and older) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 653 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The young age group comprised 48 patients (7.4%), the intermediate age group comprised 538 patients (82.4%) and the old age group consisted of 67 patients (10.3%).The gender distribution was similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the young, intermediate, and old age groups were 34.5 (±5.0), 61.7 (±11.1) and 85.1 (±4.6) years old, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathological features analyzed such as lymph node involvement, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histological classification and grade, venous, neural and lymphatic invasion, T and N classification of the TNM System, and Astler-Coller classification were similar between the age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The colorectal histopathological features in young patients are similar to older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More aggressive characteristics or more advanced stage are not seen in younger patients </plain></SENT>
