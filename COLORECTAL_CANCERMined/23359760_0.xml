<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 11 loci that influence the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that these studies were conducted in European Caucasian populations, it is not clear whether the results are relevant for populations with different ethnicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine these associations in a southern Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs12701937, rs16892766, rs7014346, rs6983267, rs719725, rs10795668, rs3802842, rs4444235, rs9929218, rs10411210, and rs961253, were genotyped in 229 CRC patients and 267 controls using the MassArray SNP genotyping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evidence of an association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was found for four of the 11 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strongest associations were with rs4444235 and rs961253, with significant odds ratios close to those reported in previous GWAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these four loci, rs719725 and rs4444235 were significantly associated with female gender, rs3802842, rs961253, and rs4444235 with early disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and rs3802842 with later disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were detected for six other loci (rs9929218, rs10411210, rs12701937, rs7014346, rs6983267, and rs10795668), and one SNP, rs16892766, was not polymorphic in any of the study participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rs4444235 and rs961253 loci are strongly associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in southern Chinese </plain></SENT>
