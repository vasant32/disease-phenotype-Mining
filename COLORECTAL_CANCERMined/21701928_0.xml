<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survival outcomes for such patients have not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 1988-2007 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data were used to identify women diagnosed with both breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease-specific survival rates were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 4,835 women who were diagnosed with both breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 2,844 (58.8%) were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> first and 1,807 (37.4%) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> first; 184 (3.8%) had synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 5 years following the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> diagnosis, 163 (3.4%) died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and 477 (9.9%) died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing primary site groups between years 1 and 5 after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> diagnosis showed that the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> declined by 46%, though it did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.24), while it significantly increased by 46% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings persisted regardless of patient age, stage at diagnosis, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For women diagnosed with both breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the cumulative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 5 years following the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second cancer</z:e> diagnosis is 3 times more likely to be due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> than to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> specific mortality increases with time, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> specific mortality decreases with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consideration should be given to these findings when discussing prognosis and making treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
