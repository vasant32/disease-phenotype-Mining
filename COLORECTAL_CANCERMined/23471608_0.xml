<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective cohort analysis of linked data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A population-based sample of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients diagnosed from August 2004 to December 2007 in New South Wales, Australia, using the 45 and Up Study, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry diagnosis records, inpatient hospital records and Medicare claims records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 407 CRC patients who had a colonoscopy followed by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patterns of GP consultations between colonoscopy and surgery (ie, between diagnosis and treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether consulting a GP presurgery was associated with time to surgery, postsurgical GP consultations or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> cases having surgery in a centre with radiotherapy facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 407 patients, 43% (n=175) had at least one GP consultation between colonoscopy and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time from colonoscopy to surgery was 27 days for those with an intervening GP consultation and 15 days for those without the consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>55% (n=223) had a GP consultation up to 30 days postsurgery; it was more common in cases of patients who consulted a GP presurgery than for those who did not (65% and 47%, respectively, adjusted OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.50 to 4.89, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 142 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases, 23% (n=33) had their surgery in a centre with radiotherapy facilities, with no difference between those who did and did not consult a GP presurgery (21% and 25% respectively, adjusted OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.63, p=0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Consulting a GP between colonoscopy and surgery was associated with a longer interval between diagnosis and treatment, and with further GP consultations postsurgery, but for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> cases it was not associated with treatment in a centre with radiotherapy facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GPs might require a more defined and systematic approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> management </plain></SENT>
