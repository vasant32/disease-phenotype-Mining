<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Recently, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>) theory has been proposed, and CD133 has been suggested as a potential marker of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we aimed evaluate CD133 as a potential marker of colorectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> and, for this purpose, isolated CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells from a single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line, and compared their features, especially related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-forming and differentiation abilities, and the sensitivity to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: CD133(+) cells had higher in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-forming ability than CD133(-) cells, and in culture, they progressively differentiated into CD133(-) cells, but not vice-versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, CD133(-) cells were more resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (FU) treatment than CD133(+) cells, and it was found to be dependent on the higher expression of ß1-integrins, and consequently, higher ability to bind collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disruption of the ß1-integrin function abrogated the chemoresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From the present results, we concluded that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> CD133(+) cells, although showing some features of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>, are not more resistant to 5-FU than CD133(-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, definite conclusions can not be drawn yet, but it is strongly suggestive that CD133 should not be used as a single <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
