<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The increasing cost of chemotherapy is placing greater pressures on limited healthcare budgets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A potentially important, but often overlooked, aspect of chemotherapy is the cost associated with administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to develop a better understanding of these costs, and in doing so, develop a model to estimate the comparative cost of administering alternative chemotherapy protocols for economic evaluation or local decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified the potential tasks and choices related to administering intravenous chemotherapy, grouped tasks according to anticipated resource use, and allocated costs to each task using data from an evidence-based collection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> protocols or from primary data collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resources were costed from a healthcare system perspective using standard data sources within Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model was applied to alternative protocols used in the treatment of three different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>: locally advanced and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e>, adjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and adjuvant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: For the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types examined, the cost of completed administration ranged from 1274 Australian dollars ($A) to $A3015 (year 2009 values) for 13 different protocols potentially used for the initial treatment of locally advanced and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e>; $A5175-8445 for seven protocols for adjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treatment; and $A1494-4074 for seven protocols for adjuvant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results are of practical significance to those undertaking economic evaluations and to decision makers who use this information within the area of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The examples used suggest that administration costs per visit varied inversely with the number of visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results provide information where little has previously been available and may allow decisions about costs and resource allocation to be made with more certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although our model uses costs from the public health system within an Australian state (New South Wales), it can be adapted for use in other jurisdictions </plain></SENT>
