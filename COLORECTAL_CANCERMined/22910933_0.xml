<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies have identified characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> detected on colonoscopy to be predictive of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of both colonoscopy-related factors and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> characteristics on the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after colonoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population-based case-control study (3148 case participants and 3274 control participants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Rhine-Neckar region of Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Case and control participants with physician-validated detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (other than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath>) at a previous colonoscopy in the past 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Detailed history and results of previous colonoscopies were obtained through interviews and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Case and control participants were compared according to colonoscopy-related factors (incompleteness, poor bowel preparation, incomplete removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and no surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> characteristics (≥ 1 cm, villous components or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, ≥ 3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and ≥ 1 proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and attributable fractions were derived by using multiple logistic regression and the Levin formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 155 case participants and 260 control participants with physician-validated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection in the past 10 years were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The following characteristics were significantly more common among case participants than among control participants: not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> completely removed (29.0% vs. 9.6%; OR, 3.73 [95% CI, 2.11 to 6.60]), no surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years (26.5% vs. 11.5%; OR, 2.96 [CI, 1.70 to 5.16]), and detection of 3 or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (14.2% vs. 7.3%; OR, 2.21 [CI, 1.07 to 4.54]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios ranged from 1.12 to 1.42 and CIs included 1.00 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, 41.1% and 21.7% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases were statistically attributable to colonoscopy-related factors and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> characteristics, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: This was an observational study with potential for residual confounding and selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy-related factors are more important than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> characteristics for stratification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk after colonoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection in the community setting </plain></SENT>
