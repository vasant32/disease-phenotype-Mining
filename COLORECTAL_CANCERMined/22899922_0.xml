<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with FAP often undergo colectomy and are recommended to follow several surveillance protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biological relatives of persons with FAP may also be at risk and thus should undergo genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening adherence, genetic testing, and other health behaviors among individuals with FAP and their relatives are not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a cross-sectional self-report survey with individuals who have FAP (n = 35) and their biological relatives (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respondents were recruited through a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center registry for inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most relatives had undergone <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening; 40% had undergone genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One fifth of respondents with FAP had not undergone an upper endoscopy, contrary to usual recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking rates were above average and were higher among FAP respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of vitamin supplements was fairly common, more so among those with FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although most people had been screened, there are areas for improvement, notably for upper endoscopy among individuals with FAP and genetic testing among family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several other health-risk behaviors and health concerns other than FAP were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research into factors contributing to screening rates and other health behaviors in this high-risk population is warranted </plain></SENT>
