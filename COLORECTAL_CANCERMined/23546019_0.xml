<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan is a major anticancer agent specifically targeting DNA topoisomerase I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its cytotoxicity is mediated via a two-step process involving accumulation of reversible DNA‑topoisomerase I complexes associated with transient DNA single-strand breaks which subsequently are converted into permanent DNA double-strand breaks by the replication fork during S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan may be selectively active for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> that show microsatellite instability (MSI) due to deficiencies in mismatch repair enzymes, compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that are microsatellite stable but show chromosome instability (CIN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical activity of irinotecan is principally limited by acquired drug resistance, surprisingly little is known about the influence of prolonged irinotecan exposure on the cell cycle dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have developed two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines resistant to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, one derived from HT-29 (CIN), the other from HCT-116 (MSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We here show that besides classical resistance mechanisms, SN-38 resistance is accompanied by an increased generation doubling time, a decreased S phase fraction and an increased G2 fraction in vitro as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts for both CIN and MSI models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, SN-38-resistant cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> show cross-resistance to the S-phase selective agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resistance is accompanied by increased basal levels of γ-H2AX and phospho-Chk2 without notable changes in the levels of phospho-Chk1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results show that prolonged irinotecan exposure is accompanied by stable modifications of cell cycle dynamics which could have profound impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sensitivity to a wide range of antitumor agents and may influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in patients </plain></SENT>
