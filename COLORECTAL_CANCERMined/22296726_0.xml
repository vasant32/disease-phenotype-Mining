<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes represent potent effector cells of the adaptive immune response against viruses as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore assays capable at exploring the generation and function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes represent an important objective for both clinical and experimental settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here we show a simple and reproducible assay for the evaluation of antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes based on a LysiSpot technique for the simultaneous determination of antigen-specific IFN-γ production and assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cytolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assay was developed within an experimental model of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, induced by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> cell line <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DHD</z:e>-K12 that induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in BDIX rats and, in turn, elicits a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>- specific immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DHD</z:e>-K12 cells transfected to express Escherichia coli β-galactosidase as target cells, and by the fine setting of spot colours detection, we have developed an in vitro assay that allows the recognition of cytotoxic T lymphocytes induced in BDIX rats as well as the assessment of anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method highlighted that in the present experimental model the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> antigen-specific immune response was bound to killing target cells in the proportion of 55%, while 45% of activated cells were not cytotoxic but released IFN-γ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover in this model by an ELISPOT assay we demonstrated the specific recognition of a nonapeptide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> called CSH-275 constitutionally express in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DHD</z:e>-K12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The assay proved to be highly sensitive and specific, detecting even low frequencies of cytotoxic/activated cells and providing the evaluation of cytokine-expressing T cells as well as the extent of cytotoxicity against the target cells as independent functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This assay may represent an important tool to be adopted in experimental settings including the development of vaccines or immune therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
