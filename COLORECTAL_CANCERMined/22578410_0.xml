<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LAPTM4B expression was evaluated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between LAPTM4B expression and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 136 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 51 patients had low LAPTM4B expression, and 85 patients had high LAPTM4B expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of LAPTM4B overexpression were 62.5% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for patients with high and low LAPTM4B expression were 37.38% and 98.04%, respectively (hazard ratio = 22.774; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.287-98.091; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 21.15% for patients in the high-expression group and 91.82% for patients in the low-expression group (hazard ratio = 11.674; 95% CI, 3.562-38.263; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LAPTM4B overexpression is an independent factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prognosis, and it may be an important potential biomarker </plain></SENT>
