<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to improve patient compliance, a solid dosage form for oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was prepared as nano-sized particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Nano <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was prepared employing Fat Employing Supercritical Nano System (FESNS(®)) with Supercritical Fluid (SCF) apparatus by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25457">myristyl</z:chebi> alcohol as solvent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp> of nano <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>), and the particle size and zeta potential were confirmed with Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To characterize the nano <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> particles, solubility rate and in vitro efficacy study (MTS growth inhibition assay) were investigated compared to crude <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: FESNS(®) provided reproducible nano <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> with high manufacturing yield (&gt; 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> images showed that the particle size distribution of nano <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> ranged between 20 and 400 nm with the medium particle sizes (d(50)) of about 164 nm determined by DLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pertaining to the long-term stability, no recrystallization of the nano <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was observed with negative zeta potential in the state of solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nano <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was completely dissolved within a couple of minutes in pH 4.0 and pH 6.8 buffer solutions while crude <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> took a couple of hours to go into solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In case of MTS growth inhibition assay, the average concentration required to inhibit 50% of cell growth (GI(50)) of nano <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was decreased by about 45% in comparison to the crude <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results lead us to conclude that nano <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> would have a great potential for the improvement of efficacy and toxicity in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treatment compared to the crude <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
