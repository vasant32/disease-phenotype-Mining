<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate whether the Glasgow prognostic score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e>) is useful for predicting the survival of patients after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> was calculated on the basis of admission data as follows: patients with both an increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level (&gt;1.0 mg/dL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminemia</z:hpo> (&lt;3.5 g/dL) were allocated a score of 2, and patients showing one or none of these abnormalities were allocated a score of 1 or 0, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 108 patients with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although multivariate analyses showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathology, subclass of stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> were associated with overall survival, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> could divide the patients into 3 independent groups showing significant differences in postoperative survival (P = .018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> is not only one of the most significant clinical characteristics associated with the overall survival of patients with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but also a useful indicator that is capable of dividing such patients into 3 independent groups before surgery </plain></SENT>
