<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soluble vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) stimulates EC chemotaxis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of MICR on blood levels of sVCAM-1 is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study's purpose was to determine plasma sVCAM-1 levels after MICR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples from 90 patients (26% rectal, 74% colon) were obtained preoperatively, on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 3, and at other points during the next 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The late samples were bundled into 7-day time blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>sVCAM-1 levels were determined in duplicate via ELISA and reported as ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Student's t test was used for data analysis (significance, P &lt; 0.008 after Bonferroni correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean incision length was 7.3 ± 3.1 cm, and the conversion rate was 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with preoperative (PreOp) levels (811.3 ± 233.2), the mean plasma sVCAM-1 level was significantly higher on POD 1 (905.7 ± 292.4, P &lt; 0.001) and POD 3 (977.7 ± 271.8, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Levels remained significantly elevated for the POD 7-13, POD 14-20, POD 21-27, and POD 28-67 time blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MICR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is associated with a persistent increase in plasma sVCAM-1 levels during the first month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This sustained increase may promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and stimulate the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> cells early after surgery </plain></SENT>
