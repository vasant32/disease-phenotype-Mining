<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the 2006 New Mexico Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, we compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among Hispanics and whites by gender to examine the influence of demographic, socioeconomic, preventive health, and clinical measures on the utilization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although we found no ethnic differences in the prevalence of current breast, cervical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, Hispanics were less likely to be current with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening than whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These differences were observed across a range of socioeconomic and other explanatory measures and in both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hispanics also had a higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related risk factors than whites, including inactivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and ranked lower for most socioeconomic measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for healthcare coverage, education, and income in logistic regression models eliminated the Hispanic-white differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among men, and substantially reduced but did not eliminate screening differences among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Innovative methods are needed to reach Hispanics to raise awareness of and participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because many <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors are potentially modifiable, appropriate cultural and linguistic interventions tailored to specific Hispanic subgroups and aimed at promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors may decrease ethnic disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
