<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) can benefit from chemotherapy, yet compliance in real-world practice is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, compliance and reasons for refusal of postoperative chemotherapy for elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and to provide corresponding strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinico-pathological and biochemical data of the chemotherapy group and chemo-refusing group were compared among 386 elderly patients (&gt;70 years old) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>226 patients received chemotherapy and 160 patients refused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of the subjective reasons for refusal was investigated using the elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients' chemo-refusal reason questionnaire (ECPCRRQ) prepared by the authors and a group of psychologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire is administrated by telephone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A predictive model for 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) was constructed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis, logistic and Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among stage III patients, receiving chemotherapy was associated with a significantly higher OS (68%) compared to those who refused ( OS 50%) (HR: 2.05, 95%CI: 1.12-3.77, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Chemo-refusal group had more female and elderly patients, significantly higher rate of severe complications, and lower body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up phone questionnaire analysis showed the doctors' uncertainty of chemotherapy benefit, economic difficulties, uncomfortable feeling, superstition of Traditional Chinese Medicine, concealing information and lack of social support were the main factors for elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients to decline chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The receipt of post-operative chemotherapy in elderly patients with resected stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was associated with a more favorable survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The low compliance rate (160/386) of postoperative chemotherapy was influenced by various subjective and objective factors </plain></SENT>
