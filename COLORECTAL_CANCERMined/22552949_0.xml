<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, modulation of glycan expression with drugs has promising therapeutic potential for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the in vitro anticancer activity of the N-glycan biosynthesis inhibitors (swainsonine and tunicamycin) in cells derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined whether these inhibitors are able to induce radiosensitization and toxicity when used in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> or irinotecan, two current anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that treatment with tunicamycin inhibits cellular mechanisms related to the malignant phenotype, such as anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent colony formation, migration and invasion, in undifferentiated HCT-116 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, whereas swainsonine only inhibits cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed that tunicamycin, but not swainsonine, caused radiosensitivity in HCT-116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the combination of swainsonine with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> or irinotecan enhanced their toxicity in HCT-116 cells, while the combination of tunicamycin with these drugs had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given these results, we suggest that the modulation of N-glycan biosynthesis appears to be a potential therapeutic tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment because inhibition of this process induced anticancer activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the inhibition of the N-glycan biosynthesis in combination with chemotherapic drugs is a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
