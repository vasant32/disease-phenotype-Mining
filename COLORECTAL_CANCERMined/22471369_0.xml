<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan is a second-line anticancer drug, but clinical treatment with irinotecan is limited due to its side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the possible synergistic anticancer effects of panaxadiol and irinotecan on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and explored the potential role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in their synergistic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: The combination of panaxadiol and irinotecan significantly enhanced antiproliferative effects in HCT-116 cells (P&lt;â€ƒ0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that combining irinotecan treatment with panaxadiol significantly increased the G1-phase fractions of cells, compared with irinotecan treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In apoptotic assays, the combination of panaxadiol and irinotecan significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells compared with irinotecan alone (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was observed after treating with panaxadiol and irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The synergistic apoptotic effects were supported by docking analysis, which demonstrated that panaxadiol and irinotecan bound two different chains of the caspase-3 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study suggested that caspase-3- and caspase-9-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may play an important role in the panaxadiol enhanced antiproliferative effects of irinotecan on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
