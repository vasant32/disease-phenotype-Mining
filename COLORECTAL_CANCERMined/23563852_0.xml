<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cecal wall implantation was performed in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice to subclone a highly liver metastatic human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> clone (SW1116-M) from SW1116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo and in vitro assays were adopted to confirm the proliferation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor metastasis</z:e> PCR microarrays were used to analyze the differential gene expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were confirmed further by real-time quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SW1116-M and SW1116-S5, two human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell clones with different metastatic potential, were subcloned from SW1116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SW1116-M, in vitro invasion, migration and in vivo metastatic potential were higher, and in vitro proliferation rate was lower than SW1116-S5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor metastasis</z:e> PCR microarray, 24 genes related to cell invading, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, cellular growth and differentiation were found with a twofold difference between SW1116-S5 and SW1116-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of these, including E-cadherins, MTSS1, TRAIL and TRPM1, were up-regulated; eight genes including cathepsin L, EphB2, HGF, MET, MCAM and RORÎ² were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have established a highly liver metastatic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> PCR microarray analysis identified a procedure of cellular differentiation and mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The colonization to from macrometastasis is not a switch from cell cycle arrest but a result of cell differentiation and MET </plain></SENT>
