<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 102 consecutive patients who underwent elective fast-track laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> surgery were analysed prospectively from the Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Database supplemented by data from the medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied in detail the nature and chronological order of postoperative morbidity and reason for prolonged stay (&gt; 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (25%) had one or more complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical complications occurred in 19 patients, while six patients had medical complications as the primary event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients underwent reoperation, three died, and eight were readmitted within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median length of stay was 5 days (range 2-42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postoperative morbidity remains a significant problem in the fast-track era, even in experienced surgical hands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that besides improvement of surgical technique further improvement of outcome lies in early recognition and proper treatment of complications and the perioperative optimization of organ function </plain></SENT>
