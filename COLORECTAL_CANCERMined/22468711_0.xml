<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ligands for EGFR were investigated: EGFR-L1 and -L2, bearing 6 and 13 amino acid residues, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and Pc-conjugates were shown to bind to EGFR using both theoretical (Autodock) and experimental (SPR) investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Pc-EGFR-L1 conjugates 5a and 5b efficiently targeted EGFR and were internalized, in part due to their cationic charge, whereas the uncharged Pc-EGFR-L2 conjugates 4b and 6a poorly targeted EGFR maybe due to their low aqueous solubility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> conjugates were nontoxic (IC(50) &gt; 100 Î¼M) to HT-29 cells, both in the dark and upon light activation (1 J/cm(2)) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>700 nm, 24 h after administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies show that Pc-EGFR-L1 conjugates are promising near-IR fluorescent contrast agents for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and potentially other EGFR overexpressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
