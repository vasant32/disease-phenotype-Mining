<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is presently not known if endoscopic surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> with a closed rectal stump after a subtotal colectomy is justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither is it clear which of these patients might be at increased risk for rectal stump <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the risk factors for rectal stump <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This investigation is a retrospective descriptive case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: This study was conducted at tertiary referral centers in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> cases associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> diagnosed between 1990 and 2006 were selected in a nationwide pathology archive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with rectal stump <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were selected from this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathology archive was also used to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> controls matched for referral center with a closed rectal stump after subtotal colectomy, but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up started at the date of subtotal colectomy with the formation of a rectal stump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Demographic and disease characteristics were collected at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for factors associated with the development of rectal stump <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with the use of univariate Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>End points were rectal stump <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, end of follow-up, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 12 patients with rectal stump <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and 18 matching controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed an association between rectal stump <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>, and disease duration until subtotal colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by its retrospective design, and, despite being the largest series to date, it still has a limited number of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for rectal stump <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in a closed rectal stump after subtotal colectomy were primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> and disease duration until subtotal colectomy </plain></SENT>
