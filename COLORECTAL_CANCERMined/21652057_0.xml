<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that α(1,6)fucosyltransferase (Enzyme class 2.4.1.68) activity and expression are increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, suggesting a role for this enzyme in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the possible impact of α(1,6)fucosyltransferase activity or expression on clinical outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients has never been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study was conducted to determine the value of α(1,6)fucosyltransferase as a prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>. α(1,6)Fucosyltransferase expression was analyzed using immunohistochemistry in 141 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and α(1,6)fucosyltransferase activity was determined in 39 tumors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complete standardized follow-up of patients was documented until the end of the observation period of 5 years or patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis demonstrated the absence of a correlation between enzyme activity and disease evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with moderate or strong α(1,6)fucosyltransferase expression, a significant decrease in the overall (P = .04) and disease-free (P = .03) survival rates was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, when local and distant disease recurrence were considered separately, enzyme expression was found to correlate with local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrences (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that α(1,6)fucosyltransferase expression has independent value for predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrences and, specifically, local recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that α(1,6)fucosyltransferase expression may be a good indicator of poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and, therefore, a helpful tool to choose the most effective treatment </plain></SENT>
