<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to describe the efficacy and tolerability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, in patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> treated with bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-seven patients with advanced or metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>, colorectal or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> receiving bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks) and chemotherapy were eligible for this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was measured at home twice daily according to international guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> 5 mg daily for grade â‰¥ 2 bevacizumab-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> 5 mg daily for de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (group A), and another 10 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> for exacerbation of previously existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was controlled within 7 days under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> in 23/26 (88.5%, 95%CI: 76.2-100) patients in group A, and 8/10 (80%, 95%CI: 55.2-100) patients in group B, with a favourable toxicity profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">Amlodipine</z:chebi> 5 mg daily appears safe and efficient for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in patients receiving bevacizumab at a dose-intensity of 2.5 mg/kg/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
