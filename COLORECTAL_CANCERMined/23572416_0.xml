<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MMR is a highly conserved pathway that recognizes and repairs polymerase misincorporation errors and nucleotide damage as well as functioning as a damage sensor that signals <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) that retains the mutant MMR allele and epigenetic silencing of MMR genes are associated with an increased mutation rate that drives <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> as well as microsatellite instability that is a hallmark of LS/HNPCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Understanding the biophysical functions of the MMR components is crucial to elucidating the role of MMR in human <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and determining the pathogenetic consequences of patients that present in the clinic with an uncharacterized variant of the MMR genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We summarize the historical association between LS/HNPCC and MMR, discuss the mechanism of the MMR and finally examine the functional analysis of MMR defects found in LS/HNPCC patients and their relationship with the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
