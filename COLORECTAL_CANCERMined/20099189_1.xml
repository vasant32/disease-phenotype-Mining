<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is rapidly increasing in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This trend has been suggested to be caused by an increasing fat intake as a result of the Westernized diet among Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether dietary instruction optimizing the fat energy ratio suppresses the recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects, 373 men and women, were the participants in a randomized clinical trial of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At entry, each participant completed a 3-consecutive-day food record on which dietary instruction was given to restrict fat energy ratio to 18-22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data obtained before and after the intervention were examined by cohort analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e>(s) at colonoscopy after 4 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrence of tumor</z:e> increased as the subjects reduced their fat intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lowest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence among the men was observed in the group with 23.8-26.4% fat energy ratio after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in men, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> decreased significantly as the intake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acids</z:chebi> per body weight increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For women, similar trends were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that extreme fat restriction is highly likely to promote the recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, which may be partly attributable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
