<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study whether combined detection of the methylation status of vimentin, sFRP1, and HPP1 gene can increase the positive methylation rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from 90 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 60 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath>, and 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted and the methylation status of vimentin, sFRP1, and HPP1 gene was detected by Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between clinicopathologic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and gene methylation was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The methylation rates of vimentin, sFRP1, and HPP1 were 66.7%, 68.9%, and 72.2% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 53.3%, 55.0%, and 50.0% in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and 0, 0, and 5.0% in healthy controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methylation of each of the three genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues was higher than colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and healthy controls(P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic sensitivity by combining three methylation markers was 93.3% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 76.7% in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, which was higher than the sensitivity using single gene testing(P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant associations existed between the methylation status of the three genes and clinical characteristics including sex, age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and TNM stage(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation levels of vimentin, sFRP1 and HPP1 are significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined detection significantly improves the positive rate of methylation, and may be used as early diagnosis method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
