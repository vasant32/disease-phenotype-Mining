<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Much of the contemporary debate in this area is regarding appropriate training of surgeons, as there is a steep learning curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arguably, the most difficult aspect of laparoscopic colon resection is mobilization of the transverse colon, with division of the middle colic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mobilizing the transverse colon is necessary for many colonic resections, including "introductory" procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our department has a consistent, sequential method for mobilization of the transverse colon with proximal isolation and ligation of the middle colic artery as indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This involves using the head, or distal body, of the pancreas as a landmark, for right-sided and left-sided resections, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that this particular methodology is easy to learn and surgically efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also discuss some particular intraoperative problems and scenarios, with suggested solutions </plain></SENT>
