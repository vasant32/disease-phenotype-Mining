<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colon capsule endoscopy seems to be a safe and effective method of visualizing the colonic mucosa without the need for sedation or insufflation of air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bowel cleansing for colon capsule endoscopy is more rigorous as only excellent or good results can be accepted in order to obtain an adequate sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This restricts its application on persons who are able to drink 4 l of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="35" ids="50503">laxatives</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
