<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: ERCC1, CD3EAP, and PPP1R13L polymorphisms in the chromosomal region 19q13.2-3 have already been shown to have a synergistic effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and DNA repair pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between such genetic variants and the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) following curative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was extracted from fresh frozen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue from 349 CRC patients underwent curative surgery and then genotyped for 5 polymorphisms (PPP1R13L rs1970764 and rs1005165; CD3EAP rs967591; ERCC1 rs735482 and rs11615) using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 5 polymorphisms, PPP1R13L rs1970764 was significantly associated with relapse-free (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in a recessive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In haplotype analysis, three haplotypes (TACC, CGAC, and CGAT) were selected for analysis among 6 haplotypes constructed by the PHASE II program using 4 polymorphisms (rs1005165, rs967591, rs735482, and rs11615) in a moderate to strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D' &gt; 0.4), and a significant difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> was observed among patients with these 3 haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, the GG genotype of PPP1R13L rs1970764 was identified as an independent prognostic factor for poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and DSS (HR = 1.743 and 1.734; P = 0.003 and 0.010, respectively) when compared with the combine AA/AG genotype adjusted to clinicopathologic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, the prognostic impact of PPP1R13L rs1970764 was persistent only in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (HR = 3.307 and 3.180; both P &lt; 0.001 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and DSS, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that the PPP1R13L rs1970764 variant is a possible prognostic marker for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
