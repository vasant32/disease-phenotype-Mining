<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: With an increasing elderly population, the United States will experience an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> burden in the coming years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated associations between anthropometric, lifestyle, and reproductive factors and risk of breast, ovarian, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a prospective study of postmenopausal women with a focus on diagnoses occurring among very elderly women (≥75 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type, we estimated associations with relevant exposures in 2 age bands (&lt;75 vs. ≥75 years of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During 22 years of follow-up, 322 ovarian, 1,311 colon, 315 rectal, and 2,664 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> occurred among 37,459 postmenopausal women (mean age at baseline 62 years, range 55-71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, we identified few significant associations in either age band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon cancer</z:hpo> cases had a higher body mass index and were less likely to report <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> or aspirin use than non-cases, yet these associations were consistent in both age bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Few risk factors were identified for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in women of 75 years of age or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, notably different patterns were revealed, with alcohol consumption associated with risk in the younger group and previous hysterectomy associated with risk only in the older group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These analyses suggest some important differences in risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> depending on the age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Impact: This study suggests that etiologic differences may exist in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> occurring in the very elderly women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ongoing demographic shift in the United States provides a strong rationale for studies evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> etiology in the elderly </plain></SENT>
