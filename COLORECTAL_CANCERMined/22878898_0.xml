<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interest in the possibility that diet might help to reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> dates back to 1970 based on both the large variation in rates of specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in different countries and the impressive changes observed in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in migrants from low- to high-risk areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the state of art of literature data about this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three sections have been separately considered: chemoprevention of first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, chemoprevention of recurrence after surgery, and chemoprevention of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> recurrence in the course of the follow-up of subjects with elevated risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A particular attention has been pointed to dietary factors and survival, whose relevance is showing a growing interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relationship between diet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has been extensively studied about the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, sometimes with controversial results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its influence on recurrence and survival has been examined in only few studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Literature data are convincing for a protective role on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions for some foods such as fibers, vitamin A and D, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, calcium, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, and promising perspectives for some substances such as phyto-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Less evidence-based data are available on the possibility to avoid the recurrence of the disease or to affect its mortality with dietary habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future perspectives will be directed be not only to identify new dietary style able to prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neoplastic lesion of the colon but also to realize an effective chemoprevention </plain></SENT>
