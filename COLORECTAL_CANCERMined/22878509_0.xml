<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated their frequency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>.Methods:A total of 416 individuals with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> showing loss of MLH1 expression and without deleterious germline mutations in MLH1 were ascertained from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> Family Registry (C-CFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Constitutive DNA samples were screened for MLH1 methylation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 416 subjects and for promoter sequence changes in 357 individuals.Results:Constitutional MLH1 epimutations were identified in 16 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, seven (1.7%) had mono- or hemi-allelic methylation and eight had low-level methylation (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one subject the epimutation was linked to the c.-27C&gt;A promoter variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Testing of 37 relatives from nine probands revealed paternal transmission of low-level methylation segregating with a c.+27G&gt;A variant in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five additional probands had a promoter variant without an MLH1 epimutation, with three showing diminished promoter activity in functional assays.Conclusion:Although rare, sequence changes in the regulatory region of MLH1 and aberrant methylation may alone or together predispose to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Screening for these changes is warranted in individuals who have a negative germline sequence screen of MLH1 and loss of MLH1 expression in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>.Genet Med 2013:15(1):25-35 </plain></SENT>
