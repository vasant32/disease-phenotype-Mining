<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for retrospective studies evaluating prognostic factors following resecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual patient data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Independent prognostic factors were used to construct an LMPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1983 and 2008, 1112 metastasectomies were carried out on 927 patients included in eight studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rate was 54.3% following the first lung resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified three independently poor prognostic factors: pre-thoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen â‰¥5 ng/ml, disease-free interval &lt;36 months, and more than one metastatic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with good-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups according to the LMPM had a 5-year survival of 68.2%, 46.4%, and 26.1%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perioperative chemotherapy and previously resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> had no influence on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The low- and intermediate-risk groups have a good chance of long-term survival following metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, more studies are needed to investigate whether surgery offers any advantage over systemic therapy for the poor-risk group </plain></SENT>
