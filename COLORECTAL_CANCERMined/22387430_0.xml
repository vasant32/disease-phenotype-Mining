<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because no prospective cohort studies have done so to date, the authors prospectively examined this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1992, eating frequency was assessed in a cohort of 34,968 US men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for various levels of eating frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effect modifications by overall dietary quality (assessed using the Diet Approaches to Stop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> score) and by factors that influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were further assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between 1992 and 2006, a total of 583 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When comparing the highest eating frequency category (5-8 times/day) with the reference category (3 times/day), the authors found no evidence of an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (multivariate relative risk = 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.62, 1.26) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (multivariate relative risk = 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.49, 1.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an implied inverse association with eating frequency among participants who had healthier diets (high Diet Approaches to Stop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> score; P for interaction = 0.01), especially among men in the high-insulin-sensitivity group (body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) &lt;25, â‰¥2 cups of coffee/day, and more physical activity; P for interaction &lt; 0.01, P for trend = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an implied protective association between increased eating frequency of healthy meals and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk and in men with factors associated with higher insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
