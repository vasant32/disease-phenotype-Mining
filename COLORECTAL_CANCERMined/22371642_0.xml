<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the protein expression profile of mismatch repair (MMR) genes in suspected cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> and to characterize the associated germline mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples was performed to determine the protein expression profile of MMR protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Germline mutation screening was carried out on peripheral blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The entire exon regions of MLH1 and MSH2 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, screened by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and analyzed by DNA sequencing to characterize the germline mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three out of 34 tissue samples (8.8%) and four out of 34 tissue samples (11.8%) showed loss of nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry, indicating the absence of MLH1 and MSH2 protein expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>dHPLC analysis followed by DNA sequencing showed these samples to have germline mutations of MSH2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no deleterious mutations were identified in any of the 19 exons or coding regions of MLH1 gene, but we were able to identify MLH1 promoter polymorphism, -93G &gt; A (rs1800734), in 21 out of 34 patients (61.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified one novel mutation, transversion mutation c.2005G &gt; C, which resulted in a missense mutation (Gly669Arg), a transversion mutation in exon 1, c.142G &gt; T, which resulted in a nonsense mutation (Glu48Stop) and splice-site mutation, c.2006-6T &gt; C, which was adjacent to exon 13 of MSH2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Germline mutations were identified in four Malaysian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue proved to be a good pre-screening test before proceeding to germline mutation analysis of DNA MMR genes </plain></SENT>
