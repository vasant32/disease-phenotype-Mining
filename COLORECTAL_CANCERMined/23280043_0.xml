<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a qualitative ethnographic study from a gender perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants consisted of men and women aged 50 to 69 years old in the Balearic Islands and Barcelona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group discussion and a field diary were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The key element was diagnosis at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Until recently, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was considered an incurable disease but is currently perceived as a serious health problem that can be cured if diagnosed promptly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The participants requested more information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and felt they were at risk, mainly because of their age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men tended to pay attention to symptoms while women tended to ignore them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Attitudes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening were generally positive, even to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some barriers to screening were identified in women, such as a fear of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The opportunity for early diagnosis is the key element in promoting participation in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perceptions-and hence willingness to participate in screening-differ between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Factors to be taken into account in the design of population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> programs are health concerns in men and fear of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis in women </plain></SENT>
