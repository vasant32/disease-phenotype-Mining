<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> associated macrophages (TAMs) play complex roles in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> since they are believed to hold both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> preventing (M1 macrophages) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoting (M2 macrophages) activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we have applied an immunohistochemical approach to determine the degree of infiltrating macrophages with a M1 or M2 phenotype in clinical specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in relation to prognosis, both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in general but also in subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> defined by microsatellite instability (MSI) screening status and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 485 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens were stained for nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase 2 (NOS2) (also denoted iNOS) as a marker for the M1 macrophage phenotype and the scavenger receptor CD163 as a marker for the M2 macrophage phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average infiltration of NOS2 and CD163 expressing macrophages along the invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> front was semi-quantitatively evaluated using a four-graded scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two subtypes of macrophages, displaying M1 (NOS2(+)) or M2 (CD163(+)) phenotypes, were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant correlation between the amount of NOS2(+) and CD163(+) cells (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strong inverse correlation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage was found for both NOS2 (P&lt;0.0001) and CD163 (P&lt;0.0001) infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients harbouring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> highly infiltrated by NOS2(+) cells had a significantly better prognosis than those infiltrated by few NOS2(+) cells, and this was found to be independent of MSI screening status and CIMP status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival in groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with different NOS2/CD163 ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, an increased infiltration of macrophages with a M1 phenotype at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> front is accompanied by a concomitant increase in macrophages with a M2 phenotype, and in a stage dependent manner correlated to a better prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
