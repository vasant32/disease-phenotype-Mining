<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These micronutrients have been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are, however, inconsistencies within the literature, with some studies showing restriction to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-inhibitory effects, whereas others suggest excess to have adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a review of the published data to examine the accumulated evidence for involvement of dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and/or methionine restriction or excess in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumour</z:e> development in the Apc(Min/+) mouse model, which is genetically prone to develop such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen publications were selected for evaluation based on the following inclusion criteria: (i) use of Apc(Min/+) mouse model; (ii) interventions using dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and/or methionine; and (iii) primary outcome measures focused on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumour</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that nutritional modulation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and methionine was shown to have different effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal cancer</z:e> in the Apc(Min/+) mouse, depending on the dosage, duration and timing of intervention, and interaction of the Apc(Min/+) genotype with other genetic factors affecting <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and DNA methylation metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although some studies showed that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency before <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> tended to increase risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> formation, there are inconsistencies regarding whether excess <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> post-weaning or after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598935" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour initiation</z:e> increases <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumour</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the pooled data do not appear to indicate a difference in effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumour</z:e> incidence between post-weaning diets that are <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficient or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> adequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Apc(Min/+) mouse is a useful model for assessment of the impact of dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumour</z:e> development, but further research is required to understand the reasons for these inconsistencies amongst studies based on likely mechanisms, including modulation of nucleotide synthesis, DNA methylation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp>, which may affect the rate of cellular division and its control </plain></SENT>
