<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: The anti-proliferation of SRI in human colorectal cells SW480 were detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi>(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential mechanism of anti-proliferation was also investigated using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> cells was detected also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23511,32460">cysteinyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> specific protease (caspase), caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-9, and poly-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>-poly-merase (PARP) were determined by western blotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In animal studies, <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice were subcutaneously injected with SW480 cells in the armpit to establish the xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and administrated with different drugs (control, 5-Fu, SRI H, and SRI L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The general state of health of the mice and the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were observed and the inhibitory rate was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathology and ultrastructure of xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> treated with SRI were observed also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: SRI significantly inhibited the growth of SW480 cells, and the administration of SRI significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> without apparent toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SRI's mechanism of action involved the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that SRI produces obvious anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effects in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It supports the viability of developing SRI as a novel therapeutic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment, as well as providing a method for identifying new anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> drugs in TCM </plain></SENT>
