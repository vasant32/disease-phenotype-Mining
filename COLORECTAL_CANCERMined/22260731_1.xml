<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A more appropriate definition of health was proposed since health maintenance is a dynamic process better assessed in terms of ability to adapt to stress and maintain physiological homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers specifically for health are needed; use of challenge models and subjects with suboptimal health or specific disease risk were advised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complexity of interactions between external factors, the intestinal epithelium, intestinal microbiota, the immune system and health was exemplified by describing the effects of antibiotics, the Western diet and non-digestible carbohydrates on the microbiota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of certain bacteria with different states of health or disease was acknowledged but also that is not always clear whether this is a cause or effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent identification of three robust faecal metagenome clusters may advance this understanding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was speculated that knowledge of the intestinal microbiota profile may eventually help in the diagnosis of health risks and choice of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was agreed that beneficial manipulation of the commensal microbiota can improve health outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, three areas were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Firstly, research into probiotics as vaccine adjuvants was considered useful for substantiation of immune function claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Secondly, positive results with certain probiotics and synbiotics for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are emerging, mostly from in vitro and animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, studies in endurance athletes have shown strain-specific probiotic benefit in terms of maintenance of immune function and, for certain strains, reduction of episodes of respiratory and/or gastrointestinal tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
