<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background Epidemiological studies have reported inconsistent associations between cruciferous vegetable (CV) intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the association between CV intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods Relevant articles were identified by searching MEDLINE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We pooled the relative risks (RR) from individual studies using a random-effect model and carried out <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and publication bias analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results Twenty-four case-control and 11 prospective studies were included in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies were pooled, we yielded a significantly inverse association between CV (RR: 0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.75-0.90) intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific analysis for cabbage and broccoli yielded similar result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When separately analyzed, case-control studies of CV intake yield similar results, and the results from the prospective studies showed borderline statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significant inverse associations were also observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and its distal subsite both among prospective and case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions Findings from this meta-analysis provide evidence that high intake of CV was inversely associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further analysis on other specific CV, food preparation methods, stratified results by anatomic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site, and subsite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> should be extended in future study </plain></SENT>
