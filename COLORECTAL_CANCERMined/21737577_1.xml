<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Systemic therapy has led to a median survival time for patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) almost fourfold longer than that expected with best supportive care, an outcome achieved through combining chemotherapeutic and targeted biologic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the latter can include anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, we now have strong evidence that patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> harbor mutated KRAS will not benefit from this class of agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acceptance of the reliability and importance of the KRAS data took several years to evolve, however, for a variety of reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The timeline from the presentation and publication of small, retrospective phase II studies to widespread acceptance of the KRAS predictive value and changes in behavior-specifically, modifications of ongoing national trials in advanced/metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, changes in national guidelines and practice patterns, and adjustments to the labeled indications for the monoclonal antibodies-was lengthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this commentary, we discuss whether or not the process of data disclosure regarding KRAS status and treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was effective in permitting timely decisions regarding ongoing publicly funded clinical trials and whether or not such decisions were rational and ethical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall goals are to highlight lessons learned regarding early disclosure of clinical trial results, as well as vetting and adoption of new scientific data, and to propose modifications for handling similar situations in the future </plain></SENT>
