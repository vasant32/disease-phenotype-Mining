<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded clinical samples represent a very diverse source of material for proteomic investigation of diseases, often with follow-up patient information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe an analytical workflow for analysis of laser-capture microdissected formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples that allows studying proteomes to a depth of 10 000 proteins per sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The workflow involves lysis of tissue in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-containing buffer, detergent removal, and consecutive digestion of the proteins with two enzymes by the multienzyme digestion filter-aided sample preparation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resulting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are fractionated by pipette-tip based strong <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> exchange into six fractions and analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a bench top quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of the data using the MaxQuant software resulted in the identification of 9502 ± 28 protein groups per a 110 nL sample of microdissected cells from human colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This depth of proteome analysis enables systemic insights into the organization of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> cells and an estimation of the abundances of known biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also allows the identification of proteins expressed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors, oncogenes, and other key players in the development and progression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our proteomic platform can be used for quantitative comparisons between samples representing different stages of diseases and thus can be applied to the discovery of biomarkers or drug targets </plain></SENT>
