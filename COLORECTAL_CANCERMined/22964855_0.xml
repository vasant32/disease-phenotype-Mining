<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell hypothesis are challenging because of the imperfect tools to identify cell populations of interest and controversy on the usefulness of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously found CD133 to not be selective for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-propagating or radioresistant population in a near-diploid, microsatellite-instable colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of discrepant literature data, we herein systematically analyzed the behavior of microsatellite-stable cell line subpopulations reflecting the more frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> pathway in spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD133⁺ and CD133(-/low) populations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and further processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HT29 and SW620 cells were studied in detail in monolayer and/or spheroid culture assays and upon subcutaneous injection in NMRI (nu/nu) mice using a limiting dilution approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD133(-/low) HT29 cells showed a significantly lower clonogenic survival and reduced spheroid formation capacity than their CD133⁺ counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the cell populations neither differed in growth kinetics and response to treatment in vitro nor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation capacity when injecting as low as 10 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD133(-/low) HT29 cells rapidly re-expressed CD133 protein in vitro and in vivo as shown by flow cytometry and/or western blot analyses, and they also showed a particular survival benefit under tissue normoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CD133 protein in the CD133⁺ population was quite stable throughout culturing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observation of CD133 re-expression and lack of difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> take rate of subpopulations was confirmed in SW620 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here, we found cell density to affect CD133 re-expression in the CD133(-)-sorted population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>And even SW480 cells, classified as a CD133⁻ cell line, presented some CD133 protein on their surface upon in vivo engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (i) CD133 protein expression shows high plasticity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, and (ii) in vitro CD133 status on the cell surface neither determines tumorigenic potential nor CD133 profile in vivo </plain></SENT>
