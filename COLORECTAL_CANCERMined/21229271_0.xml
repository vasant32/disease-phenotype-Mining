<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S-adenosylmethionine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi>) administration is effective in the treatment of a variety of liver injuries, but it has never been evaluated in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients were treated with bevacizumab and XELOX without administering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi>, 32 were treated with the same regimen plus supplementation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Liver enzymes levels were assessed before starting the treatment, and then every therapy cycle, liver toxicity, chemotherapy course delays, discontinuations, and dose reductions due to liver toxicity were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">Aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (P = 0.02), alanine transaminase (P &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (P = 0.008), total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (P = 0.03), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (P &lt; 0.001) were found to be significantly lower in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi> than in those who were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients supplemented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi> experimented a lower grade of liver toxicity (P = 0.009) and had a reduced need of course delay (P = 0.042) and dose reduction (P = 0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15414">AdoMet</z:chebi> supplementation in patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based regimen seems to be effective in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced liver injury </plain></SENT>
