<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is strongly recommended in average-risk population, compliance rates are still far from the desirable rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High levels of screening uptake are necessary for the success of any screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the investigation of factors influencing participation is crucial prior to design and launches a population-based organized screening campaign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several studies have identified screening behaviour factors related to potential participants, providers, or health care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These influencing factors can also be classified in non-modifiable (i.e., demographic factors, education, health insurance, or income) and modifiable factors (i.e., knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening, patient and provider attitudes or structural barriers for screening) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modifiable determinants are of great interest as they are plausible targets for interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interventions at different levels (patient, providers or health care system) have been tested across the studies with different results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This paper analyzes factors related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening behaviour and potential interventions designed to improve screening uptake </plain></SENT>
