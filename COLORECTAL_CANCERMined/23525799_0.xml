<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation carriers have a life-time risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) of between 25 and 75 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the importance of a centralized organization of surveillance was emphasized in the late 1980s, the number of registered LS families with a known mutation has increased enormously worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large-scale surveillance programs of these families have achieved a 62 % reduction in incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and a 65-70 % decrease in mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is still substantial even when included in a program and the most optimal surveillance interval for gene carriers remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, improvements in high quality colonoscopy and new endoscopic visualization techniques will further reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in those included in a surveillance program </plain></SENT>
