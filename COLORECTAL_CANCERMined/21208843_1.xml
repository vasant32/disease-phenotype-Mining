<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The bevacizumab-cetuximab combination has shown promising activity in chemotherapy-refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of cetuximab added to bevacizumab plus standard mFOLFOX6 (modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> [5-FU]/leucovorin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) as first-line therapy for mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients received cetuximab (400 mg/m2 loading dose, then 250 mg/m2 weekly intravenously [I.V.]) plus bevacizumab 5 mg/kg and mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common grade 3-4 events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (14%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (14%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (12%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (9%), acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (8%), and desquamation (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A protocol-defined prohibitive adverse event occurred in 4 patients (6%), including 2 treatment-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients (56%) discontinued therapy before disease progression because of either toxicity (n = 19; 29%) or patient withdrawal (n = 18; 27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight of 37 patients (76%) who discontinued therapy before disease progression did so because of cetuximab-associated toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the addition of cetuximab to bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 was not associated with excessive life-threatening toxicity, many patients discontinued therapy because of cetuximab-associated toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together with the results of recently reported phase III trials, cetuximab should not be used concurrently with bevacizumab and infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> chemotherapy for the treatment of mCRC </plain></SENT>
