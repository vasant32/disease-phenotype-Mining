<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The conventional FOLFOX4 was repeated every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We waited until the recovery of symptoms from persistent neurotoxicity within an added period of 2 weeks, before performing the next cycle ("wait and go" strategy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We enrolled 58 patients, in whom a total of 481 cycles were administered (median 8 per patient; range 1-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was evaluated in 58 patients and response in 55 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major toxic effect was grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> or persistent functional impairment was observed in 4 patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 40% (95% confidence interval; 27.1-52.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival time was 10.2 months, the 1-year survival rate was 89%, and the median overall survival time was 27.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that this "wait and go" strategy reduces the frequency of persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> while maintaining efficacy against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
