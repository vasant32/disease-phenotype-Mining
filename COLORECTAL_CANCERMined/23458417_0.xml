<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Burns is saying that mice and humans facing unforseen catastrophes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> have much in common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, whilst it is clear that there are some similarities between mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as seen in the clinic, the artificial conditions presented by animal models are very different to those found in humans with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It cannot be assumed that even basic pathophysiologic processes found in animal models are anything more than a model (literally a 'likeness') of similar processes found in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With these caveats, Barone et al's paper published in this edition of Colorectal Disease (REF1) provides important insights into the pathophysiology of cytokeratin positive cells in the bone marrow of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>. © 2013 The Authors </plain></SENT>
