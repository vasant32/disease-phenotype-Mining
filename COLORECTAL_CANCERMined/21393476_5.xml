<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of 1016 pairs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients and matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free controls, we investigated two genetic polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the c-Jun (rs4646999, -673C &gt; T and rs2760501, -1318T &gt; G) via the Taqman assay and evaluated the association between two polymorphisms and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that both the -1318G and -673C variant genotypes were associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> [-1318TG: odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.54; -1318GG: OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.03-2.60; -673CT: OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.23-2.07; -673CC: OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.36-2.37] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Haplotype association analysis showed that compared with the carriers of -1318T-673T haplotype, carriers of the -1318T-673C, -1318G-673T, and -1318G-673C haplotypes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combined genotypes incorporating both polymorphisms obtained a more significantly additive risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (one variant genotype: OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.30-2.51; two variant genotype: OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.70-3.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that the change of the -1318T to G allele interact with the -673T to C allele elevated the transcription activity of the c-Jun, and we confirmed the same trends by analyzing c-Jun protein expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues from patients carrying different number of variant genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that -673C &gt; T and -1318T &gt; G genetic variants in c-Jun promoter regions contribute to an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, possibly by elevating the transcription activity and protein expression levels that appeared to upregulate activity of c-Jun thus <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
