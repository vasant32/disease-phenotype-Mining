<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and safety were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was not powered to establish non-inferiority, but aimed at the estimation of treatment differences.ResultsOf 152 randomized eligible patients, 75 were treated in arm 1 and 77 in arm 2; ORRs [53% versus 62%, odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-2.66], PFS [median 9.5 versus 9.2 months, hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.34], OS (median 25.8 versus 23.0 months, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56-1.30) and DCR (87%) were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRs adjusted for baseline factors were 1.01 and 0.99 for PFS and OS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of grade 3/4 adverse events in arms 1 versus 2 were similar: most common were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (28% versus 34%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (15% versus 17%).ConclusionsActivity and safety of FOLFOX4 plus either cetuximab administered weekly or every second week were similar </plain></SENT>
