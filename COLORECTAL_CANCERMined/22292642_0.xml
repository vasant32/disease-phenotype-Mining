<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Knowledge is believed to be a driving factor for patients' early presentation for healthcare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to assess knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among subjects presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> and to determine its association with late presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 80 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>, aged 40 and above, was conducted between December 2008 and June 2009 in the endoscopy unit, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The research instruments used in this study was a self-administered questionnaire including data on duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>, first medical consultation and knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty percent of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> delayed seeking medical advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were more aware of symptoms of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> compared to symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of subjects (63.8%) correctly identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> as a symptom but were not aware of the best screening method to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Half of the subjects knew increasing age and genetic background to be risk factors for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was not found to be significantly associated with delay in seeking help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Findings indicate poor awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although public education of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is important for early presentation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>, further studies are advocated to evaluate other factors influencing patients' help seeking behavior other than knowledge </plain></SENT>
