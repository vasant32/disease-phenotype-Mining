<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Hepatic metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is best managed with a multimodal approach; however, the optimal timing of liver resection in relation to administration of perioperative chemotherapy remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our strategy has been to offer up-front liver resection for patients with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e>, followed by post-liver resection chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the outcomes of patients based on this surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> over a 5-year period (2002-2007) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between clinicopathologic factors and survival were evaluated by the Cox proportional hazard method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 320 patients underwent 336 liver resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 40 (range 8-80) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority (n=195, 60.9%) had metachronous disease, and most patients (n=286, 85%) had a major hepatectomy (&gt;3 segments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients (11%) received preoperative chemotherapy, predominantly for downstaging unresectable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ninety-day mortality was 2.1%, and perioperative morbidity occurred in 68 patients (20.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Actual disease-free survival at 3 and 5 years was 46.2% and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actual overall survival (OS) at 3 and 5 years was 63.7% and 55%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified four factors that were independently associated with differences in OS (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval): size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>&gt;6 cm (2.2; 1.3-3.5), positive lymph node status of the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (N1 (2.0; 1.0-3.8), N2 (2.4; 1.2-4.9)), synchronous disease (2.1; 1.3-3.5), and treatment with chemotherapy after liver resection (0.42; 0.23-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Up-front surgery for patients with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, followed by chemotherapy, can lead to favorable OS </plain></SENT>
