<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A set of 13 core measures was used to evaluate the quality of care in 708 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients treated from 2004 to 2007 at a hospital in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 100% adherence standard was used to measure the relationship of adherence to patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each indicator assigned by each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage was dichotomously coded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associations between the adherence and survival rates and demographic characteristics were assessed using Cox's proportional hazard regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physician adherence to core indicators was plotted using a bubble chart to motivate physicians' performance adhering to quality-of-care guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 100% adherence rate criterion contributed to a relatively low hazard ratio of 0.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.85; P= 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between the adherence rate and survival indicated significant improvements for stage III patients compared with stage I patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A graphical representation of bubble charts helped to monitor physician performance, which improved the adherence rate to quality-of-care guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
