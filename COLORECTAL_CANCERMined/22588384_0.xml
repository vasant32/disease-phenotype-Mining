<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of netrin-1 and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> receptor in human diseased and healthy lumbar intervertebral discs (IVDs) and to clarify the correlation between netrin-1 expression and the degree of neurovascular ingrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have shown neurovascular ingrowth into the inner regions of degenerated IVD and suggested that the ingrowth may contribute to discogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>low back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1 is an axon guidance molecule that regulates axons seeking their final targets and has been identified as involved in various pathological conditions, so is its <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the role of netrin-1 in diseased IVDs remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five diseased IVD specimens were collected from 34 patients with different lumbar diseases during posterior lumbar interbody fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> discs were obtained at autopsy as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using polyclonal or monoclonal antibody, the disc slides were immmunostained to detect the expression and distribution of netrin-1, the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, the neuronal marker (neurofilament), and the vascular endothelial cell marker (CD34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Netrin-1 and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> immunopositive cells distributed substantially from the annulus fibrosus to the nucleus pulposus (NP), and the immunopositivity was detected in the disc cells, endothelial cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> cells in the diseased discs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of netrin-1 positive disc cells of the NP was more than that of the annulus fibrosus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of netrin-1 and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> was weak in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> discs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation between the percentage of netrin-1 immunopositive disc cells and neurovascular scores was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increased expression of netrin-1 and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> in diseased IVDs compared with controls suggested that they might play an important role in the process of neurovascular ingrowth </plain></SENT>
