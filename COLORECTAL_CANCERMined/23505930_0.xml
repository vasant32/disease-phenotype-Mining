<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The putative association between serum adiponectin levels and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> is actually under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate this association in relation to factors known to influence the levels of adiponectin such as anthropometric, metabolic, inflammatory parameters as well as lifestyle individual characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 40 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 40 controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressure were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic Syndrome</z:e> was defined and lifestyle characteristics assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences were found in adiponectin values between patients and controls (p = 0.101) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels were significantly higher in females than in males (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels did not result in significant association with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> even after adjustment for metabolic and life style parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study did not confirm the hypothesis that high levels of adiponectin confer decreased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
