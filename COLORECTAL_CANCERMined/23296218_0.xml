<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> there is discussion about the possible relation between the mismatch repair protein expression (MMRPE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e> (TLI), as well as the possible prognostic effect of both factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A review was made of 243 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, consecutively resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We made an immunohystochemical study of the MMRPE of MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TLI was evaluated through CD3 staining in the tumoural epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared mortality and post-operative tumoural progression amongst the cases with and without MMRPE and with and without TLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we studied mortality and tumoural progression amongst MMRPE (+) cases, according to whether or not they presented TLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen point six percent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> expressed MMRPE (+) and 25.5% TLI (+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was: 73.8Â±34.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of TLI (+) turned out to be similar between MMRPE (+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>: 27.3% and MMRPE (-): 25.2% (p = 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The MMRPE (+) cases showed less mortality: 12.1% versus 23.3% (p = 0.15) and less tumoural progression: 21.2% versus 29% (p = 0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ITL <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (+) had a lower mortality: 9.7% versus 26% [p = 0.007; OR = 3.27(1.25-9.05)] and tumoural progression: 12.9% versus 33.1% [p = 0.002; OR = 3.35 (1.42-8.15)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 9 MMRPE (+) and ILT (+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> did not present mortality or tumoural progression, against a mortality: 16.7% and progression: 29.2% of the 24 MMRPE (+) and TLI (-) cases p = 0.19 and p = 0.07 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No relation was found between MMRPE and TLI, with very similar rates of TLI (+) between cases with and without MMRPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The LTI (+) showed a favourable prognostic effect higher than that of the MMRPE (+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The combination of LTI (+) and MMRPE (+) seems to have an accumulative protective effect, although its limited frequency reduces the significance of the finding </plain></SENT>
