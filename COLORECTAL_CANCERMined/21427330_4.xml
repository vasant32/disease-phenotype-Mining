<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751366" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Radiation-related cancer</z:e> risk was estimated using risk projection models based on the National Research Council's Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) VII Committee's report and screening protocols from the American College of Radiology Imaging Network's National CT Colonography Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Uncertainty intervals were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparative modeling with three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> microsimulation models was used to estimate the potential reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated mean effective dose per CTC screening study was 8 mSv for women and 7 mSv for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751366" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">radiation-related cancers</z:e> resulting from CTC screening every 5 years from the age of 50 to 80 years was 150 cases/100,000 individuals screened (95% uncertainty interval, 80-280) for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> prevented by CTC every 5 years from age 50 to 80 ranged across the three microsimulation models from 3580 to 5190 cases/100,000 individuals screened, yielding a benefit-risk ratio that varied from 24:1 (95% uncertainty interval, 13:1-45:1) to 35:1 (19:1-65:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The benefit-risk ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> was even higher than the ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751366" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">radiation-related cancer</z:e> risks from CT examinations performed to follow up extracolonic findings did not materially alter the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Concerns have been raised about recommending CTC as a routine screening tool because of potential harms including the radiation risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these models, the benefits from CTC screening every 5 years from the age of 50 to 80 years clearly outweigh the radiation risks </plain></SENT>
