<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The release of soluble antigens, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells, has been investigated for diagnostic purposes, but not for its immunological consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we address the question of whether soluble CEA influences <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were injected with soluble CEA protein, and CEA-specific CD8 T cells were analyzed for their phenotype and functionality by means of restimulation ex vivo or antitumor efficacy in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We furthermore characterized the CD8 T cell population in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) from healthy donors and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mice, circulating CEA was preferentially taken up in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> receptor-dependent manner and cross-presented by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, but not dendritic cells, to CD8 T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such systemically circulating CEA promoted tolerization of CEA-specific CD8 T cells in the endogenous T cell repertoire through the coinhibitory molecule B7H1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These CD8 T cells were not deleted but were rendered nonresponsive to antigen-specific stimulation and failed to control growth of CEA-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These nonresponsive CD8 T cells were phenotypically similar to central memory T cells being CD44(high) CD62L(high) CD25(neg)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found T cells with a similar phenotype in PBMCs of healthy donors and at increased frequency also in patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence for the existence of an unrecognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immune escape involving cross-presentation of systemically circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigens that may influence immunotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
