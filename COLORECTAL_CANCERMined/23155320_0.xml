<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies through January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Search terms were "bisphosphonates" or trade names of the drugs, and "observational studies" or "cohort studies" or "case-control studies" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two evaluators reviewed and selected articles on the basis of predetermined selection criteria as followed: (1) observational studies (case-control or cohort studies) on bisphosphonate use; (2) with at least 2 years of follow-up; and (3) reported data on the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DerSimonian and Laird random effects model were used to calculate the pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-by-two contingency table was used to calculate the outcomes not suitable for meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup meta-analyses were conducted for the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (esophageal, gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the effect sizes when only studies with long-term follow-up (mean 5 years; subgroup 3 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 740 screened articles, 3 cohort studies and 3 case-control studies were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At first, 4 cohort studies and 3 case-control studies were selected for the analyses but one cohort study was excluded because the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes were not categorized by type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More than 124,686 subjects participated in the 3 cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cohort studies combined was approximately 3.88 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 3 case-control studies reported 3070 esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 15,417 controls, 2018 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> cases and 10,007 controls, and 11,574 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 53,955 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The percentage of study participants who used bisphosphonate was 2.8% among the cases and 2.9% among the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the studies found no significant association between bisphosphonate use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Also no statistically significant association was found in a meta-analysis of long-term follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was no negative association between bisphosphonate use and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in the overall analysis (RR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.65-1.42, I(2) = 52.8%, P = 0.076) and no statistically significant association with long-term follow-up (RR 1.74, 95% CI: 0.97-3.10, I(2) = 58.8%, P = 0.119) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No negative association was found in the studies reporting the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (RR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.71-1.13, I(2) = 0.0%, P = 0.472) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, there was no association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and bisphosphonate use (RR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.30-1.29, I(2) = 88.0%, P = 0.004) and also in the analysis with long-term follow-up (RR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.28-1.35, I(2) = 84.6%, P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral bisphosphonate use had no significant effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, this finding should be validated in randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
