<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as a minimally invasive procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are still difficulties concerning effective triangulation and countertraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study's purpose was to clarify the usefulness of the colon-lifting technique (CLT) in SILS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SILS was performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (cT2N0 or less) of the right-sided colon (near the ileocecum), sigmoid, or rectosigmoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SILSâ„¢ Port was used for transumbilical access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A suture string was inserted through the abdominal wall and passed through the mesocolon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The colon was retracted anteriorly and fixed to the abdominal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main mesenteric vessels were placed under tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymph node dissection was performed by medial approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Short-term surgical outcomes and access port costs were compared between SILS (using CLT) and the standard multiport technique (MPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The two groups were case-matched by propensity scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analyzed variables included preoperative Dukes stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From June 2009 to April 2011, 27 patients underwent SILS, and from April 2005 to April 2011, 85 patients underwent MPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Propensity scoring generated 23 matched patients per group for SILS versus MPT comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in operating time, blood loss, early complications, postoperative <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> frequency, or length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One MPT patient was converted to open surgery (4.5%); no SILS patients were converted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the length of distal cut margin and the number of harvested lymph nodes, except incision length (SILS vs. MPT: 33 vs. 55 mm, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Significant differences favored SILS in access instrument cost (SILS vs. MPT: 62,761 vs. 77,130 Japanese yen, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SILS performed using CLT was safe and effective in providing radical treatment of cT2N0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the right-sided colon, sigmoid, or rectosigmoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>SILS was advantageous with respect to cosmesis and lower cost of access instruments </plain></SENT>
