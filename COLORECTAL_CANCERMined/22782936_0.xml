<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Although much data have accumulated on sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>/lesion (SSA/P/L) in general, its characteristics in specified contexts are less well elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This lack of knowledge is even more conspicuous concerning its borderline counterpart, referred to as BSSA/P/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The previous histological observations of the authors on SSA/P/L and BSSA/P/L in general are here extended to encompass attributes of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in the context of synchronous colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (SCRC), with a focus on the place of BSSA/P/L in the spectrum of non-dysplastic serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 219 SSA/P/Ls, 206 BSSA/P/Ls and 170 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi>) were examined for SCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> details (size, site, BRAF((V600E))) and advanced synchronous conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SCRC was present in 12.3% of SSA/P/Ls, 7.1% of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> (p=0.09) and 8.3% of BSSA/P/Ls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients' ages were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gender distribution of SSA/P/L and BSSA/P/L was equal, which differed, albeit insignificantly, from a male predominance of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More SSA/P/Ls and BSSA/P/Ls than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> exceeded 4 mm (pâ‰¤0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A proximal site characterised SSA/P/L compared with BBSA/P/L and HP (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation was more prevalent in SSA/P/Ls and BSSA/P/Ls, which further coexisted with advanced synchronous conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> less commonly than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BSSA/P/L was like SSA/P/L in most respects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The lower SCRC prevalence of BSSA/P/L could fit the idea of BSSA/P/L as a precursor to SSA/P/L, a notion that deserves attention when formulating guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
