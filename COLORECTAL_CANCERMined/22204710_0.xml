<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and prognostic significance of budding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> after neoadjuvant radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical specimens from 96 consecutive patients who underwent neoadjuvant radiotherapy and curative resection were retrieved to assess budding and other clinicopathologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and prognostic significance of postirradiation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding were closely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grade 1 group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding presented as "false budding" and did not have a significant association with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grade 2 and 3 groups, budding was observed surrounded by radiation-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and large populations of infiltrating inflammatory cells, and budding intensity was significantly associated with histologic differentiation, ypN stage, and lymphovascular invasion (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the low-grade budding subgroup showed a significantly higher rate of 5-year disease-free survival than the high-grade budding subgroup (87.5% versus 55.6%, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that pretreatment serum carcinoembyronic antigen, <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grade, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding were the major independent factors affecting long-term disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, postirradiation budding has distinct <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and prognostic significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> after neoadjuvant radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
