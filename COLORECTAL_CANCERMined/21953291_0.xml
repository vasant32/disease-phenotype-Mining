<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We histologically assessed the relationships of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> to major intrahepatic vessels after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 45 patients who underwent chemotherapy and hepatectomy with pretreatment images showing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> attached to or invading major intrahepatic vessels, 77 metastases showed attachment to or invasion of 96 vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using postchemotherapy imaging, 11 of 77 metastases (14.3%) appeared separated from 12 of 96 major hepatic vessels (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 83 vessels later examined pathologically, 29 showed direct invasion (35%) and 10 showed attachment (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> involved another 9 vessels (11%) that were separated surgically from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and preserved during hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> attachment that exceeded 25% of vessel circumferences via imaging after chemotherapy was a factor associated with pathological vascular invasion or attachment according to multivariate analysis (relative risk, 8.449; 95% confidence interval, 1.961-36.415; P = .0042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Liver metastasis</z:e> attachment to or invasion of major intrahepatic vessels is difficult to eradicate even with otherwise effective chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
