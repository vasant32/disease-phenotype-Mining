<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For inoperable patients, we evaluated in this study intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy (IMRT-IGRT) by helical tomotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with ≤ 5 metastases were enrolled, receiving a dose of 50 Gy in fractions of 5 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No limitations concerning dimension or localization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were imposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole body PET-CT was performed at baseline and 3 months after the initiation of RT to evaluate the metabolic response rate according to PET Response Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> (PERCIST) version 1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 53 metastases were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (71%) received previously ≥ 1 line of chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, displaying residual (n = 7) or progressive (n = 10) metabolic active oligometastatic disease at time of inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most common sites were the lung, liver and lymphnodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient (4%) experienced grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients were evaluated by post-treatment PET-CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients achieved a complete (n = 6) or partial (n = 6) metabolic response, resulting in an overall metabolic response rate of 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 10 months, 7 patients (29%) are in remission, of which 5 received previous chemotherapy with residual oligometastatic disease at time of inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The actuarial 1-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 54%, 14% and 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy delivering 10 fractions of 5 Gy resulted in a metabolic response rate of 55%, and appeared to be attractive as consolidation of inoperable oligometastatic disease after effective chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
