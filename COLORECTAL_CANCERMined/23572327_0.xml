<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to examine the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with active smoking among members of the California Teachers Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e>), a large cohort of female public school employees for whom highly detailed smoking information is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The analysis was conducted among the 122,264 CTS participants who lived in California at cohort entry in 1995/1996, had no prior history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and provided detailed smoking information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1,205 cases of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prospectively diagnosed in 1995-2009 were identified from the California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, including 650 in the proximal colon, 267 in the distal colon, and 288 in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by age at cohort entry, and adjusted for race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to never smokers, current smokers had an approximately 30 % increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, a slightly elevated risk was also noted for former smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among former smokers, risks appeared to remain elevated for up to 20 years following cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risks among former and current smokers increased with greater intensity and duration of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Little evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in risk was noted for colon versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> or for different subsites within the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results provide convincing evidence that heavy and/or long-term smoking is a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the colon</z:e> and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such evidence should be considered when updating screening guidelines to include targeting people with long active smoking histories </plain></SENT>
