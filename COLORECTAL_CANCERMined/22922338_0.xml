<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A major problem in clinical trials of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing ligand (TRAIL) as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy is the development of resistance to TRAIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, agents that can overcome TRAIL resistance have great therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated capsazepine, a TRPV1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, for its ability to sensitize human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells to TRAIL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Capsazepine potentiated the effect of TRAIL, as shown by its effect on intracellular esterase activity; activation of caspase-8,-9, and -3; and colony-formation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Capsazepine induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptors (DRs) DR5 and DR4, but not decoy receptors, at the transcriptional level and in a non-cell-type-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DR induction was dependent on CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), as shown by (a) the induction of CHOP by capsazepine and (b) the abolition of DR- and potentiation of TRAIL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by CHOP gene silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CHOP induction was also reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent, as shown by capsazepine's ability to induce ROS and by the quenching of ROS by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, which prevented induction of CHOP and DR5 and consequent sensitization to TRAIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Capsazepine's effects appeared to be mediated via JNK, as shown by capsazepine's ability to induce JNK and by the suppression of both CHOP and DR5 activation by inhibition of JNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ROS sequestration abrogated the activation of JNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, capsazepine downregulated the expression of various antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., cFLIP and survivin) and increased the expression of proapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax and p53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, our results indicate that capsazepine potentiates the apoptotic effects of TRAIL through downregulation of cell survival proteins and upregulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptors via the ROS-JNK-CHOP-mediated pathway </plain></SENT>
