<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in combination with the Western-style diet, physical inactivity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> have been hypothesized to affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolizers of environmental carcinogenic and endogenous compounds affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk include the phase II detoxification <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes UGT2B17 and UGT2B28, which are 2 of the most commonly deleted genes in the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To study the effect of UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 copy number variation (CNV) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, 665 Caucasian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and 621 Caucasian controls were genotyped who had completed extensive demographics and lifestyle questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant association between the UGT2B17 deletion genotype (0/0) and decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was found when the entire population was analyzed (P = .044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratification by sex yielded a decreased risk (P = .020) in men with the UGT2B17 deletion (0/0), but no association was observed in women (P = .724) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant association between UGT2B17 (0/0) and decreased risk for rectal (P = .0065) but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between UGT2B28 CNV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The UGT2B17 deletion genotype (0/0) was associated with a decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in a Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After sex stratification, the association was observed in men but not in women, which is consistent with previous findings that men have higher UGT2B17 expression and activity than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because UGT2B17 metabolizes certain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> with antioxidative properties, individuals with a gene deletion may have higher levels of these protective dietary components </plain></SENT>
