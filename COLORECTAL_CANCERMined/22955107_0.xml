<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PIK3CA, a catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase, is known to be activated in ovarian clear cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>), which is categorized as type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of PIK3CA overexpression in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed immunohistochemical analyses of PIK3CA, PTEN, p-Akt, p27 and p53 expressions in primary ovarian clear cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from 62 Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic analyses of PIK3CA mutation and amplification were further conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PIK3CA was overexpressed in 45 tumors (73%), PTEN expression was negative in 3 (5%), and p53 was positive in 8 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpressed PIK3CA was found to be associated with p-Akt overexpression (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PIK3CA overexpression tended to be observed in more of stage I disease (73% versus 47%, P = .07) and was associated with absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> at the initial surgery (96% versus 71%, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, survival analyses revealed that PIK3CA overexpression correlated with improved overall survival (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent genetic analyses demonstrated that PIK3CA overexpression correlated with the presence of mutation or amplification of the PIK3CA gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that the subgroup of ovarian clear cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> harboring activated PIK3CA seems to have better prognosis possibly due to more indolent biological property compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> without PIK3CA activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PIK3CA may serve as a biomarker for good prognosis and a possible therapeutic target in this lethal subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
