<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Certain large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> satisfy expanded indications for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD); however, the resulting large mucosal defects may contribute to complications such as delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various closure devices and methods have been developed for large mucosal defects to prevent such complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of a new and simple technique for closing large mucosal defects after colorectal ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Pilot feasibility study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Ten patients with 10 tumors half circumferential or less in size with sufficient muscle layer exposure after ESD were selected and treated by using the closure technique between July 2009 and June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Small mucosal incisions were made around the mucosal defect by the same needle-knife used during ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These incisions provided a better grip for conventional clips, which then facilitated lifting the surrounding mucosa across the defect without slipping, thereby making it considerably easier to reduce the size of the defect and place additional clips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Patient characteristics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clinicopathologic features were assessed as well as closure completion rate, closure procedure time, and closure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 tumors were successfully treated by ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean lesion size was 26.8 mm (range 8-50 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mucosal defects were completely closed by using the new closure technique, without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean closure procedure time was 15 minutes (range 8-35 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Small sample size with specifically selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Large mucosal defects resulting from colorectal ESD can be completely closed with small mucosal incisions by using conventional clips </plain></SENT>
