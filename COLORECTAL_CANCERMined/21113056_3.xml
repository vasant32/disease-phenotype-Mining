<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA from 120 macrodissected specimens was examined by the amplification refractory mutation system-Scorpion assay and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA mixtures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant KRAS genes were prepared from the peripheral blood and the SW620 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line for the model experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutation was identified in 50 samples (41.7%) by the amplification refractory mutation system-Scorpion assay and 42 samples (35.0%) by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discordance between the two methods was observed for samples with smaller amounts of amplifiable DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of direct sequencing was impaired by the decrease in template DNA and polymerase chain reaction cycles in the experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased sensitivity of direct sequencing caused by insufficient polymerase chain reaction amplification resulted in biased discordance between direct sequencing and amplification refractory mutation system-Scorpion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction conditions satisfactory for amplifying tens of haploid copies of genomic DNA to the saturation level might be necessary to ensure the robustness of the direct sequencing-based method employed for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimen-derived DNA samples </plain></SENT>
