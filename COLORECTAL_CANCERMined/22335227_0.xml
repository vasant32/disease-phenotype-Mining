<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to be a predictor of poor survival in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised NLR might predict prognosis for patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CRLM) undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 92 consecutive patients with metachronous CRLM treated with RFA was retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinico-pathological characteristics, recurrence, overall and disease-free survival were compared according to preoperative NLR level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors were assessed by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated NLR (&gt;5) was recorded in 21 patients (22.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlations between NLR and clinico-pathological characteristics were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete ablation was achieved in 90 patients (97.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After RFA, extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (p = 0.015) were significantly higher in the elevated NLR group whilst local (p = 0.526) and intrahepatic (p = 0.715) recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 1, 3 and 5 years overall survival rates of 92 patients were 86.5%, 74.1%, 36.3%, and disease-free survival was 64.3%, 32.8%, 22.4% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that NLR was an independent prognostic factor for both overall (p = 0.039, HR = 3.59, 95%CI 1.54-9.67) and disease-free survival (p = 0.022, HR = 3.19, 95%CI 1.87-8.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 1, 3, 5 years overall survival rates were 86.9%, 61.1%, 41.7% for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NLR group, and 85.2%, 53.2%, 18.4% for the elevated NLR group respectively (p = 0.036); the corresponding disease-free survival was 64.9%, 38.7%, 26.7% and 47.6%, 14.3%, 9.5% respectively (p = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated NLR (&gt;5) might predict more extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and poorer survival for patients with CRLM after RFA </plain></SENT>
