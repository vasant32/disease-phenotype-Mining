<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have suggested that TERT may be important to the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluate seven TERT SNPs in 1555 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cases and 1956 matched controls and in 754 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> cases and 959 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that two TERT SNPs were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TERT rs2736118 was associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.02, 1.69) and TERT-CLPTM1L rs2853668 was inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.55, 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TERT-CLPTM1L rs2853668 also was inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43, 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMI interacted significantly with three TERT SNPs to alter risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with the variant allele and who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> had the greatest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TERT-CLPTM1L rs2853668 interacted significantly with aspirin/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use, where those with the AA genotype had a much lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> when using aspirin/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> than those with the other genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several TERT SNPs were uniquely associated with CIMP+ and MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data confirm earlier reports of the association between TERT-CLPTM1L and colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our detection of a significant interaction with BMI for multiple TERT SNPs and unique associations with CIMP+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> enhance our understanding of TERT's role in colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
