<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hand-foot-skin reaction (HFSR) is an adverse event frequently observed during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (cape) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present analysis, we sought to evaluate the potential association of HFSR and survival in German patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> treated with cape in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Internistische Onkologie (AIO) KRK-0104 and the Mannheim <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> trial were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HFSR was graded according to NCI-CTC criteria in both trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time to first occurrence of HFSR was described per cycle and HFSR developing during cycles 1 and 2 was defined as 'early HFSR' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics between the patient groups with or without HFSR were compared using Mann-Whitney-U, Fisher's exact or χ(2)-test, as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haematological and non-haematological toxicities observed in both groups were compared using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Progression-free (PFS) or disease-free (DFS) as well as overall survival (OS) data from both trials were pooled and the HFSR group was compared with the non-HFSR using Kaplan-Meier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 374 patients were included, of whom 29.3% developed any HFSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 51% had early HFSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were comparable between both HFSR groups concerning age, gender, ECOG performance status and UICC stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis none of these factors had influence on the occurrence of HFSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-grade (and grade 3-4) haematological toxicities did not differ between both the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By contrast, patients exhibiting HFSR had a significantly higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-grade (but not grade 3-4) diarrhoea, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>/mucositis and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (P&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with HFSR had improved PFS/DFS (29.0 vs 11.4 months; P=0.015, HR 0.69) and OS (75.8 vs 41.0 months; P=0.001, HR=0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Within the HFSR group, PFS/DFS and OS were comparable between patients with early vs late HFSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The present analysis provides evidence for the association of HFSR and survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics, with the exception of UICC stage, older age and ECOG performance status, and the time of occurrence of HFSR had no impact on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patients with HFSR had a higher probability of developing any-grade gastrointestinal toxicity and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> while no correlation with haematological toxicity was found </plain></SENT>
