<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Telomere length is heritable and may be an intermediate phenotype linked to genetic susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a large sample, the study investigated whether candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 'telomere biology' genes were associated with telomere length in leucocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SNP associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were searched for separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carriers of the common allele at SNP rs10936599, near the telomerase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> component (TERC) locus, had significantly longer telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was independently found that the same rs10936599 allele was associated with increased risk of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither telomere length nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was associated with variation near telomerase reverse transcriptase or other telomere biology genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In silico analysis showed that SNP rs2293607 was strongly correlated with rs10936599, mapped within TERC transcripts, had a predicted effect on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> folding and lay at a reported transcription factor binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TERC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were expressed, differing only at the alleles of rs2293607, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line HCT116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-telomere/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-risk allele was associated with higher levels of TERC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the formation of longer telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Common genetic variation at TERC is associated with both longer telomeres and an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, a potential mechanism being reduced levels of cell senescence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding is somewhat paradoxical, given retrospective studies reporting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases have shorter telomeres than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that that association actually results from poorer survival in patients with longer telomeres </plain></SENT>
