<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with SP and their relatives are at increased risk of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the pathologic and molecular profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> in individuals fulfilling World Health Organization criteria for SP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 45 CRCs were obtained from 38 individuals with SP (27 female and 11 male patients; median age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis, 58.5 y) attending genetics clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> samples were pathologically reviewed, screened for somatic BRAF and KRAS mutations, and analyzed immunohistochemically for mismatch repair protein (MMR) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were spread throughout the large intestine, with 64% located in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in BRAF and KRAS and immunohistochemical evidence of MMR deficiency were found in 46%, 5%, and 38%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were BRAF/KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, and these were associated with distal location (63%) and MMR proficiency (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of p53 and/or evidence of Î²-catenin activation were identified in 13 CRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (26%) had synchronous or metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> arising in individuals with SP do not harbor molecular hallmarks of serrated pathway <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> but show a diverse range of molecular profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high proportion of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> suggests that individuals with SP would benefit from frequent colonoscopic surveillance and from a consideration of a more extensive colectomy at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
