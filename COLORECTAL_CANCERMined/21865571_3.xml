<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To characterize the natural history of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (ON) and determine whether intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) is a sensitive measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, we sought to assess the potential of ON as a neuroprotection model and gain insight into the relationship between axon loss and neuropathic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight subjects receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were prospectively followed prior to starting chemotherapy and at 30, 90, 180, and 360 days (180 days after completing treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiology, punch biopsies, symptom assessment, and examinations with calculation of a reduced total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> score (rTNS) were performed at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes over time were assessed through Poisson regression for IENFD and a mixed effects model for rTNS and electrophysiology measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distal leg IENFD, rTNS, peroneal, and sural amplitudes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly reduced over time, while conduction velocity (peroneal and sural) and distal thigh IENFD were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measures of axon loss continued to worsen following discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of 8 subjects reported prominent symptoms associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> is associated with mild, sensory, and motor axon loss that may not be reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003447'>Axonal loss</z:hpo> was detected by electrophysiology, rTNS, and distal leg IENFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several subjects reported prominent sensory symptoms that were not associated with axon loss, and that may or may not represent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ON is an attractive paradigm for neuroprotection studies and the distal leg IENFD is an objective measure that requires minimal subject participation or study site expertise </plain></SENT>
