<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Meta-analyses have been used to evaluate associations between polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, but the quality of individual studies used to inform them may vary substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to apply well-established quality-control criteria to individual association studies and then compare the results of meta-analyses that included or excluded studies that did not meet these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We used meta-analyses of studies reporting a relationship between polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> published between 1996 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> associations were derived in separate meta-analyses including only those meeting the quality-control criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative ORs varied substantially between the open and restricted group meta-analyses for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variants except MTHFR 677 CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the associations were modest and the direction of relative risk did not change after applying criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Publication bias was detected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associations, except the restricted set of studies for GSTP1 GG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We observed variation in calculated relative risk and changes in tests for publication bias that were dependent on the inclusion criteria used for association studies of polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Standardizing study inclusion criteria may reduce the variation in findings for meta-analyses of gene-association studies of common diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
