<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate whether, under the influence of polypectomy, the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> decreases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> identified at index colonoscopy were retrospectively selected if they had undergone three or more complete colonoscopies, at least 24 mo apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who had any first-degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data regarding number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at each colonoscopy, their location, size and histological classification were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monthly incidence density of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> after the index examination was estimated for the study population, by using the person-years method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were excluded from incidence calculations but their characteristics were correlated with recurrence at follow-up, using the χ(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six patients were included (109 male, mean age at index colonoscopy 56.8 ± 10.3 years), with follow-up that ranged from 48 to 232 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were observed between the number, the presence of villous component, or the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at index colonoscopy and the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at subsequent colonoscopies (P = 0.49, 0.12 and 0.78, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was observed to decay from 1.4% person-months at the beginning of the study to values close to 0%, at 12 years after index colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> occurs within a discrete period and that, when these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> are removed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>-prone clones may be extinguished </plain></SENT>
