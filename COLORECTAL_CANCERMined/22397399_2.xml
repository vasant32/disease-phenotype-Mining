<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyse the possible predictive value of miRNA-126 in relation to first line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 89 patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) was performed to detect miRNA-126 in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of miRNA-126, area per image (μm(2)), was measured using image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was evaluated according to RECIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression free survival (PFS) was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> were classified as low or high miRNA-126 expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> using the median value from the patients with response as cut-off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median miRNA-126 expression level was significantly higher in patients responding to XELOX, 3629 μm(2) (95% CI, 2566-4846), compared to the patients not responding, 1670 μm(2) (95% CI, 1436-2041), p &lt; 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was 90%, and the negative predictive value was 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median PFS of patients with high expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> was 11.5 months (95% CI, 9.0-12.7 months) compared to 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.8-6.9 months) for patients with low expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, p &lt; 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> quantified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> of miRNA-126 was related to response to first line XELOX in patients with mCRC, translating to a significant difference in PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of miRNA-126 remains to be further elucidated in prospective studies </plain></SENT>
