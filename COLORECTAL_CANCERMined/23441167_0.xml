<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number (GCN) has been previously demonstrated to correlate with the clinical outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), although it remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess EGFR GCN as a potential biomarker of survival for patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> receiving treatment with anti-EGFR mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We systematically identified articles investigating EGFR GCN by fluorescent or chromogenic in situ hybridization or other detection techniques in patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated with panitumumab or cetuximab, (last search: 10 August 2012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible studies had to report on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) or time-to-progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), stratified by EGFR GCN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Summary hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using random-effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 13 identified studies, 10 (776 patients, 302 with increased GCN), 8 (893 patients, 282 with increased GCN) and 3 (149 patients, 66 with increased GCN) were eligible for the OS, PFS and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> meta-analyses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased EGFR GCN was associated with increased OS (HR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.50-0.77; P&lt;0.001), PFS (HR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.89; P = 0.008) but not <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.44-1.14; P = 0.157) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that EGFR GCN is independent of other factors such as KRAS status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those populations received second-line or higher treatment, increased EGFR GCN was strongly associated with improved survival (for OS, HR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.47-0.75; P&lt;0.001; for PFS, HR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.47-0.75; P&lt;0.001), whereas it did not influence survival in patients that received first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among the anti-EGFR-treated patients, increased EGFR GCN appears to be associated with improved survival outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect on survival appears to be related to patients receiving the line of treatment </plain></SENT>
