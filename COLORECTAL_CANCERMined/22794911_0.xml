<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A case-control study using seventy-one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and eighty unrelated healthy controls was carried out to assess the genetic association of fifteen SNP and one insertion in nine genes belonging to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism selection was based on literature data, and included those which have a known or suspected functional impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and missense polymorphisms that are most likely to alter protein function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR and PCR followed by restriction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The likelihood ratio statistic indicated that most of the polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was observed for two variant alleles of SNP mapping on the transcobalamin 2 gene (TCN2): C776G (rs1801198) and c.1026-394T&gt;G (rs7286680) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering the crucial biological function played by one-carbon metabolism genes, further investigations with larger cohorts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients are needed in order to confirm our preliminary results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results indicate that TCN2 polymorphisms can be a susceptibility factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
