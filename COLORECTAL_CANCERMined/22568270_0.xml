<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several quality indicators and guidelines have been proposed, polypectomy practices are still subject to great variation among endoscopist and little data is available regarding polypectomy practices in real life settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of the 1061 screening colonoscopies performed in 2010 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Bucharest were reviewed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopies where at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> was detected were selected for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, the resection rate and method used for polypectomy were studied and compared to colonoscopy quality indicators previously reported in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 941 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were detected in 395 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was found in 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>548 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (58.23%) were removed endoscopically, with at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> being resected in 283 patients (71.5%), resulting in a polypectomy rate of 26.67% in the entire study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cold forceps resection was the most commonly used method for the resection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> less than 5 mm in size, while for larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> hot snare was the preferred method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitant invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and a larger number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were predictive of incomplete removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most quality indicators were met in our study group, with suboptimal performance regarding histological documentation of detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and establishing a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-free colon </plain></SENT>
