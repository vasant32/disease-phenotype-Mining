<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of plasma big ET-1, the stable precursor of ET-1, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival in patients having curative surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Seventy-seven patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between January 2000 and January 2001 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database including long-term follow-up information (median follow up 84 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The influence of plasma big ET-1 and clinicopathological variables upon over <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival was determined by univariate and multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On univariate analysis, advanced Dukes' stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size and patient age were associated with shortened overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Advanced Dukes' stage was the only factor associated with shortened survival on multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma big ET-1 showed no association with either overall or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma big ET-1 appears to have no prognostic value in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
