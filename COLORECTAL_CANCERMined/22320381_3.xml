<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, and the aberrant expression or mutations of DNA methyltransferase genes are found in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The enzymes for demethylating 5-methylcytosine were recently identified, and the biological significance of DNA demethylation is a current focus of scientific attention in various research fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins have an enzymatic activity for the conversion from 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), which is an intermediate of DNA demethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The loss-of-function mutations of TET2 gene were reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, suggesting that impaired TET-mediated DNA demethylation could play a crucial role in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is still unknown, however, whether DNA demethylation is involved in biological properties in solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we show the loss of 5-hmC in a broad spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>: for example, a significant reduction of 5-hmC was found in 72.7% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) and 75% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> compared to background tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TET1 expression was decreased in half of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, and a large part of them was followed by the loss of 5-hmC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the amount of 5-hmC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is often reduced via various mechanisms, including the downregulation of TET1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistently, in the in vitro experiments, the downregulation of TET1 was clearly induced by oncogene-dependent cellular transformation, and loss of 5-hmC was seen in the transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the critical roles of aberrant DNA demethylation for oncogenic processes in solid tissues </plain></SENT>
