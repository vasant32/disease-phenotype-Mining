<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has recently been applied to treatment of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>; however, its safety and efficacy in terms of follow-up outcomes in elders have not been thoroughly examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to describe the clinical outcomes of colorectal ESD in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of patients, elderly (â‰¥ 75 years of age) and non-elderly (&lt; 75 years of age), who underwent colorectal ESD at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Hospital from February 1998 to December 2010 were retrospectively compared on the following measures: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, procedure time, complication rates, en bloc resection rates, and curative resection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the follow-up outcomes in non-curative resection cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 614 consecutive patients treated by colorectal ESD, 125 (20.4 %) comprised the elderly group, and 489 patients (79.6 %) comprised the non-elderly group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, procedure time, complication rates, en bloc resection rates, and curative resection rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who underwent non-curative resection, 7/19 (36.8 %) and 47/63 (74.6 %) in the elderly and non-elderly group, respectively, underwent additional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the elderly patients who were followed up without additional treatment, no case of local recurrence, residual lesions, or distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was observed during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment outcomes of colorectal ESD were equivalent in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, many of the non-curative cases in the elderly patients were followed up without additional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on the outcome in such patients to confirm the feasibility of colorectal ESD in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
