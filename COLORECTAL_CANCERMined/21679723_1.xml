<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a racial difference exists in self-reported recommendations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening from a health care provider, and whether this difference has changed over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Secondary analysis of the 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008 Maryland <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Surveys, cross-sectional population-based random-digit-dial surveys on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were 11,368 White and 2495 Black Maryland residents age â‰¥ 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For each race, recommendations for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy increased over time (67%-83% for Whites, 57%-74% for Blacks; p&lt;0.001 for both), but the race difference remained approximately 10% at each survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among respondents without a colonoscopy in the last 10 years (n=5081), recommendations for fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in the past year decreased over time for Whites (37%-24%, p&lt;0.001) and for Blacks (36-28%, p=0.05), with no difference by race in any year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, the effect of race on the odds of reporting a provider recommendation did not vary significantly across time for either test (p=0.80 for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, p=0.24 for FOBT for effect modification by year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Whites were more likely than Blacks to report ever receiving a provider recommendation for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the proportion of patients receiving recommendations for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy increased over time, the gap between races remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
