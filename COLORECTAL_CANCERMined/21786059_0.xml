<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: More and more complications of extensive hepatic resection are being encountered in patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100523'>liver abscess</z:hpo> after hepatic resection on overall survival (OS) and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 252 patients treated by liver metastasectomy between 2001 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate was 55.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (8.3%) patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100523'>liver abscess</z:hpo> after liver metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, surgical margin, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100523'>liver abscess</z:hpo> as significant prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients (whether or not they developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100523'>liver abscess</z:hpo> after hepatic resection) had similar progression-free survival (median, 9.8 vs. 12.4 months, P = 0.476), but patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100523'>liver abscess</z:hpo> had significantly shorter OS (26.6 vs. 76.0 months, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent adjuvant therapy significantly improved OS in these patients (16.9 vs. 38.5 months, P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100523'>Liver abscess</z:hpo> after liver metastasectomy is an independent prognostic factor, and adjuvant chemotherapy is warranted in those patients who develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0100523'>liver abscess</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
