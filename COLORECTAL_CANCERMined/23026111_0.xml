<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RFA offers very good local control in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation has emerged as a potential, lung function-preserving treatment of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> underwent computed tomography-guided RFA from December 2004 to June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A baseline posttreatment scan was obtained 4-6 weeks after RFA and follow-up imaging studies every 3 months thereafter were obtained and compared to evaluate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> at site of ablation or elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were LTP-free survival and overall survival from RFA procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazard model with robust inference was used to estimate the associations between baseline factors and survival end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were ablated in 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size ranged from 0.4 to 3.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> ablated per patient was 1 (range, 1-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up after RFA was 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median survival from the time of RFA was 46 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.8-47.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates from the time of RFA were 95% (95% CI, 82%-99%), 72% (95% CI, 52%-85%), and 50% (95% CI, 26%-71%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nine of 69 lesions (13%) progressed and 4 were retreated with no progression after second RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>LTP-free survival from RFA was 92% (95% CI, 82%-97%) at 1 year, 77% (95% CI, 58%-88%) at 2 years, and 77% (95% CI, 58%-88%) at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> is an effective minimally invasive, parenchymal-sparing technique that has very good local control rates in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with LTP-free survival of 77% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
