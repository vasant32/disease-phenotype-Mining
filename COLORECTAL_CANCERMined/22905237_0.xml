<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To confirm the clinical significance of NF-κB and JNK protein expression from experimentally identified candidates for predicting prognosis for patients with 5-FU treatment, we evaluated the protein expression of surgically removed specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 79 specimens were obtained from 30 gastric and 49 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who underwent R0 resection followed by postoperative 5-FU based adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examinations of NF-κB and JNK on tissue microarrays (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi>) revealed that significantly shorter time-to-relapse (TTR) in both NF-κB(+) and JNK(-) subgroups in both gastric (NF-κB(+), p = 0.0002, HR11.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>95%CI3 3.2-43.4; JNK(-), p = 0.0302, HR4.4, 95%CI 1.2-16.6) and colon (NF-κB(+), p = 0.0038, HR36.9, 95%CI 3.2-426.0; JNK(-), p = 0.0098, HR3.2, 95%CI 1.3-7.7) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These protein expression patterns also show strong discriminately power in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> patients for overall survival rate, suggesting a potential utility as prognostic or chemosensitivity markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline expression of these proteins using <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> cell lines demonstrated the reciprocal patterns between NF-κB and JNK, while 5-FU exposure of these cell lines only induced NF-κB, suggesting that NF-κB plays a dominant role in the response to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent siRNA experiments confirmed that gene knockdown of NF-κB increased 5-FU-specific sensitivity, whereas that of JNK did not affect the chemosensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the expression of these proteins may aid in the decisions involved with adjuvant chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal tract cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
