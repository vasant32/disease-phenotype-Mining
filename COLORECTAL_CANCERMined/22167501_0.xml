<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 72 patients with suspected colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> underwent Gd-EOB-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> MRI and DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Images were retrospectively reviewed with unenhanced T(1) and T(2) weighted images as Gd-EOB-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> image set, DW-MRI image set and combined image set by two independent radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each lesion detected was scored for size, location and likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and compared with surgery and follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy was compared using receiver operating characteristics and interobserver agreement by kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 417 lesions (310 metastases, 107 benign) were found in 72 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For both readers, diagnostic accuracy using the combined image set was higher [area under the curve (Az)=0.96, 0.97] than Gd-EOB-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> image set (Az=0.86, 0.89) or DW-MRI image set (Az=0.93, 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using combined image set improved identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> compared with Gd-EOB-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> image set (p&lt;0.001) or DW-MRI image set (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was very good interobserver agreement for lesion classification (Îº=0.81-0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combining DW-MRI with Gd-EOB-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-enhanced T(1) weighted MRI significantly improved the detection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
