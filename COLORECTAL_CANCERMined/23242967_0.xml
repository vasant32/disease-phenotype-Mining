<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate an association between this SNP and colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> in an Iranian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Genotype and allele frequencies of SDF-1 801 G&gt;A were assessed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 109 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 124 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, and 262 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed in the frequencies of genotypes and alleles between patients and controls (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SDF-1 gene polymorphism at position 801 (G&gt;A) was not associated with colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> in Southern Iranian patients </plain></SENT>
