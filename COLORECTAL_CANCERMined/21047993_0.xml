<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent study examined associations of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in 43 fatty acid metabolism-related genes and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), showing rs8752, rs2612656 and a haplotype [comprising both of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] in the hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>) (HPGD) gene to be positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we attempted to replicate these single marker and haplotype associations, using 1795 CRC cases and 1805 controls from the German Darmkrebs: Chancen der Verh√ºtung durch Screening study (DACHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to rs8752 and rs2612656, HPGD tagSNPs rs9312555, rs17360144 and rs7349744 were genotyped for haplotype analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Except for a marginally significant inverse association of HPGD rs8752 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74, 0.98; P = 0.03], none of the analyzed tagSNPs showed any association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subset analyses for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> yielded similar, yet non-significant risk estimates at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, none of the haplotypes was found to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, rs8752 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among individuals with a body mass index &lt; 30 (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.70, 0.95, P = 0.01) as well as among smokers (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.61, 0.90, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Yet, our data do not support the previously reported associations of HPGD tagSNPs and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
