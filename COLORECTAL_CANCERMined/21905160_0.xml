<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is currently known about the long-term impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to describe health status, levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, unmet supportive care needs and positive outcomes in the partners/family members of breast, prostate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors 5-16 years post-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients in a linked study were asked to invite a partner or other close family member to complete a self-administered postal questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site and time since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Matched comparisons were made between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients in the linked study and their partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An expression of interest was received from 330 partners/family members, and 257 questionnaires (77.9%) were returned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Health status and levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were comparable with population norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Respondents reported an average of 2.7 unmet needs from 34 possible options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hospital parking, information about familial risk, help managing fear of recurrence and coordination of care were the most cited unmet needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was little variation in health status, psychological morbidity and unmet needs by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site or time since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concordance between patients and partners was low for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> but higher with respect to positive outcomes and some unmet needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most partners/family members of long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors report few ongoing issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, a small proportion (&lt;10%) have high levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and/or moderate or strong unmet needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Strategies for identifying this group and addressing their needs are required, while allowing the majority to resume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life </plain></SENT>
