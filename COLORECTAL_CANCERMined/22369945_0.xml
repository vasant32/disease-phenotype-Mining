<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation status of β-catenin determines its fate and affects its cellular function, and serine 675 (S675) was previously identified as a common target of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and protein kinase A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we explored the PAK1-specific phosphorylation site(s) in β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active PAK1 T423E but not inactive PAK1 K299R interacted with and phosphorylated β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutagenesis followed by a kinase assay revealed that PAK1 phosphorylated S663 in addition to S675, and an anti-phospho-β-catenin(S663) antibody detected the phosphorylation of S663 downstream of PAK1 in various human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Wnt3a-stimulated S663 phosphorylation was inhibited by the PAK1-specific inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi>-3, but not by H-89 or LY294002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The non-phosphorylatable mutant forms of β-catenin, S663A, S675A and S663/675A, showed similar defects in their PAK1-induced TCF/LEF transactivation, whereas the phosphomimetic form of β-catenin, S663D, demonstrated a transcriptional activity that was comparable to that of β-catenin S675D and β-catenin S663D/S675D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results provide evidence that PAK1 specifically phosphorylates β-catenin at S663 and that this phosphorylation is essential for the PAK1-mediated transcriptional activation of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
