<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and sensitivity of the 3D-reading of fecal-tagging CT colonography (CTC) with a novel structure-analysis electronic cleansing (SAEC) in detecting colorectal flat lesions in comparison with a cleansed 3D reading with Viatronix V3D Colon system (V3D) and primary uncleansed 2D reading (2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty CTC cases with flat lesions were retrospectively observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Subjects from a multicenter clinical trial underwent cathartic bowel preparation with orally administrated <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi>-based fecal-tagging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine flat lesions were confirmed using colonoscopy and histopathology as a reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from SAEC reading were compared with those of prospective V3D and 2D readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall detection sensitivity with SAEC was 52% (36/69), which was statistically higher than that of 32% (22/69) and 29% (20/69) with V3D and 2D readings, respectively (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivities in detecting not-on-fold flat lesions were 63% (24/38), 45% (17/38), and 42% (16/38) with SAEC, V3D, and 2D readings, respectively; whereas those of on-fold flat lesions were 39% (12/31), 16% (5/31), and 13% (4/31), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the eight flat lesions (2-9mm) at cecum was detected by any of the three reading methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excluding the flat lesions at cecum, the sensitivity with SAEC for detecting flat lesion ≥4mm increased to 84% (31/37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The fecal-tagging CTC with structure-analysis electronic cleansing could yield a high sensitivity for detecting flat lesions ≥4mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The not-on-fold flat lesions were detected with higher sensitivity than on-fold flat lesions </plain></SENT>
