<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-term prognosis of anastomotic leakage is poorly documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess whether anastomotic leakage affects five-year survival and local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 5,173 patients were recruited to the Wessex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Audit during the period September 1991 to August 1995 (prospective data, 5-year follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of anastomotic leakage on five-year survival and local recurrence was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,834 patients underwent a curative resection with an anastomosis (anastomotic leak = 71; 3.9 percent): 30-day mortality: 18.3 percent in the leak group, and 3.5 percent in the nonleak group (P &lt; 0.001); local recurrence: 19 percent in the leak group, and 9.8 percent in the nonleak group (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,201 patients underwent colonic anastomosis (anastomotic leak = 31; 2.6 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in local recurrence or five-year survival between the leak and nonleak groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 633 patients underwent rectal anastomosis (anastomotic leakage = 40; 6.3 percent): 30-day mortality: 10 percent in the leak group, and 2 percent in the nonleak group (P = 0.014); cumulative five-year estimate of local recurrence: 25.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 9.6-40.5) percent in the leak group, and 10.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 7.7-13) percent in the nonleak group (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cumulative five-year estimate of overall survival: 52.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 36.1-69.4) percent in the leak group, and 63.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 59.9-67.9) percent in the nonleak group (P = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After rectal anastomosis, an anastomotic leak is associated with a significant increase in local recurrence </plain></SENT>
