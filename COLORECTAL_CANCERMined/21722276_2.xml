<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although embarrassment may be among the most easily modified discrete emotional barriers to patients seeking health care or testing, work in the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has been restricted by the absence of suitable instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current report describes the development and validation of a self-report instrument assessing two specific aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening embarrassment and their links to screening outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 245 European American, African-American, and immigrant Caribbean community-dwelling men and women (aged 45-75 years) living in Brooklyn, New York </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants completed the measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening embarrassment, an array of convergent and divergent validity measures including dispositional embarrassment, general medical embarrassment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neuroticism</z:e>, trait emotion, social desirability, previous treatment avoidance because of embarrassment, relevant health characteristics, and a brief <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening embarrassment was not unidimensional and had two reliable and distinct components, one concentrated on faecal/rectal embarrassment and the other on embarrassment arising from unwanted intimacy during examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to demonstrating patterns of convergent and divergent validity consistent with their separation, multivariate analyses indicated that faecal/rectal embarrassment (but not intimacy concerns) predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current report extends current understanding by identifying the specific sources of embarrassment that may contribute to patients' avoidance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Directions for future study and implications for clinical practice and interventions are discussed </plain></SENT>
