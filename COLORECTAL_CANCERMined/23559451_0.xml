<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>On the basis of substantial preclinical data showing the preventive efficacy of ginger and its constituents in vitro and in animal models, as well as a phase I pilot trial indicating that ginger extract is well tolerated in humans, Citronberg and colleagues conducted a pilot trial of ginger extract (2 g/day for 28 days) on biomarkers of cell proliferation [human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), MIB-1], differentiation (p21waf1/cip1), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (Bax, Bcl-2) in colonic mucosa from individuals at high-risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results from the trial suggest that ginger may reduce proliferation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing colorectal epithelium and increase <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> relative to proliferation, especially in the differentiation zone of colon crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that these results support a larger study to confirm the pilot data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before proceeding with a larger trial, however, it seems prudent to confirm ginger as a chemopreventive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in animals, particularly when tested in postinitiation protocols and to identify reliable molecular biomarkers of effect that could be evaluated in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic studies to examine the distribution and localization of ginger compounds and metabolites in the differentiation and proliferative zones of colonic crypts in animals and humans would also be informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, because the effects of ginger on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa seem minimal, consideration should be given to the conduct of future trials in humans with premalignant colorectal disease </plain></SENT>
