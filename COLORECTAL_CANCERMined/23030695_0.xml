<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Context.- The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR kit is being developed as a companion diagnostic to aid clinicians, through detection of KRAS mutations, in the identification of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) who are more likely to benefit from cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective.- To assess whetherKRASmutation status, determined by using the therascreen KRAS kit, is a predictive marker of cetuximab efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Design.- Tissue samples were obtained from patients with mCRC treated on the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) CO.17 phase 3 study of cetuximab plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> DNA samples were assessed for the presence of KRAS mutations by using the therascreen KRAS kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy and safety were assessed to determine whether mutation status was predictive of outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results.- Evaluable samples were available from 453 patients (79.2%) enrolled in the NCIC CTG CO.17 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> subset represented 54.1% (245 of 453) of the evaluated population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival of patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was 8.6 months among those who received cetuximab plus BSC and 5.0 months among patients who received BSC alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with KRAS mutant mCRC, no meaningful difference in overall survival was observed between arms (HR, 0.91; P = .55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with a previous report that analyzed patient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples by using bidirectional sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions.- These data support the utility of the therascreen KRAS kit as a means of selecting patients who may benefit from cetuximab therapy </plain></SENT>
