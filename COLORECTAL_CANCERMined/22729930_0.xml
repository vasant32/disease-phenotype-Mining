<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To quantify the demographic and clinical factors associated with an increased risk of multiple primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (MPCs) among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Standardized incidence ratios for MPCs were calculated for residents of Queensland, Australia, who were diagnosed with a first primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1996 and 2005 and survived for at least 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative risk ratios were calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MPCs combined and selected individual sites using multivariate Poisson models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,615 MPCs were observed among 15,755 study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohort had a significant excess risk of developing subsequent colorectal (SIR = 1.47, 95 % CI 1.30-1.66) or non-colorectal (SIR = 1.24, 95 % CI 1.18-1.31) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> relative to the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age at initial diagnosis, follow-up time, initial colorectal subsite, and surgical treatment were independently associated (p &lt; 0.01) with the overall risk of developing MPCs after adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative risk ratio was 1.23 (95 % CI 1.07-1.41) for those aged 20-59 years compared with the 70-79 age group and 0.82 (95 % CI 0.72-0.92) for 1-5-year follow-up relative to the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of being diagnosed with a MPC was 33 % higher (95 % CI 1.12-1.56) for surgically treated patients and 45 % higher (95 % CI 1.29-1.64) after proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> relative to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While these population-based results do not incorporate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible risk factors, they form an important foundation from which to further investigate the etiological causes that result in the development of MPCs among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
