<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of 107 elderly patients (â‰¥75 years) undergoing surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were collected from January 2006 to December 2009 in the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Peking University People's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>POSSUM and E-POSSUM scoring systems were used to predict post-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ROC curve and observe/expect(O/E) were used to assess the validity of scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent risk factors associated with post-operative complications of elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The predictive complication rates of E-POSSUM and POSSUM in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were 13.9%-86.6%(average, 32.7%) and 19.1%-99.1% (average, 55.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predictive validity of E-POSSUM was better than POSSUM(AUC of ROC: 0.862 vs. 0.576, O/E: 0.771 vs. 0.454), the former was closer to the actual complication rate(25.2%, 27/107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>(P=0.019) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0577034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rectal lesion</z:e>(P=0.005) were independent risk factors associated with surgery-related post-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic leakage was the most common surgery-related post-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>(P=0.026), <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score(P=0.025), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo>(P=0.037) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>(P=0.001) were independent risk factors associated with non-surgery-related post-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>Pulmonary infection</z:hpo> was the most common non-surgery-related post-operative complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The application of E-POSSUM scoring system can provide more accurate prediction of post-operative complications in elderly patients undergoing surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Positive interventions should be taken for high-risk patients to prevent post-operative complications </plain></SENT>
