<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 787 CRC patients and 551 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study comprised of a training set (520 cases and 341 controls) and a replication set (267 cases and 210 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed associations in rs7849 and rs1399685 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, a dose-dependent trend (per-allele odds ratio (OR), 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-1.00; P for trend = 0.05) associated with the variant allele of rs7849 in the training set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significant trend toward a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was confirmed in the replication set (per-allele OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.99; P for trend = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When stratified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, for left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (LCRC) risk, significant association was observed for the variant-containing genotypes of rs1399685 (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.02-3.06) and the risk was replicated in the replication population (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.02-4.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The variant genotypes of rs9784100 and rs7849 conferred decreased risk but the associations were not replicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (RCRC) susceptibility loci were identified in rs6124509, rs4243289 and rs12218935 but none of the loci was replicated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly suggest that several genetic variants in the UCEs may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility, individually and jointly, and that different genetic etiology may be involved in RCRC and LCRC </plain></SENT>
