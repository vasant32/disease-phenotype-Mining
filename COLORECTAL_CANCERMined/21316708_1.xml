<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognosis and clinicopathologic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the young, compared with those in older patients, continue to be debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the survival, clinicopathologic features, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients aged 40 y or younger and older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 230 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> of stage I-III were assessed retrospectively, with an endpoint of recurrence or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> after curative operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The markers CEA, MMP-2, and p27(kip1) were studied by immunohistochemistry in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The young group comprised 28 (12.2%) patients aged 40 y or younger with a median age of 36 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 202 patients (87.8%) comprised the old group, with a median age of 61 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences in gender distribution, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sites, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, or gross type between the young and old groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The young group had a higher incidence of mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (17.9%) than the old group (6.4%) (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The distribution of stage, differentiation grade, and extent of venous invasion were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median disease-free survival time was 60 mo for the young group and 49 mo for the old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that this difference was not significant (P = 0.1158) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis also demonstrated that the age of the patient was not an independent factor for the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences between the young and old groups in the expression of CEA, MMP-2, or p27(kip1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that there was a subtle difference in the incidence of mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> between young and old patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, stage I-III young patients had a similar disease-free survival period as the older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Other clinicopathologic characteristics, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers such as CEA, MMP-2, and p27(kip1), were also similar between young and old <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
