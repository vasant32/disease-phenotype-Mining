<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the European community-based project '10 000 Steps Ghent', an intervention that resulted in a significant decrease in sedentary time and a significant increase in step counts (896 steps/d) and self-reported walking (66 min/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: An age- and gender-dependent Markov model, with a time horizon of 20 years and a cycle length of 1 year, estimating the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cardiovascular events and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals started in a health state free of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of the intervention was based on published risk reductions related to increased walking time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Costs and utility decrements related to events were obtained from published literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impact of the uncertainty of the parameters on incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were assessed with one-way sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Cohort representing the population reached by the intervention (266 adults aged 25-75 years with a mean age of 48·2 (sd 13·1) years, 45·6 % men, 64·6 % highly educated, 70·0 % employed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Implementing the community-based programme increased average QALY by 0·16 and 0·11 for men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total costs decreased by approximately 576€ and 427€, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, for both genders the intervention programme was dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity analyses did not change the conclusion of dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The community-based '10 000 Steps Ghent' campaign is a dominant intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses have proved the robustness of the results; hence implementing this intervention on a population-based level could lead to improved health outcomes and reduced costs </plain></SENT>
