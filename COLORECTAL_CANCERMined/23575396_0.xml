<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data are available on its effects in patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> was diagnosed before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: : Our aim was to investigate short- and long-term outcomes of surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, particularly regarding effects of adjuvant chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: : This was a prospective cohort study performed at an academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: : Patients with stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> who underwent curative resection were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: : <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOX 4) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: : Potential predictive laboratory and clinical variables and postoperative (30-day) and long-term morbidity and mortality were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Of 63 patients enrolled, 23 (37%) had a total of 82 postoperative complications; 5 patients (8%) died within 30 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo>, preoperative Child class B, low albumin, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, preoperative upper GI tract <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and high intraoperative blood loss were linked to postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 58 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, 20 received the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> regimen and 38 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median length of follow-up was 26 (range, 6-36) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> had higher cumulative incidences of newly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> (p = 0.002), GI tract <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (p = 0.02), and newly formed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 8 of 20 patients (40%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> group and in 5 of 38 patients (13%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates of mean survival time were 34.4 months (95% CI, 32.4-36.5) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin group vs 29.9 months (95% CI, 26-33.7) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> group, and patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> had a significantly higher relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR = 2.98; 95% CI, 1.03-8.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>-specific mortality was not related to treatment type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: : The study was limited by the relatively small sample size and lack of randomization, which may have led to selection bias in treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery can be done safely in portal hypertensive patients with good hepatic function; however, higher mortality is expected in patients with compromised hepatic function reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Compared with adjuvant chemotherapy without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy does not significantly reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific mortality and may increase overall morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy should be used with caution in patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo>, even in those with good liver function </plain></SENT>
