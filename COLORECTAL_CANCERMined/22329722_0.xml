<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS &amp; METHODS: Fifty seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were prospectively included and 40 tumors were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated in first line with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> associated with irinotecan or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response was evaluated using WHO criteria every 2 months after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene-expression profiling was performed using Applied Biosystems microarrays (Human Genome Survey Microarray v2.0; Paris, France) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using Bioconductor packages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differential-expression analysis was performed by fitting a linear model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderated t-statistics were computed and p-values were adjusted for false-discovery rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlations tests were evaluated between gene expression and progression-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nonsupervised analysis did not show any clustering of expression levels according to treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Supervised analysis compared expression levels between responders and nonresponders, within each treatment group and independently from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No genes were identified as differentially expressed at a p-value of 10(-3) and false-discovery rate of 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No correlation between expression levels and survival data was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These negative results show that the determinants of response to chemotherapy should be sought not only in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics, but also among the processes leading to drug availability to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
