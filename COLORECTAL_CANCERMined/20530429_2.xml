<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, it has been reported that TFPI2 (tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2), a Kunitz-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48353">serine proteinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, is frequently methylated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using a gene expression array-based strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study therefore was to examine whether the TFPI2 methylation in surgically removed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> was correlated to the clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The methylation status of the TFPI2 gene was examined in primary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues derived from 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP), and the correlation between the methylation status and the clinicopathological findings was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the TFPI2 gene was detected in 31 out of the 50 (62%) primary colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, suggesting that the methylation of TFPI2 is frequently observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathological data were compared with these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were observed between methylation of TFPI2 and histology (p=0.0053) or lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p=0.0396) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that TFPI2 was more frequently methylated in well-differentiated advanced colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TFPI2 may act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and TFPI2 methylation may present a potential risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
