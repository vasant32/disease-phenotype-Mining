<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> which were taken at clinical relapse in patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> treated with anti-angiogenic therapy using the humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> vessels which are resistant to anti-VEGF therapy are increased in size and characterized by a normalization of the vascular bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice as animal model and xenograft transplantation of human PC-3 prostate <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells in combination with bevacizumab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results confirmed that anti-angiogenic therapy results in enhanced vascular remodeling by vascular stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This process is apparently accompanied by enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These processes interfere with the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy because of reduced susceptibility of stabilized vessels by this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the importance for the development of second generation anti-angiogenic combination therapy concepts to rule out the balance between vascular stabilization followed by a possible de-stabilization making the remained vessels susceptible to a second wave of anti-angiogenic therapy </plain></SENT>
