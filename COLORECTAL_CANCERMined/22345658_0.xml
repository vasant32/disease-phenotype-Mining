<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: 144,542 patients that underwent primary major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection between 2000/2001 and 2007/2008 in 149 English National Health Service units were included from hospital episodes statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Casemix adjusted funnel plots were constructed for 30 day inhospital mortality, length of stay, unplanned readmission within 28 days, reoperation, failure to rescue-surgical (FTR-S) and abdominoperineal excision (APE) rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Institutional performance was evaluated across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other domains for institutions deemed outliers for 30 day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outliers were those that lay on or breached 3 SD control limits. 'Acceptable' performance was defined if units appeared under the upper 2 SD limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 5 high mortality outlier (HMO) units and 15 low mortality outlier (LMO) units were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the five HMO units, two were substandard performance outliers (ie, above 3 SD) on another metric (both on high reoperation rates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further two HMO institutions exceeded the second but not the third SD limits for substandard performance on other outcome metrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the 15 LMO units exceeded 3 SD for substandard performance (APE rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One LMO institution exceeded the second but not the third SD control limits for high reoperation rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Institutional mortality correlated with FTR-S and reoperations (R=0.445, p&lt;0.001 and R=0.191, p&lt;0.020 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Performance appraisal in colorectal surgery is complex and dependent on stakeholder perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Benchmarking units solely on a single performance measure is over simplistic and potentially hazardous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A global appraisal of institutional outcome is required to contextualise performance </plain></SENT>
