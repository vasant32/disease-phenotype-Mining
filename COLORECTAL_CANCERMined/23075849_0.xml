<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This association could be explained by the hypothesis that the same factors and pathways important for wound healing also promote <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sensor of tissue damage should induce these factors to promote tissue repair and regulate their action to prevent development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 22 (IL-22), a cytokine of the IL-10 superfamily, has an important role in colonic epithelial cell repair, and its levels are increased in the blood and intestine of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This cytokine can be neutralized by the soluble IL-22 receptor, known as the IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP, also known as IL22RA2); however, the significance of endogenous IL-22BP in vivo and the pathways that regulate this receptor are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we describe that IL-22BP has a crucial role in controlling <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and epithelial cell proliferation in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-22BP is highly expressed by dendritic cells in the colon in steady-state conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensing of intestinal tissue damage via the NLRP3 or NLRP6 inflammasomes led to an IL-18-dependent downregulation of IL-22BP, thereby increasing the ratio of IL-22/IL-22BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-22, which is induced during intestinal tissue damage, exerted protective properties during the peak of damage, but promoted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development if uncontrolled during the recovery phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the IL-22-IL-22BP axis critically regulates intestinal tissue repair and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in the colon </plain></SENT>
