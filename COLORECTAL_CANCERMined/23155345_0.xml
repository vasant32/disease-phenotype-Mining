<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-seven of 72 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients treated at our hospital fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study which was conducted from December 2010 to February 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients refused to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eventually, 60 patients were included, and randomly assigned to three groups (20 in each group): ACNS group (group A), MB group (group B) and non-stained conventional surgical group (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group A, patients received subserosal injection of 1 mL ACNS in a 4-quadrant region around the mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group B, the main artery of specimen was identified and isolated after the specimen was removed, and 2 mL MB was slowly injected into the isolated, stretched and fixed vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group C, no ACNS and MB were injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the mesentery lymph nodes were isolated and removed systematically by visually inspecting and palpating the adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference was observed among the three groups in age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter, T-stage, degree of differentiation, postoperative complications and peritoneal drainage retention time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total number of detected lymph nodes was 535, 476 and 223 in the three groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean number of detected lymph nodes per patient was significantly higher in group A than in group C (26.8 ± 8.4 vs 12.2 ± 3.2, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there were significantly more lymph nodes detected in group B than in group C (23.8 ± 6.9 vs 12.2 ± 3.2, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference between group A and group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 50, 46 and 32 metastatic lymph nodes dissected in 13 patients of group A, 10 patients of group B and 11 patients of group C, without significant differences among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 60 patients had insufficient number of detected lymph nodes (&lt; 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only one patient with T(4a) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> had 10 lymph nodes detected in group B, the other 10 patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Based on the different diameter categories, the number of detected lymph nodes in groups A and B was significantly higher than in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, there was no statistically significant difference between group A and group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The metastatic lymph nodes were not significant different among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, T stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation did not affect the staining results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Body mass index was a minor influencing factor in the two different staining methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The stained lymph nodes can easily be identified from the mesenteric adipose tissues, and the staining time for lymph nodes was not significantly different compared with unstained group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in groups A and B had drug-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both activated carbon nanoparticles suspension in vivo and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> in vitro can be used as tracers to increase the detected number of lymph nodes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
