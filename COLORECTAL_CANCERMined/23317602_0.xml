<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been conflicting evidence regarding negative effects of blood transfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine any negative effects of specific blood product transfusion after resection of hepatic colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (CRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective review of patients undergoing hepatectomy for CRM from 1995 to 2009 at a single institution was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific attention was paid to the effect of blood transfusion within 30 days of operation on overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To mitigate the bias introduced by complications that require blood transfusion to treat, only nonbleeding complications were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was analyzed according to Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 239 patients included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 64 (26.8%) receiving a transfusion of any kind with 25.5 per cent getting red cells (PRBCs), 7.11 per cent getting fresh-frozen plasma, and 3.77 per cent getting platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed only PRBC transfusion to be independently associated with nonbleeding complications (odds ratio, 1.980; 95% confidence interval, 1.094 to 3.582; P = 0.0239) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant adverse effect of transfusion with any product on overall or DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PRBC transfusion appears to increase the risk of postoperative complications; thus, strategies to minimize blood use may be warranted </plain></SENT>
