<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To facilitate the understanding of diagnostic errors in real-world primary care settings that use electronic health records (EHRs), this study explored the use of the situational awareness (SA) framework from aviation human factors research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mixed-methods study was conducted involving reviews of EHR data followed by semi-structured interviews of selected providers from two institutions in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population included 380 consecutive patients with colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancers</z:e> diagnosed between February 2008 and January 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a pre-tested data collection instrument, trained physicians identified diagnostic errors, defined as lack of timely action on one or more established indications for diagnostic work-up for lung and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six providers involved in cases with and without errors were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interviews probed for providers' lack of SA and how this may have influenced the diagnostic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 254 cases meeting inclusion criteria, errors were found in 30 of 92 (32.6%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> cases and 56 of 167 (33.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of interviews related to error cases revealed evidence of lack of one of four levels of SA applicable to primary care practice: information perception, information comprehension, forecasting future events, and choosing appropriate action based on the first three levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cases without error, application of the SA framework provided insight into processes involved in attention management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A framework of SA can help analyse and understand diagnostic errors in primary care settings that use EHRs </plain></SENT>
