<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the predictive value of a set of germline genetic polymorphisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with mFolfox-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: A total of 72 patients, comprising 50 men (69.4%) and 22 women (30.6%), were included after the signing of an informed consent form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 65.5 years (range: 32-80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants received mFolfox-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and genotyped by direct sequencing, SnapShot(®) and multiplex PCR techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight polymorphisms within six genes were investigated: TS 5´-UTR (variable number tandem repeat + G/C), TS 3´-UTR (TS1494del6); MTHFR C677T and A1298C; GSTP1 I105V; ERCC1 C118T; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln and XRCC1 Arg399Gln </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Association was evaluated by univariate analysis, and Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier assessed survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The local ethics committee approved the pharmacogenetic study protocol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects signed an informed consent before participating in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sample was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln was found to be significantly associated with a favorable progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median PFS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln patients (n = 33) was 16 months (95% CI: 9.2-22.7), 10 months (95% CI: 6.1-13.9) for Gln/Gln (n = 11) and 8 months (95% CI: 5.8-10.2) for Lys/Lys (n = 28), p = 0.019 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The increased risk of progression was: 1.93 (95% CI: 1.13-13.30; p = 0.017) for Lys/Lys and 2.1 (95% CI: 1.01-4.22; p = 0.047) for Gln/Gln </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with one or two Val alleles of GSTP1 tended to a lower risk of progression compared with Ile/Ile homozygotes, p = 0.067 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln and GSTP1 were analyzed jointly, patients who carried one or two favorable genotypes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln and Val, had a longer median PFS: 11 months (95% CI: 7.4-14.6) compared with six (95% CI: 4.6-7.4) with unfavorable genotypes, p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with mFolfox-6, the combination of haplotype <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln-GSTP1 105Val seems to predict the risk of progression </plain></SENT>
