<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Minimal lymph node involvement is a potential prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The International Union Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> deposits between 0.2 and 2 mm as micrometastases and clusters and single-cell infiltrations below this cutoff as isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, only a minority of studies discriminated metastatic involvements according to this definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to investigate the prognostic significance of micrometastases (0.2-2 mm), we performed a retrospective study enrolling 44 routinely diagnosed micrometastatic cases within 15 years which represent about 1 % of our cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases have been re-evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of the micrometastatic cases turned out to be macrometastases after step sectioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete follow-up was available in 33 remaining cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collections of node-negative and macrometastatic cases served as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier curves of macro- and micrometastatic cases showed a similar adverse course (p = 0.830) especially during the first 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year-survival rates were 51, 60 and 64 months for macro-, micrometastatic and node-negative cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference in overall survival, however, reached only a statistical trend and was not significant (p = 0.137) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After re-evaluation with step sections and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry out of an initial 91 node-negative cases, 11 (12 %) cases were identified with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells and one (1 %) case with a micrometastasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that micro- and macrometastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> show very similar survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, efforts to improve the detection of lymph node micrometastases seem to be justified </plain></SENT>
