<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The trial includes asymptomatic patients who are 50-79years and are not up-to-date with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who responded to a baseline telephone survey are randomized to a GERA or Control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GERA group participants meet with a nurse, decide whether to have a GERA blood test (a combination of genetic polymorphism and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>), and, if tested, receive GERA feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up telephone surveys are conducted at 1 and 6months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A chart audit is performed at 6months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2,223 eligible patients, 562 (25%) have enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who enrolled in the study were significantly younger than those who did not (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants tended to be 50-59years (64%), female (58%), white (52%), married (51%), and have more than a high school education (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At baseline, most participants had some knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and GERA, viewed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening favorably, and reported that they had decided to do screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Almost half had worries and concerns about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One in four eligible primary care patients enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age was negatively associated with enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prospective analyses using data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants will provide more definitive information on GERA uptake and the impact of GERA feedback </plain></SENT>
