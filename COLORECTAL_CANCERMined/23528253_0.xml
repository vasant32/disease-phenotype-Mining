<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In attempting to maximise the chance of surgical cure, surgeons and pathologists are now focussing upon the quality of oncological resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amongst pathological indices of interest, lymph node yield and the apical lymph node specifically are increasingly being shown to be reliable markers of the adequacy of oncologic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the position of the apical node in particular, is highly subjective and may not always correlate with the anatomical boundaries ultimately defining resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We argue that the present definition of the apical lymph node is overly subjective and requires re-defining based on fixed anatomical landmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that this new definition include a block of tissue inferolateral to the Trunk of Henle (the anatomical apical lymph node compartment) </plain></SENT>
