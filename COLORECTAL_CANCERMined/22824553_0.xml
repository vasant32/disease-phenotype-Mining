<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A literature search was performed using the Cochrane <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase and Science Citation Index Expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials comparing the Lichtenstein Mesh repair (LMR) with the Prolene <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>Hernia</z:hpo> System were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager Version 5.1 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome measures included surgical time, peri-operative complications, time to return to work, early and long-term postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six randomized clinical trials were identified as suitable, containing 1313 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between the two types of repair in operation time, time to return to work, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> groin pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> recurrence or long-term complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PHS group had a higher rate of peri-operative complications, compared to Lichtenstein mesh repair (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.93, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of PHS mesh was associated with an increased risk of peri-operative complications compared to LMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both mesh repair techniques have comparable short- and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
