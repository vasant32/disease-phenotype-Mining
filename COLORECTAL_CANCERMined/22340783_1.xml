<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This survey was intended to summarize the opinions of UK colorectal and liver surgeons on the specific issues pertaining to synchronous resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A validated electronic survey was sent to the consultant members of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) and the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons (AUGIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The questions were structured to allow direct comparison between the two groups of the responses obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-four specialist colorectal surgeons and 52 specialist hepatobiliary surgeons were identified from the register of their respective associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were obtained from 133 (31%) colorectal and 22 (42%) liver surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A majority of both groups of surgeons felt that synchronous resection was a valid therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A majority of both groups believed that synchronous resection was justified despite the options of laparoscopic surgery and enhanced recovery programmes for each discipline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Agreed possible advantages of synchronous resections were: a decrease in the overall length of hospital stay, cost and patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major concern about synchronous resections was an excessive overall physiological insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specific scenarios indicated that synchronous resection was favoured for major/complex major colorectal resection with minor liver resection or most colorectal resections not involving an anastomosis with either a minor or major liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although significant concerns relating to synchronous resection remain amongst colorectal and liver surgeons, a majority of them felt that synchronous resections could be offered to appropriately selected patients </plain></SENT>
