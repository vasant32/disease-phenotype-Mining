<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 270 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients over 75 years old who had undergone laparoscopy-assisted colectomy (LAC, 81 patients) or open colectomy (OC, 189 patients) between 2000 and 2009 were retrospectively analyzed regarding clinicopathological and surgery-related factors, perioperative course and pre- and postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> or smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were treated more frequently by LAC than by OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LAC tended to take a longer operative time but was similar to OC in terms of the degree of lymph node dissection and number of lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LAC group showed less blood loss, earlier ambulation, earlier eating and drinking, earlier passage of flatus and feces, a shorter hospital stay and lower postoperative leukocyte count (days 1 and 3) and CRP (day 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LAC group was similar to the OC group in preoperative complications (80.2% vs. 81.1%) but less postoperative complications (6.7% vs. 12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postoperative complications were mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">deliria</z:e> and respiratory complications, but there was no anastomotic leakage or operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LAC was relatively safe in elderly patients and is associated with earlier postoperative recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abdominal wall damage caused by surgery was considered one reason for the delay of patient recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LAC showed reduced damage and better postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate expanded indications of LAC for elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
