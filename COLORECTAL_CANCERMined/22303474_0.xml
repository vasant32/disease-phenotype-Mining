<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of exercise to reduce depressive symptoms among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined the extent to which exercise dose and clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors influence the relationship between exercise and reductions in depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a systematic search identifying randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions among adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors, examining depressive symptoms as an outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated effect sizes for each study and performed weighted multiple regression moderator analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 40 exercise interventions including 2,929 cancer survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diverse groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors were examined in seven exercise interventions; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors were examined in 26; <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were examined in two; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> survivors who completed an exercise intervention reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> more than controls, d(+) = -0.13 (95% CI: -0.26, -0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increases in weekly volume of aerobic exercise reduced depressive symptoms in dose-response fashion (β = -0.24, p = 0.03), a pattern evident only in higher quality trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exercise reduced depressive symptoms most when exercise sessions were supervised (β = -0.26, p = 0.01) and when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors were between 47-62 yr (β = 0.27, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exercise training provides a small overall reduction in depressive symptoms among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors but one that increased in dose-response fashion with weekly volume of aerobic exercise in high quality trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were reduced to the greatest degree among <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors, among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors aged between 47-62 yr, or when exercise sessions were supervised </plain></SENT>
