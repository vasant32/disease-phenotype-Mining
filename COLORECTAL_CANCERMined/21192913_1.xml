<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For instance, the susceptibility of human colonic mucosa to localized <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency may predispose to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a sensitive and robust ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) tandem mass spectrometry method for quantifying tissue H(4)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, 5-CH(3)-H(4)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-H(4)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, and 5,10-CH(+)-H(4)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human colonic mucosa (20-100mg) was extracted using lipase and conjugase enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rapid separation of analytes was achieved on a UHPLC 1.9-Î¼m C18 column over 7 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accurate quantitation was performed using stable isotopically labeled ((13)C(5)) internal standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The instrument response was linear over physiological concentrations of tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> (R(2)&gt;0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Limits of detection and quantitation were less than 20 and 30 fmol on column, respectively, and within- and between-run imprecision values were 6-16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In colonic mucosal samples from 73 individuals, the average molar distribution of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzymes</z:chebi> was 58% 5-CH(3)-H(4)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, 20% H(4)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, 18% formyl-H(4)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> (sum of 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-H(4)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and 5,10-CH(+)-H(4)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>), and 4% <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This assay would be useful in characterizing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> distribution in human and animal tissues as well as the role of deregulated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> homeostasis on disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
