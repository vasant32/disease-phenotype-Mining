<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study compared the outcome of prophylactic laparoscopic colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) with conventional open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A case-control study was carried out including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of proven FAP undergoing prophylactic laparoscopic colectomy with IRA between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2008 using a standardized technique within an enhanced recovery programme (ERAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controls were identified retrospectively from patients who underwent open prophylactic IRA before 31 March 2008 and were matched for age, gender, BMI and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included duration of surgery, complications, length of stay, readmission and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period 25 patients underwent laparoscopic IRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median operating time was longer in the laparoscopic group (235 vs 180 mins, P &lt; 0.0001) but the median hospital stay was shorter (6 vs 9 days, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall there were fewer complications in the laparoscopic group (20%vs 40%, P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic prophylactic colectomy with IRA in FAP is safe and feasible, and combined with ERAS leads to accelerated recovery and possibly fewer complications than open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FAP patients undergoing prophylactic IRA should be offered laparoscopic surgery </plain></SENT>
