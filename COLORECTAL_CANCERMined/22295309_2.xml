<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 110 tumour tissues and 40 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal specimens were examined by immunohistochemical staining (SP method) with VEGF-C and podoplanin (lymphatic vessel specific antibody) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LNM prediction sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of SVEGF-C were 85.7, 80.0 and 83.6%, respectively (875 pg/mL cut-off) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEGF-C expression was elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> versus control patients (P = 0.000), and was significantly related to LNM and pTNM stages III and IV </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LVD was significantly higher in LNM and pTNM stages III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SVEGF-C level was significantly higher in VEGF-C positive versus negative patients (P = 0.000), and was related to LVD (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan–Meier ranking of prognostic factors was SVEGF-C level (P = 0.000), VEGF-C expression (P = 0.001) and LVD (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SVEGF-C level, VEGF-C and LVD are related to LNM and poor prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
