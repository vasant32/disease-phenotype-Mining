<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common BRAF mutation is a valine-to-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transition (V600E) that is expressed primarily in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002890'>thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MEK/ERK is constitutively activated in the cells expressing BRAFV600E, leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development, invasion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, BRAFV600E is a therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and some other BRAFV600E <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vemurafenib, a BRAFV600E inhibitor, which was approved by FDA for the treatment of late-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> in 2011, produces improved rates of overall and progression-free survival in patients with the BRAFV600E mutation, making a dramatic breakthrough in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vemurafenib is also an individual target drug based on genetic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, its therapeutic success is limited by the emergence of drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to explore the mechanisms underlying the resistance for developing new inhibitor drugs and for preventing or delaying the resistance evolution to BRAF inhibitor drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this review, we described the role of BRAFV600E as an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> drug target and the development of BRAF inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also discussed the mechanisms leading to resistance of BRAFV600E inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, therapeutic strategies that might be employed to overcome acquired resistance were proposed </plain></SENT>
