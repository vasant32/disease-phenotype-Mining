<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of the few bacteria that have been consistently linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus gallolyticus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> with this bacterium are generally regarded as an indicator for colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, while the carriage rate of this bacterium in the healthy large intestine is relatively low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We speculated that the physiological changes accompanying the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> might favor the colonization of this bacterium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> cells can support the survival of S. gallolyticus, this bacterium was grown in spent medium of malignant colonocytes to simulate the altered metabolic conditions in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These in vitro simulations indicated that S. gallolyticus had a significant growth advantage in these spent media, which was not observed for other intestinal bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> responses were profiled by proteome analysis and metabolic shifts were analyzed by (1)H-NMR-spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In silico pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins and metabolite analysis indicated that this advantage resulted from the increased utilization of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> derivates, and alanine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell metabolites facilitate the survival of S. gallolyticus, favoring its local outgrowth and providing a possible explanation for the specific association of S. gallolyticus with colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
