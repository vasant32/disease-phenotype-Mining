<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In July 2001, PET became a covered service for Medicare beneficiaries when used for the diagnosis, staging, and restaging of non-small-cell lung, esophageal, colorectal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancers</z:e> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether physicians use PET as a replacement for or in addition to CT, MRI, or bone scintigraphy (BS) is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 20% sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged &gt; 64 years from 2004 through 2008 was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Annually for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type, a cohort of patients was created defined as having at least one admission with a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis or two nonhospital claims with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis â‰¥7 days apart per calendar year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each year, imaging claims and claim-days were counted by modality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequence of PET use was examined as before, after, or instead of other imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: About 125,000 beneficiaries (2.5% of the cohort) met the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> definition each year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2008, the combined annual imaging days per person-year were 2.3 for CT, 0.49 for MRI, 0.70 for PET, and 0.13 for BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual rates of imaging from 2004 to 2008 increased by 0.5% for CT, 3.2% for MRI, and 18.0% for PET (range, 14.6%-19.9% by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type) and decreased by 12.7% for BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The growth in PET use was not associated with meaningful changes in body CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 2007 and 2008, body CT preceded PET within 30 days in about half of patients, whereas PET preceded CT in only 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several years after its introduction, PET continued to grow rapidly, with evidence that it is replacing BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Growth of PET occurred without evidence of a decline in body CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>About half of PET use occurred shortly after body CT, suggesting an additive or final arbiter role </plain></SENT>
