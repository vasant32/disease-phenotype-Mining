<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This suggests that genetic changes in nonneoplastic mucosa might be effective markers for predicting the development of UC-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (UC-Ca) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to build a predictive model for the development of UC-Ca based on gene expression levels measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in nonneoplastic rectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three UC patients were examined, of which 10 had UC-Ca and 43 did not (UC-NonCa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the 40 genes and transcripts previously shown to be predictive for developing UC-Ca in our microarray studies, 149 new genes, reported to be important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, were selected for low density array (LDA) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of a total of 189 genes was examined by RT-PCR in nonneoplastic rectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 20 genes showing differential expression in UC-Ca and UC-NonCa patients, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes such as CYP27B1, RUNX3, SAMSN1, EDIL3, NOL3, CXCL9, ITGB2, and LYN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using these 20 genes, we were able to build a predictive model that distinguished patients with and without UC-Ca with a high accuracy rate of 83% and a negative predictive value of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This predictive model suggests that it is possible to identify UC patients at a high risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results have important implications for improving the efficacy of surveillance by colonoscopy and suggest directions for future research into the molecular mechanisms of UC-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
