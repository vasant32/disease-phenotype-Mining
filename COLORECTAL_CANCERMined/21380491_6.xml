<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that circadian genes participate in the growth and development of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the relations of circadian gene expression to clinicopathological factors and outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied surgical specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa obtained from 202 patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative expression levels of the circadian genes in the specimens were measured by quantitative real-time, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the Clock gene and the CKIε gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue were significantly higher compared to that in adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the Per1 and Per3 genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue was significantly lower compared to that in adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the relations between clinicopathological features and expression of the eight circadian genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue showed that high expression of the Bmal1 gene and low expression of the Per1 gene correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On analysis of the relations between outcomes and gene expression, high expression of the Per2 gene was associated with significantly better outcomes than low expression of the Per2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the Bmal1 gene and reduced expression of the Per1 gene may thus be useful predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, reduced expression of the Per2 gene may be a predictor of outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
