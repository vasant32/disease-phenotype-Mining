<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has a key role in the diagnostic strategy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> characterized by the presence of this phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability is therefore essential in the selection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in whom a germline analysis of Mismatch Repair genes is possibly indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, microsatellite instability <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> are associated with a good prognosis and a resistance to fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, which has a clinical application mainly in stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients in whom adjuvant chemotherapy has a less beneficial effect than in stage III and outcome in presence of microsatellite instability is excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that impact of microsatellite instability on benefit to fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy is dependent of the molecular mechanism involved in this genetic instability since an improved survival has been reported with adjuvant fluorouracil in microsatellite instability <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> of germline origin but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictive value of microsatellite instability on response to fluorouracil/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> adjuvant chemotherapy has been less evaluated but recent studies suggest that the favorable outcome of Microsatellite instability <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> is maintained in patients receiving FOLFOX </plain></SENT>
