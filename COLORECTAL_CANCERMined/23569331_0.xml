<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dramatically high social and economic impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> on human health makes the identification of a reliable screening tool of paramount importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current screening methods, such as the fecal occult blood test and colonoscopy do not adequately meet the ideal requisites of a screening test because, even if they are effective, they are limited first by too low specificity and sensitivity, or second by high invasiveness, costs and risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nowadays extended efforts are made by researchers to look for more reliable and effective screening tests based on a systems biology approach, using biological samples easily available, such as urine, breath, serum and feces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness and reliability of several new attempts to screen these patients by non-invasive analysis of their biological samples using genomic (genetic and epigenetic alteration), transcriptomic (miRNA), proteomic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related antigens, new antibodies against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigens, mutated proteins) and metabolomic (volatile organic metabolites) methods are discussed in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the most interesting new screening tools, fecal fluorescent long-DNA, fecal miRNA and metabolomic evaluation in breath and/or serum seem to be most promising </plain></SENT>
