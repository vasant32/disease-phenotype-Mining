<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of colonoscopy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Ontario provincial health data information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved average-risk persons aged 50 to 74 years from 1996 to 2000 who were alive and free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> on January 1, 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Colonoscopy between 1996 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality from 2001 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study cohort contained 1,089,998 persons, 7.9% of whom had undergone a colonoscopy between 1996 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using primary care physician rate of discretionary colonoscopy as an instrumental variable, the receipt of colonoscopy was associated with a 0.60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31%-0.78%) absolute reduction in the 7-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence and a 0.17% (95% CI, 0.14%-0.21%) absolute reduction in the 5-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to a 48% relative decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence (risk ratio [RR] 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34-0.76) and 81% decrease in mortality caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (RR 0.19, 95% CI, 0.07-0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses, the reduction in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was larger in women than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence was larger for complete colonoscopies and for left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Instrumental variable methods estimate only the marginal effect on the population studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased use of colonoscopy procedures is associated with a reduction in the incidence and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the population studied </plain></SENT>
