<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One scan was excluded as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reviewers felt it to be of insufficient quality to assess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improved surgical technique and better chemotherapeutic manipulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> has increased the number of patients eligible for potentially curative resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rapid evolution in this field suggests that non-specialist decision-making may lead to inappropriate management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the management of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> by non-liver surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent chemotherapy with palliative intent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> at a regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> centre between 1 January and 31 December 2009 were identified from a prospectively maintained local database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six resectional liver surgeons blinded to patient management and outcome reviewed pretreatment imaging and assigned each scan a score based on their own management choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A consensus decision was reached on the appropriateness of palliative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and ten patients were treated with palliative chemotherapy, of whom 53 had liver-only disease and had not been reviewed by a specialist liver surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One scan was excluded as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reviewers felt it to be of insufficient quality to assess [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> in 33 patients (63 per cent) were considered potentially resectable, with a high level of interobserver agreement (κ = 0 · 577) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When individual approach to management was considered, interobserver agreement was less marked (κ = 0 · 378) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Management of patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> without the involvement of a specialist liver multidisciplinary team can lead to patients being denied potentially curative treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Management of these patients must involve a specialist liver surgeon to ensure appropriate management </plain></SENT>
