<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line single-agent cetuximab in fit elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, as well as potential molecular predictive factors for efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: patients aged 70 or older with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> without criteria for frailty and no prior treatment for advanced disease were treated with single-agent cetuximab 400mg/m(2) followed by weekly 250mg/m(2) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: forty-one patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients achieved a complete response and 4 patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 14.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (36.6%) remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression was 2.9 months and median overall survival 11.1 months despite two-third of patients received chemotherapy at progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-five percent of EGFR gene copy number positive patients by FISH were progression-free at 12 weeks, in contrast with 12% of FISH negative patients (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 skin toxicity was reported in 5 patients (12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypersensitivity infusion reactions were not reported and there were no toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: cetuximab is a safe monoclonal antibody with moderate activity in first-line <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, but the present study does not support the use of cetuximab as single-agent in first-line fit elderly patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
