<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The DNA-damaging drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (Dox) induces cell senescence at concentrations significantly lower than those required for induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At low Dox concentrations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor p53 is activated, which enhances the expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1) (p21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At high concentrations, Dox activates p53 leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> without enhancing p21 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms and factors that govern the differential effects of Dox in inducing senescence and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) DNMT3a was upregulated by Dox especially at concentrations that induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, and this process was regulated by p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, p21 expression was significantly upregulated at senescence-inducing concentrations and kept low on treatment with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing concentrations of Dox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differential expression of DNMT3a and p21 in response to Dox suggests that DNMT3a may be a key factor in switches between Dox-induced senescence and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when DNMT3a was silenced, treatment of HCT116 cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing concentration of Dox increased the percentage of cells undergoing senescence, accompanied by upregulation of p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrarily, senescence-inducing concentration of Dox promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate, and p21 expression was repressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, no changes in DNA methylation status at p21 promoter were detected at either ranges of Dox, although DNMT3a and HDAC1 were recruited to p21 promoter at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing Dox concentration, where they were present in the same complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data demonstrate that DNMT3a impacts the expression of p21 and plays a role in determining the Dox-induced senescence and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
