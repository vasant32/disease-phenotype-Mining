<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to detect the role of OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in a Kashmiri population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the genotype distribution of the OGG1 gene in 114 CRC cases in comparison with 200 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but the homozygous Cys/Cys variant genotype was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the OGG1 polymorphism is not associated with the risk of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Kashmiri population in general but modulates the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development in colon via interaction with many dietary factors </plain></SENT>
