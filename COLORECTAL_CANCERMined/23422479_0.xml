<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In regard to the protective effects of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> however, evidence from epidemiological studies is inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study we investigated the fatty acid composition in plasma, red blood cells (RBCs) and adipose tissue from Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, or benign disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-one patients with histologically-confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 42 patients with non-malignant disease were recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fatty acid composition of the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PL) fraction of plasma and washed RBCs was determined by gas chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fatty acid composition of the triacylglycerol (TAG) fraction of subcutaneous adipose tissue was determined in a similar manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> proportion in the plasma and RBC PL fractions was significantly lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than in the controls (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="48010">LNA</z:chebi> proportion in the RBC PL fraction was lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, but no changes were found in the plasma PL fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">Arachidonic acid</z:chebi> was the only PUFA in the adipose TAG fraction that exhibited significant differences, with higher levels in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> have abnormalities in PUFAs in the plasma PL, erythrocyte PL, and adipose TAG fractions </plain></SENT>
