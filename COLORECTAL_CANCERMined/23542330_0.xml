<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the cost-effectiveness of a hybrid screening strategy, based on a fecal immunological test (FIT) and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using the Archimedes Model to evaluate the effects of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening strategies on health outcomes and costs related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a population that represents members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Archimedes Model is a large-scale simulation of human <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, diseases, interventions, and health care systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> submodel in the Archimedes Model was derived from public databases, published epidemiologic studies, and clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A hybrid screening strategy led to substantial reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality, gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and reductions in costs, comparable to those of the best single-test strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening by annual FIT of patients 50-65 years old and a then a single colonoscopy when they are 66 years old (FIT/COLO x1) reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence by 72% and gained 110 QALYs for every 1000 people over a period of 30 years, compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with annual FIT, FIT/COLOx1 gained 1,400 QALYs/100,000 persons, at an incremental cost of $9,700/QALY gained, and required 55% fewer FITs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with FIT/COLOx1, colonoscopy at 10-year intervals gained 500 QALYs/100,000 at an incremental cost of $35,100/QALY gained, but required 37% more colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over the ranges of parameters examined, the cost-effectiveness of hybrid screening strategies was slightly more sensitive to the adherence rate with colonoscopy than the adherence rate with yearly FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Uncertainties associated with estimates of FIT performance within a program setting and sensitivities for flat and right-sided lesions are expected to have significant impacts on the cost-effectiveness results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our simulation model, a strategy of annual or biennial FIT, beginning when patients are 50 years old, with a single colonoscopy when they are 66 years old, delivers clinical and economic outcomes similar to those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening by single-modality strategies, with a favorable impact on resources demand </plain></SENT>
