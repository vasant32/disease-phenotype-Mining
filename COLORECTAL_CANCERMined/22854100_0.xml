<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and stress are associated with raised inflammatory marker levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients focuses on childhood trauma, recent life events and inflammatory marker levels as risk factors for high post-surgery depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients (56 head and neck, 34 colorectal) completed the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale, pre-surgery and six, 12 and 24 weeks post-surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent life events and childhood trauma were assessed at six and 12 weeks respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken pre- and one and six weeks post-surgery to measure C-reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Childhood trauma and recent life events were risk factors for higher depressive symptom levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, baseline CRP levels were associated with depressive symptom levels at six (p=0.008) and 12 weeks (p=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline and six week <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>Necrosis</z:mp> Factor-alpha (TNFα) levels were significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms at later time points after adjusting for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Childhood trauma was positively associated with TNFα and CRP levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The associations between inflammatory markers and depressive symptoms were not significant after adjusting for childhood trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Raised inflammatory mediator levels may be risk factors for depressive symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and thus worth considering as a potential therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These pilot data support recent findings demonstrating long-term effects of childhood adversity on adult health </plain></SENT>
