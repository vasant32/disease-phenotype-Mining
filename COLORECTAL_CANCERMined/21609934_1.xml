<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 350 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278535" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage I rectal cancer</z:e>, in which 283 cases (80.9%) received SR, and 67 cases (19.1%) received LE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival analyses were performed to compare outcomes of different surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year local recurrence (LR) rate was 14.1% in LE group versus 3.3% in SR group (P= .0004), and the 10-year overall survival (OS) rate was not significantly different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis suggested that LE was an independent risk factor for 5-year LR rate and 10-year OS rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> grade was found related to 5-year LR, and T stage was found related to 10-year OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size of 2.5 cm is found as a possible cut-off for predicting 5-year LR rate in LE group, with a sensitivity of 77.8% and a specificity of 75.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with LE, the 5-year LR rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> â‰¥ 2.5 cm was 40%, compared with 4.3% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> &lt; 2.5 cm (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Local excision in early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> may result in high local recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The procedure is only recommended in highly selective groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size of 2.5 cm is a useful criterion for choosing LE rather than SR </plain></SENT>
