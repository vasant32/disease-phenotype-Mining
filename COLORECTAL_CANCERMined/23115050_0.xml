<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of hypomethylation in particular of non-CpG island genes is much less well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By genome-wide screening, we identified 105 genes in microsatellite stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with an inverse correlation (Spearman's ρ ≤ -0.40) between methylation and expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 35 (33%) were hypomethylated non-CpG island genes and two of them, APOLD1 (Spearman's ρ = -0.82) and SRPX2 (Spearman's ρ = -0.80) were selected for further analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypomethylation of both genes were localized events not shared by adjacent genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A set of 662 FFPE DNA samples not only confirmed that APOLD1 and SRPX2 are hypomethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> but also revealed hypomethylation to be significantly (p &lt; 0.01) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> being localized in the left side, CpG island methylator phenotype negative, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>, BRAF wt, undifferentiated and of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> histosubtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demethylation experiments supported SRPX2 being epigenetically regulated via DNA methylation, whereas other mechanisms in addition to DNA methylation seem to be involved in the regulation of APOLD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further identified miR-149 as a potential novel post-transcriptional regulator of SRPX2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissue, miR-149 was downregulated and inversely correlated to SRPX2 (ρ = -0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-149 significantly reduced SRPX2 transcript levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study highlights that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, hypomethylation of non-CpG island-associated promoters deregulate gene expression nearly as frequent as do CpG-island hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The hypomethylation of SRPX2 is focal and not part of a large block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it often translates to an increased expression level, which may be modulated by miR-149 </plain></SENT>
