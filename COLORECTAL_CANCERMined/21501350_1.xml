<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying benefits and barriers requires consideration of specific characteristics of screening modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS: To monitor the impact of providing information about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening via faecal occult blood testing (FOBt) on intentions to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate moderation by individual differences in consideration of future consequences (CFC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 211 healthy adults (aged 45-59) with no experience of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were presented with eight consecutive statements about FOBt-based screening in a web survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants completed measures of i) intention (after each statement), ii) CFC and iii) the importance of screening practicalities (e.g. unpleasantness of completing the test) and benefits (e.g. early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An 8 (information)Ã—2 (CFC) mixed ancova showed that intentions varied across the eight statements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(P&lt;0.001): increasing after information about FOBt being completed at home (P&lt;0.001) before subsequently decreasing after information about the requirement to collect faecal samples (P&lt;0.001) in a plastic tub (P&lt;0.01) on three occasions (P&lt;0.01) with the low CFC group generally being less inclined to complete the test (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two between-group anovas demonstrated that the low CFC group attributed greater importance to practicalities of screening than the high CFC group while the opposite was found for the importance of benefits (both P's&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deconstructing FOBt-based screening pointed to specific benefits and barriers which can advance research into public preferences of screening and educational materials </plain></SENT>
