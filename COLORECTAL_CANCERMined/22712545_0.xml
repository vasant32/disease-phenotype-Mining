<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to validate the need for annual surveillance for colon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients ≤45 of age with a combined diagnosis of PSC and IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We identified patients, ≤45 years of age with a combined diagnosis of PSC and IBD, who were seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1995 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then reviewed the medical records of the patients who developed colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-associated lesion or mass (DALM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:  In the population of 784 patients ≤45 years of age with a combined diagnosis of PSC and IBD, 10 (1.3%) of 784 developed colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, one had HGD and two had a DALM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is uncommon in young patients (≤45 years of age) with a combined diagnosis of PSC and IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest delaying surveillance in young patients and propose that studies should be carried out to clarify the cost-effectiveness of annual or biannual surveillance colonoscopies according to patient age </plain></SENT>
