<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the clinical and immune impact of fast-track surgery in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients undergoing elective open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 2008 to January 2009 with a 1-month postdischarge follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 70 patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> requiring colorectal resection were randomized into two groups: a fast-track group (35 cases) and a conventional care group (35 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> included patients underwent elective open colorectal resection with combined tracheal intubation and general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters and markers of immune function were evaluated in both groups postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 62 patients completed the study: 32 in the fast-track group and 30 in the conventional care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings revealed a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay and faster return of gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing fast-track rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found a quicker response of white blood cells in the fast-track group than in the conventional care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found that blood levels of globulin, immunoglobulin G, and complement 4 on postoperative day 3 were higher in the fast-track group than in the conventional care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fast-track surgery accelerates clinical recovery and improves postoperative immunity after elective open surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
