<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> initiates the organism's innate immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery reduces the trauma, and patients benefit from diminished surgical trauma and maintained immune function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytokine levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) are related to the magnitude of surgical trauma and surgical stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 are the first sensor-recognition receptors of the invading pathogens for the innate immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to compare the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and then the stress response during laparoscopic and open colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by calculating TLR-2 and TLR-4 as the first sensor-recognition receptors together with interleukin-6 (IL-6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α), and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomized in two groups: group A (open colectomy, n = 20) and group B (laparoscopic colectomy, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An epidural catheter was placed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients 1 h preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rupivocaine was administered perioperatively and 48 h postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken for calculation of IL-6, TNF-α, hsCRP, TLR-2, and TLR-4 preoperatively and 5 min after deflation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> (group B) or 5 min after division of the colon (group A), then 6 and 24 h postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean operative time was 115 for group A and 142 min for group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean blood loss was respectively 240 and 105 ml (P &lt; 0.001), and the mean hospital stay was respectively 8 and 5 days (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The IL-6 level was significant higher in group A than in group B at 6 and 24 h postoperatively (P &lt; 0.0001), and the hsCRP level was significant higher in group A than in group B at 24 h postoperatively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The TNF-α values did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The TLR-2 level was significantly higher in group A than in group B at 5 min (P = 0.013) and 24 h (P = 0.007) postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The TLR-4 level was significant higher in group A than in group B at 5 min postoperatively (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and the resultant stress response are significantly less during laparoscopic colectomy than during open colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This is an obvious short-term clinical benefit for the patient, providing tinder for further study to investigate the long-term results of laparoscopic colectomy versus open colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
