<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Improvements can be made in the quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care if supportive care needs are addressed; however, there are few trials of supportive care interventions to guide policy and practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a nurse-delivered telephone supportive intervention (the "CONNECT" intervention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intervention group patients received 5 calls from a specialist colorectal nurse in the 6 months after hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each call was standardized, comprising the assessment of unmet need and the provision of information and emotional support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONNECT was in addition to standard clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients allocated to the control group received standard follow-up only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study took place at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n = 75) were included who had been surgically treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (any stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were the unmet supportive care needs, health service utilization, and quality of life at 1, 3, and 6 months postdischarge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 87 eligible patients, 75 consented (86% consent rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients were randomly assigned to CONNECT and 36 to usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, there was a clinically relevant, but nonsignificant reduction in presentations to emergency departments (21% vs 33%; χ1 = 1.41, P = .23) and readmission to the hospital (37% vs 47%; χ1 = 0.82, P = .37) among intervention compared with control group participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nonsignificant differences between groups were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unmet supportive care need and quality-of-life scores, change scores, and trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, at 6 months, total quality-of-life scores were higher for intervention group patients than controls (106.0 vs 98.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This difference (7.4) was clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Improvements in total quality-of-life change scores demonstrated that at 6 months, improvements were more than twice as large and clinically significant in the intervention compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CONNECT has shown promising indications on health system and patient outcomes that warrant a larger study to further investigate the potential of this intervention </plain></SENT>
