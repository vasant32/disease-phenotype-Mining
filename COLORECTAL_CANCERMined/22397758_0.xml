<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> markedly limits the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was performed to assess the efficacy of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) for preventing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> induced neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> based chemotherapy (FOLFOX or XELOX) were retrospectively divided into two groups according to the use of GM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of neurotoxicity and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 278 cases were included, 114 in GM1 group and 164 in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly lower incidence of grade 1-3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity (81% vs 92%, p=0.006), grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity (26% vs 45%, p=0.002) was observed in GM1 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, incidence of grade 1-3 (30% vs 48%, p=0.003) and grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurotoxicity (4% vs 13%, p=0.021) was also lower in GM1 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference was detected in objective response rate, progress free survival, and median overall survival between GM1 group and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The retrospective study demonstrated that GM1 significantly reduced the incidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, especially severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, without impairment of efficacy </plain></SENT>
