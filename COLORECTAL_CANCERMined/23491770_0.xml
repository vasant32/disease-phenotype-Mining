<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected in a multicenter trial conducted in the Netherlands, in which 6600 asymptomatic men and women between 50 and 75 years were randomly selected from a population registry </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on a review of the literature <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Information on risk factors was obtained from screening attendees through a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factor, we estimated its odds ratio (OR) relative to the presence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> as detected at colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 1426 screening participants who underwent a colonoscopy, 1236 (86%) completed the risk questionnaire </plain></SENT>
