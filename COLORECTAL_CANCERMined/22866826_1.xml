<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 55 patients revealing submucosal invasive colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> on pathology who underwent curative radical resection at the Department of Surgery, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vincent's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea from January 2007 to September 2010 were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size, depth of submucosal invasion, histologic grade, lymphovascular invasion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding, and microacinar structure were reviewed by a single pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Student t-test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables were used for comparing the clinicopathological features between two groups (whether lymph node involvement existed or not) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous variables are expressed as the mean ± standard error while statistical significance is accepted at P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of 55 patients (34 males and 21 females) was 61.2 ± 9.6 years (range, 43-83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, eight (14.5%) patients had metastatic lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding (P = 0.047) was the only factor that was significantly associated with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding had a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 60.5%, and a negative predictive value of 0.958 for lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in submucosal invasive T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding seems to have a high sensitivity (83.3%), acceptable specificity (60.5%), and a high negative predictive value (0.958) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A close examination of pathologic finding including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding should be performed in order to manage early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> properly </plain></SENT>
