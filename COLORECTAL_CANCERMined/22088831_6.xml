<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is widely recommended, but the preferred strategy remains unidentified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare participation and diagnostic yield between screening with colonoscopy and with non-cathartic CT colonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Members of the general population, aged 50-75 years, and living in the regions of Amsterdam or Rotterdam, identified via the registries of the regional municipal administration, were randomly allocated (2:1) to be invited for primary screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by colonoscopy or by CT colonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was done per household with a minimisation algorithm based on age, sex, and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Invitations were sent between June 8, 2009, and Aug 16, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants assigned to CT colonography who were found to have one or more large lesions (≥10 mm) were offered colonoscopy; those with 6-9 mm lesions were offered surveillance CT colonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the participation rate, defined as number of invitees undergoing the examination relative to the total number of invitees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic yield was calculated as number of participants with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> relative to the total number of invitees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Invitees and screening centre employees were not masked to allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered in the Dutch trial register, number NTR1829 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 1276 (22%) of 5924 colonoscopy invitees participated, compared with 982 (34%) of 2920 CT colonography invitees (relative risk [RR] 1·56, 95% CI 1·46-1·68; p&lt;0·0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the participants in the colonoscopy group, 111 (9%) had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of whom seven (&lt;1%) had a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of CT colonography participants, 84 (9%) were offered colonoscopy, of whom 60 (6%) had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of whom five (&lt;1%) had a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; 82 (8%) were offered surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was 8·7 per 100 participants for colonoscopy versus 6·1 per 100 for CT colonography (RR 1·46, 95% CI 1·06-2·03; p=0·02) and 1·9 per 100 invitees for colonoscopy and 2·1 per 100 invitees for CT colonography (RR 0·91, 0·66-2·03; p=0·56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of 10 mm or more was 1·5 per 100 invitees for colonoscopy and 2·0 per 100 invitees for CT colonography, respectively (RR 0·74, 95% CI 0·53-1·03; p=0·07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events related to the screening procedure were post-polypectomy <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp>: two in the colonoscopy group and three in the CT colonography group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening with CT colonography was significantly better than with colonoscopy, but colonoscopy identified significantly more advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> per 100 participants than did CT colonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> per 100 invitees was similar for both strategies, indicating that both techniques can be used for population-based screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Other factors such as cost-effectiveness and perceived burden should be taken into account when deciding which technique is preferable </plain></SENT>
