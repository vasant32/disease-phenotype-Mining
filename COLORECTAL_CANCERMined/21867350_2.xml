<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to analyse the characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in elderly patients and to assess the outcomes of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: the study included 1,924 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during a 22 year period (1985-2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed patient clinical and demographic characteristics as well as their treatment and its outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: there was an increase in emergency surgery with age, increasing from 13% among patients under 80 years of age to 47% in those over 90 years of age (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the overall percentage of patients who underwent surgical treatment decreased from 96% in patients younger than 80 years of age, to 85% and 59% in octogenarians and nonagenarians, respectively (p = 0.0001), and there was a similar pattern in the rates of curative surgery among patients who underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality of patients who underwent surgery was 8% (141 out of 1,769), increasing from 4% in patients younger than 70 years of age to 25% in those over 90 (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the factors associated with mortality were the emergency nature of the surgery (p = 0.001), the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade (p = 0.0001), and the presence of systemic complications (p = 0.0001), the weight of age decreasing significantly with respect to the univariate analysis (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: there is an increase in the rate of complicated forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with increasing age of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is a dramatic decrease in the rate of curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> resection with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative mortality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in octogenarians and nonagenarians is more closely related to the nature and intent of the surgery (elective or emergency; palliative or curative), the perioperative risk (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade), and severe systemic complications, than to age </plain></SENT>
