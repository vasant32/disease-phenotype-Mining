<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677947" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage I colorectal cancer</z:e> show an excellent prognosis, a few of them die of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this subgroup of individuals, the search of occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> might reveal that early dissemination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells could be the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Through a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, we selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with Stage I disease who died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e>; a total of 32 patients were identified and in 25 of them paraffin-embedded material was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The group was matched to 70 Stage I patients with favorable prognosis (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases and controls resected lymph nodes were cut, and micrometastases were searched using pan-cytokeratin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Micrometastases were detected in 18 of 25 (72%) Stage I patients who died of the disease, while they were almost absent among controls (1 of 70, p &lt; 0.001 by Ï‡(2) test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding were more frequent among Stage I patients with an unfavorable prognosis than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By regression analyses, micrometastases (HR 12.3, CI 4.8-32) and vascular invasion (HR 3.5, CI 1.4-8.5) maintained an independent association with prognosis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Micrometastasis in the lymph nodes can be revealed in the majority of patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who die of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, while they appear extremely rare in Stage I individuals with good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The selection of patients through histology (vascular invasion) and search of occult metastatic cells might represent a way to identify individuals who might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
