<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To identify the time taken from referral to first treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in the Auckland region and benchmark these against available guidelines for timeliness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective study of clinical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> identified from the national registry and Auckland regional databases in the years 2001 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data extracted included demographics, dates and types of interventions and the patient journey from referral to initiation of first treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1128 patients diagnosed and treated in these cohorts, 68% were referred through their general practitioner and 58% saw a surgeon at their first specialist appointment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine percent received initial treatment with curative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time from initial referral to first treatment was 35 days, with only 68% of patients being treated within 62 days of initial referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The colorectal patient journey is complicated by multiple pathways of presentation and treatment and by patient choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These factors need to be considered when assessing the acceptability of transit times based on summary data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>That nearly one-third of patients did not complete the United Kingdom-based target of 62 days from referral to first treatment indicates there is a need for further improvement in service delivery for patients developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Auckland region </plain></SENT>
