<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU), leucovorin (L), and bevacizumab (B), and preliminary data of cetuximab + bevacizumab, and toxicity profiles suggests that FOLF-CB (5-FU, L, C+B) may have activity with a favorable toxicity profile as first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized at registration to either arm A (mFOLFOX6-B) (modified, 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>L (folinic acid), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (O) + bevacizumab), administered days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle as bevacizumab 5 mg/kg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 85 mg/m(2), leucovorin 400 mg/m(2), and 5-FU 400 mg/m(2) then 1200 mg/m(2)/day for 48 hours, or arm B (FOLF-CB), which included bevacizumab, leucovorin, and 5-FU as in arm A and cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) day 1 cycle 1; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other weekly cetuximab doses were 250 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred forty-seven patients (arm A/arm B 124/123) were enrolled, and 239 were treated (118/121) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 45%/32%, objective response rates (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) were 52%/41%, disease control rates (CR+PR+stable disease [SD]) were 87%/83%, and median overall survival (OS) was 21/19.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was higher in arm A (28%/7%), as was grade 3 <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (12%/3%), and grade 3 neuropathy (11%/&lt; 1%), whereas acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> was confined to arm B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of KRAS mutational status did not demonstrate KRAS as a meaningful determinant of activity, except in arm B patients with KRAS-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, which resulted in inferior PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient satisfaction favored the control (mFOLFOX6-B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FOLF-CB was not superior to mFOLFOX6-B in terms of 12-month PFS and ORR, and was not more acceptable to patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This trial supports the conclusion of other recently reported trials that concurrent cetuximab+bevacizumab should not be routinely used in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
