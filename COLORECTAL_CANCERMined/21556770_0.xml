<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that PNAS-4 is a p53 down-stream target gene and designed this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched online for putative p53-binding sites in the entire PNAS-4 gene and did not find any corresponding information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In HCT116 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, after being transfected with small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> to silence p53, the expressions of PNAS-4 and other known p53 target gene (Apaf1, Bax, Fas and Dr5) were determined by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that PNAS-4 was up-regulated while Apaf1, Bax, Fas and Dr5 were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then examined the expression of PNAS-4 and p53 mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PNAS-4 expressed both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, but compared with paired control, PNAS-4 was up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PNAS-4 overexpression ratios were correlated to the p53 mutant status (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean PNAS-4 expression levels of p53 mutant homozygote group and heterozygote group were higher than that of p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> group (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression ratios of PNAS-4 (every sample in relative to its paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa) were different between negative lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (66% up-regulated, 34% down-regulated) and positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (42% up-regulated, 58% down-regulated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggested that PNAS-4 was not a p53 target, but overexpression of PNAS-4 was correlated to p53 inactivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
