<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Only 30% to 40% of patients with advanced proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (APN) have distal colon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a risk score model for APN and propose an individualized screening protocol for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Derivation cohort (6200 adults) and validation cohort (1389 adults) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: An APN risk score model was developed from the derivation cohort (6200 adults) and was tested in the validation cohort (1389 adults), who underwent screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, male sex, and smoking were clinical risk factors for APN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of a distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was a sigmoidoscopic risk factor for APN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We calculated APN risk scores (0-8) based on these variables and classified patients as low risk (0-2) or high risk (3-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the validation cohort, the relative risk of APN was 3.5-fold higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our model suggests that colonoscopy should be performed as an initial screening test in patients with a high clinical risk for APN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sigmoidoscopy should be performed initially in patients with low clinical risk for APN followed by supplementary colonoscopy in those with high APN risk scores based on both clinical and sigmoidoscopic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This protocol detected APN in 22 of 34 APN+ patients (64.7%) with little increase in the endoscopy burden, whereas only 16 of 34 APN+ patients (47.1%) would be identified by initial sigmoidoscopy followed by colonoscopy only in cases with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our APN risk score model provides an algorithm for efficient screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
