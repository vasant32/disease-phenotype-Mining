<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A robotic system (da Vinci(Â®) Surgical System, Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) has technical advantages over conventional laparoscopic surgery because it increases the precision and accuracy of anatomical dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to compare the short-term outcomes between robot-assisted intersphincteric resection (ISR) and laparoscopic ISR for distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who underwent robot- or laparoscopy-assisted ISR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> between March 2008 and July 2011 were included in this retrospective comparative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perioperative and postoperative data, including complications and early functional outcomes, were analyzed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Wexner scoring system, the International Prostate Symptom Score, and the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 40 patients underwent robot-assisted and 40 underwent laparoscopic ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean operative time was significantly longer in the robotic group than in the laparoscopic group (235.5 vs. 185.4 min; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transabdominal ISR, in which intersphincteric dissection is completed in the pelvic cavity, was performed more with robotic assistance than with laparoscopic surgery (8 vs. 2 cases; p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between groups regarding postoperative morbidity and pathological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The robot-assisted group showed a trend toward less postoperative blood loss and early recovery of functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted surgery was safe and effective for ISR of distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and showed surgical outcomes similar to those of the latest laparoscopic ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The favorable results of the robot-assisted ISR included reduced adaptation time, alleviated difficulty of perineal phase, and early recovery of functional outcomes in this analysis of short-term clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
