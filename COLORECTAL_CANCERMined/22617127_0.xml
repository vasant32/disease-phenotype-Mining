<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: KRAS mutations are predictive markers for the efficacy of anti-EGFR antibody therapies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the mutational status of KRAS is reportedly highly concordant between primary and metastatic lesions, it is not yet clear whether genotoxic chemotherapies might induce additional mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 63 lesions (23 baseline primary, 18 metastatic and 24 post-treatment metastatic) from 21 patients who were treated with FOLFOX as adjuvant therapy for stage III/IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> following curative resection were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA samples were obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens, and KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant KRAS codons 12 and 13 were 8 and 13, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutational status of KRAS remained concordant between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> and the post-FOLFOX metastatic lesions, irrespective of patient background, treatment duration and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mutational statuses of the other genes evaluated were also concordant between the primary and metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because the mutational statuses of predictive biomarker genes were not altered by FOLFOX therapy, specimens from both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> and post-FOLFOX <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> might serve as valid sources of DNA for known genomic biomarker testing </plain></SENT>
