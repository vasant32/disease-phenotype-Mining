<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we showed that loss-of-function mutations in lin-4 microRNA increased axon attraction mediated by the netrin homolog UNC-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absence of lin-4 microRNA suppressed the axon guidance defects of anterior ventral microtubule (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) neurons caused by loss-of-function mutations in slt-1, which encodes a repulsive guidance cue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective expression of lin-4 microRNA in <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> neurons of lin-4-null animals indicated that the effect of lin-4 on <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> axon guidance was cell-autonomous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Promoter reporter analysis suggested that lin-4 was likely expressed strongly in <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> neurons during the developmental time frame that the axons are guided to their targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the lin-4 reporter was barely detectable in anterior lateral microtubule (ALM) neurons, axon guidance of which is insensitive to netrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> neurons, the transcription factor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LIN</z:e>-14, a target of lin-4 microRNA, stimulated UNC-6-mediated ventral guidance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> axon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LIN</z:e>-14 promoted attraction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> axon through the UNC-6 receptor UNC-40 [the worm homolog of vertebrate Deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>)] and its cofactor MADD-2, which signals through both the UNC-34 (Ena) and the <z:chebi fb="50" ids="3547">CED</z:chebi>-10 (Rac1) downstream pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LIN</z:e>-14 stimulated UNC-6-mediated axon attraction in part by increasing UNC-40 abundance </plain></SENT>
