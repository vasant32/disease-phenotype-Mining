<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the miRNA-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> regulatory network is far from being fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the expression and the biological roles of miR-330 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cdc42, one of the best characterized members of the Rho GTPase family, was found to be up-regulated in several types of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> initiation and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we identified miR-330, as a potential regulator of Cdc42, was found to be inversely correlated with Cdc42 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of miR-330 down-regulated Cdc42 expression at both protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, mimicked the effect of Cdc42 knockdown in inhibiting proliferation, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, whereas restoration of Cdc42 could partially attenuate the effects of miR-330 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, elevated expression of miR-330 could suppress the immediate downstream effectors of Cdc42 and inhibit the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To sum up, our results establish a role of miR-330 in negatively regulating Cdc42 expression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They suggest that manipulating the expression level of Cdc42 by miR-330 has the potential to influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
