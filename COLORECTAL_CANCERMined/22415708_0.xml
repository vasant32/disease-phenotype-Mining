<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors of the current report studied a population-based sample of privately insured, Medicaid-insured, and uninsured inpatients ages 21 to 64 years who underwent surgical resection for either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">nonsmall cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>) (n = 781) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) (n = 8190) or who underwent mastectomy (n = 6201) to compare length of stay and inpatient costs by insurance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for this study were derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> civilian, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-care hospitals in Virginia from 1999 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical generalized linear models were used to estimate the relation between the explanatory variables and lengths of stay and costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> analyses controlled for patient characteristics and hospital random effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Medicaid-insured patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> had longer lengths of stay (39% or 2.64 days longer) and higher inpatient costs (20% or $2479 higher costs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Uninsured and Medicaid-insured patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had longer lengths of stay and higher inpatient costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, uninsured patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> had 11% shorter lengths of stay and 12% lower inpatient costs than privately insured patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medicaid-insured patients had 10% lower inpatient costs than privately insured patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences were no longer statistically significant when reconstruction was added to the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Health insurance affected the need for health care and the amount of health care received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Uninsured and Medicaid-insured patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> who underwent resection had longer lengths of stay and higher inpatient costs than privately insured patients, but they had shorter lengths of stay when reconstruction was not provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, patients and/or providers economized on discretionary procedures </plain></SENT>
