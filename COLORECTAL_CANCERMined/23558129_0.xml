<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was surgically resected, and he thereafter underwent chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He complained of gingival swelling throughout treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the jaw was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bevacizumab therapy was therefore discontinued and the necrotic tissue removed </plain></SENT>
