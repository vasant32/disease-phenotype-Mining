<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relevance of NOCs in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) development, we analyzed whole genome gene expression modifications in human colon biopsies in relation to fecal NOC exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We had a particular interest in patients suffering from <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> as this may stimulate endogenous NOC formation, and consequently predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, serving as controls, were therefore recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fecal NOC were demonstrated in the majority of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By associating gene expression levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects to fecal NOC levels, we identified a NOC exposure-associated transcriptomic response that suggests that physiological NOC concentrations may potentially induce genotoxic responses and chromatin modifications in human colon tissue, both of which are linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858970" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a network analysis, chromatin modifications were linked to 11 significantly modulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> genes, pointing towards a possible epigenetic mechanism that may be relevant in comprehending NOC-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, pro-inflammatory transcriptomic modifications were identified in visually non-inflamed regions of the IBD colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, fecal NOC levels were slightly but not significantly increased in IBD patients, suggesting that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> did not strongly stimulate NOC formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that NOC exposure is associated with gene expression modifications in the human colon that may suggest a potential role of these compounds in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
