<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Adherence to medication that maintains remission by patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is poor but little is known regarding patients' perception of medication benefit that may enhance adherence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims were to study patients' understanding and preference on methods of conveying statistical information and to study indicated thresholds for adherence to medication for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four methods of displaying information on benefits of maintenance therapy were explained to patients with UC in remission: relative risk reduction [RR], absolute risk reduction [AR], number needed to treat [NNT] and optical representation via Cates plot [CP] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' understanding and preference for each method were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were asked to state minimum thresholds relating to relapse prevention and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk reduction that they would require in order for them to adhere to medication for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 50 participants, 48% preferred data presentation by RR over CP (28%), AR (20%) and NNT (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>94% found RR easy to understand, better than AR (88%), CP (74%), or NNT (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> prevention, 94% indicated adherence for benefit levels of 61% RR but only 57% for the corresponding CP (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For relapse prevention, 78% of patients indicated adherence for benefit levels of 40% RR but only 43% for the corresponding CP (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with UC prefer data presented by RR, and apply significantly higher thresholds for adherence when presented with CP compared to RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk may be a stronger motivator than maintenance of remission </plain></SENT>
