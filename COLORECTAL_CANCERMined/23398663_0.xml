<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to find the unplanned 30 day reoperation rate for patients having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery in NHS Lanarkshire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This retrospective study identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients having surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in NHS Lanarkshire between 2006-2008 from a prospective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR01) data were then examined for each patient to determine whether they returned to the operating theatre within 30 days of the index procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 573 patients had a primary operation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during the period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unplanned rate of reoperation within 30 days of surgery was 5.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between the hospital site, emergency or elective operation or laparoscopic resection or laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in reoperation rate between colorectal and general surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rate of unplanned reoperation in NHS Lanarkshire compares favourably to that of England however similar methodological problems exist </plain></SENT>
