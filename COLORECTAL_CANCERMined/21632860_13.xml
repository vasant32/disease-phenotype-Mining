<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: KRAS mutations represent the main cause of resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether highly sensitive methods for KRAS investigation improve the accuracy of predictions of anti-EGFR MoAbs efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively evaluated objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses in mCRC patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KRAS codons 12 and 13 were examined by direct sequencing, MALDI-TOF MS, mutant-enriched PCR, and engineered mutant-enriched PCR, which have a sensitivity of 20%, 10%, 0.1%, and 0.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we analyzed KRAS codon 61, BRAF, and PIK3CA by direct sequencing and PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 111 patients were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing revealed mutations in codons 12 and 13 of KRAS in 43/111 patients (39%) and BRAF mutations in 9/111 (8%), with almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these occurring in nonresponder patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using highly sensitive methods, we identified up to 13 additional KRAS mutations compared with direct sequencing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occurring in nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By analyzing PIK3CA and PTEN, we found that of these 13 patients, 7 did not show any additional alteration in the PI3K pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The application of highly sensitive methods for the detection of KRAS mutations significantly improves the identification of mCRC patients resistant to anti-EGFR MoAbs </plain></SENT>
