<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection of oligometastatic disease, including BM, may produce a survival benefit in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies described the HER-2 expression patterns in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, but its prognostic role still remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on the HER-2 expression in BM from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is currently lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the over 500 patients treated at our Department of Neurosurgery in the last 13 years (1999-2012), we identified a cohort of 50 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients resected for BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were retrospectively reviewed using electronic hospital charts and surgical notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples were retrieved and histologically reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HER-2 status was assessed on 4-μm sections by HerceptTest™, and scored by two pathologists according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> HER-2 status guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In score 2+ cases HER-2 gene copy number was analyzed by FISH, performed using the PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median age at time of BM resection was 65 years (35-82); most patients were males (60%) with a good performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of the BM were single (74%) and sited in the supratentorial area (64%); 2-4 lesions were diagnosed in 9 patients (18%), and &gt;4 in 3 patients (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of HER-2 positivity (defined as IHC score 3+ or IHC score 2+ and FISH gene amplification) was 8.1% for the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and 12% for their corresponding BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The concordance rate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> and matched BM was 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival after neurosurgery was 6.5 months for HER-2 IHC score 0 vs. 4.6 months for HER-2 IHC score 1+/2+/3+; the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.01, Log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>HER-2 positivity of our case cohort was low but comparable to literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Concordance rate of HER-2 expression between BM and corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> is high and similar to those reported for breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a potential negative prognostic value of HER-2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
