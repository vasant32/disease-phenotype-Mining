<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a few published papers have highlighted the existence of a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a better survival than expected; however, to date, there are no established parameters that usefully identify this category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have investigated the morphologic features, the CpG methylator phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability (MSI), and the immunohistochemical profile, including the expression of transcription factors (TTF1, ASH1, CDX2, and PAX5), stem cell markers (CD117 and CD34), and cytokeratins 7 and 20, in a series of 39 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (27 NECs and 12 MANECs) to better characterize such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and to search for prognostic indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No different patient survival was observed between NECs and MANECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasms</z:hpo> showed a heterogenous spectrum of morphologic and immunohistochemical features; however, only large-cell subtype, significant peritumoral lymphoid reaction, CD117 immunoreactivity, vascular invasion, and MSI/CIMP+ status were significantly correlated with prognosis on univariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, vascular invasion and CD117 immunoreactivity were independent prognostic markers on multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to these prognostic features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> showed different expression of transcription factors, stem cell markers, and cytokeratins that should be considered for diagnostic purposes and, especially, for discriminating among possible differential diagnoses </plain></SENT>
