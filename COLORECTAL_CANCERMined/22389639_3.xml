<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic alterations are, in contrast to genetic modifications, potentially reversible, making the use of dietary agents a promising approach in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for the development of chemopreventive strategies targeting epigenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
