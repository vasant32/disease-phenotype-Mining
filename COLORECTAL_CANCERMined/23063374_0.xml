<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monotherapy with monoclonal antibodies directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, has recently been introduced in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-minimization analysis comparing panitumumab with cetuximab in the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing mCRC with nonmutated (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>) Kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene homolog in Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The perspective of analysis was that of payers (Social Security Sickness Fund) and the country's National Health Service (NHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model was designed to contain probabilistic parameters to account for uncertainty and variation in these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> resources consumed in local hospitals in the management of patients in each case were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two analyses were performed: 1 evaluating cost per milligram and another evaluating cost per vial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a payer perspective, the mean 20-week total cost per patient for panitumumab and cetuximab was: (1) per-milligram analysis: €16,349 and €18,242, respectively; and (2) per-vial analysis: €18,808 and €19,701 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the NHS perspective, the mean total costs per patient were slightly higher; however, the use of panitumumab was associated with a 17.7% and 12.4% cost reduction in per-milligram and per-vial analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of probabilistic models confirmed those of the deterministic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the Greek NHS and Social Security Sickness Fund setting, panitumumab monotherapy potentially constitutes a cost-saving option (versus cetuximab monotherapy) in the management of patients with mCRC and no mutation of Kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene homolog </plain></SENT>
