<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) is an initial screening test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> primarily used in adults aged 50 years and older at average risk for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physicians and registered nurses have been shown to have the same effectiveness in performing a FS procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper presents an analysis of the use of registered nurses (RN) compared to physicians in Ontario to assess costs to the healthcare system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether FS performed by RNs is a less costly alternative to increase access to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening capacity in Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: A cost minimization analysis was conducted from a health system perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: RN-performed FS is a viable alternative for increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening capacity in Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remuneration schedules for on-call physicians must be taken into consideration if policies are developed for the implementation of RN screening procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The findings suggest that the use of RNs may be cost saving compared to physician-performed FS procedures, depending on physician remuneration </plain></SENT>
