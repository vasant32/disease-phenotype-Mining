<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in Denmark with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis in the DNRP and/or in the DCR from 2001 through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data quality was evaluated by estimating completeness and positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of data in different subcategories of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We estimated mortality and date of diagnosis, to evaluate the effect of potential differences in data quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall completeness of data in the DNRP for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 93.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 93.1-93.7] and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> was 88.9% (95% CI: 88.5-89.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Completeness and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> improved during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the completeness of data for patients &gt;75 years in the 2001-2003 period [88.8% (95% CI: 87.8-89.6)] was lower than average, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in more unspecific locations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in the colorectal junction also had lower estimates (below 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in survival estimates in the DNRP compared to the DCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study shows high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> data quality in the DNRP measured by completeness and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, except in a few subgroups </plain></SENT>
