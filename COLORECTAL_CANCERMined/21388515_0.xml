<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify genes that are involved in the metastatic phenotype, cDNA microarrays were used to analyse <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression profiles of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (CC)531 rat <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells for changes related to their homing into the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Briefly, CC531 cells were intraportally implanted into the liver of Wag-Rij rats and re-isolated after 3, 6, 9, 14 and 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to control CC531 cells, claudin1 and claudin4 were among the â‰¥8-fold initially down-regulated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The co-culture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells with isolated rat hepatocytes and Kupffer cells did not induce down-regulation of either claudin1 or 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the environment effective on circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells was simulated by cell culture conditions favouring their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, only claudin4 showed augmented expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of claudin1 and claudin4 mediated by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> caused significantly increased migration and decreased clonogenic growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells (P &lt; 0.05), but had no effect on their proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These experimental results were paralleled by increased claudin1 and claudin4 expression in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples in Union for International <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Control (UICC) stages I-III, as evaluated by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased claudin4 levels were correlated with significantly reduced overall survival (log-rank test, P= 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced expression of claudin1 and claudin4 was observed in stage IV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, sequential biphasic changes in claudin1 and claudin4 expression occur during the homing of rat CC531 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This modulation is reflected by significant changes in claudin expression in human primary and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
