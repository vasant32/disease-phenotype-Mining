<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) with an asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, there is no consensus on the indication for resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients with or without resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> treated in the phase III CAIRO and CAIRO2 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the CAIRO and CAIRO2 studies, 258 and 289 patients had undergone a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection and 141 and 159 patients had not, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the CAIRO study, a significantly better median overall survival and progression-free survival was observed for the resection compared to the nonresection group, with 16.7 vs. 11.4 months [P&lt;0.0001, hazard ratio (HR) 0.61], and 6.7 vs. 5.9 months (P=0.004; HR 0.74), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the CAIRO2 study, median overall survival and progression-free survival were also significantly better for the resection compared to the nonresection group, with 20.7 vs. 13.4 months (P&lt;0.0001; HR 0.65) and 10.5 vs. 7.8 months (P=0.014; HR 0.78), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences remained significant in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our review identified 22 nonrandomized studies, most of which showed improved survival for mCRC patients who underwent resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results as well as data from literature indicate that resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> is a prognostic factor for survival in stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potential bias of these results warrants prospective studies on the value of resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> in this setting; such studies are currently being planned </plain></SENT>
