<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we collected demographic, oncological and nutritional data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive mCRC patients during a 14-day period in eight hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nutritional status was assessed with the nutritional risk index (NRI), and patients were classified as severely malnourished when NRI was &lt;83.5; drug-induced toxicities were evaluated using the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival times were calculated from the date of the nutritional assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We enrolled 114 mCRC patients (median age: 65 years, range: 22-92; WHO performance status 0/1/2/3: 21/54/21/4%) of whom 88% had at least 2 metastatic sites and 49% were receiving chemotherapy as first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>Malnutrition</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 65% of the patients and was severe in 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> was associated with more adverse effects following chemotherapy (p = 0.01) and with shorter median overall survival (14.0 vs. 36.2 months in non-/moderately malnourished patients, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In mCRC patients, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> is associated with greater chemotherapy toxicity and reduced overall survival </plain></SENT>
