<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of our study was to verify a possible correlation between EGFR gene promoter methylation and clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients receiving chemotherapy with irinotecan and cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colorectal samples from patients treated with irinotecan-cetuximab were analysed for EGFR promoter methylation and EGFR immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (58%) showed EGFR promoter hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In EGFR promoter methylated and EGFR promoter unmethylated patients, we observed a partial response in 3 (10%) and 13 (59%) patients, respectively (P=0.03), progressive disease was obtained in 19 (63%) and 2 (9%) patients, respectively, with EGFR promoter methylated and EGFR promoter unmethylated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 2.4 months in patients showing EGFR promoter methylated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and 7.4 months for those who had EGFR promoter unmethylated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (P&lt;0.0001; Figure 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 6.1 months in patients showing EGFR promoter methylated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and 17.8 months for those who had EGFR promoter unmethylated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (P&lt;0.0001; Figure 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EGFR promoter hypermethylation, after confirmation in larger data set, may represent a valuable asset in further studies investigating EGFR as a therapeutic target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
