<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This information will be used to guide program strategies for increasing screening uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Qualitative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Family physicians (n = 65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven 1-hour focus groups were conducted with family physicians using teleconferencing and Web-based technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses were elicited regarding family physicians' perspectives on the mailing of invitations to patients, the content and design of the audit-feedback reports, the effect of participation in the pilot project on daily practice, and overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN FINDINGS: Key themes included strong support for both interventions and for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program generally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moderate support was found for direct mailing of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants identified potential pitfalls if interventions were implemented outside of patient enrolment model practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants expressed relatively strong support for colonoscopy as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test but relatively weak support for FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the proposed interventions to increase the uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were highly endorsed, concerns about their applicability to non-patient enrolment model practices and the current lack of physician support for FOBT will need to be addressed to optimize intervention and program effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study is highly relevant to other public health programs planning organized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programs </plain></SENT>
