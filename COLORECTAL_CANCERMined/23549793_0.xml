<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A societal perspective in economic evaluation necessitates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resources associated with a disease or intervention should be valued; however, informal care time costs are rarely considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We estimated time allocated to care by informal carers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors; and investigated the impact of applying alternative valuation methods to this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> cases (ICD10 C18-C20) diagnosed 6-30 months previously and identified from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry Ireland were invited to provide details of informal carers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carers completed a postal questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time estimates per week associated with hospital-related and domestic-related care activities were collected for two phases: diagnosis and initial treatment (initial 3 months) and ongoing care (previous 30 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven valuation scenarios, based on variants of the opportunity cost approach (OCA), and the proxy good approach (<z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi>), were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The base-case was OCA with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carer time valued at the average national wage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We received 154 completed questionnaires (response rate = 68 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average weekly time allocated to caring was 42.5 h in the diagnosis and initial treatment phase and 16.9 h in the ongoing care phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under the base-case, average weekly time costs were &lt;euro&gt;295 (95 % CI 255-344) for hospital-related activities and &lt;euro&gt;630 (95 % CI 543-739) for domestic-related activities in the diagnosis and initial treatment phase and &lt;euro&gt;359 (95 % CI 293-434) in the ongoing care phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> estimates were 23 % below the base-case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only one alternative scenario (occupation and gender-specific wages for carers in paid work and replacement wages for non-working carers) surpassed base-case costs, and the difference was modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, significant time is associated with informal caring in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Different time valuation methods can produce quite different cost estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A standardised methodology for estimating informal care costs would facilitate better integration of these into economic evaluations </plain></SENT>
