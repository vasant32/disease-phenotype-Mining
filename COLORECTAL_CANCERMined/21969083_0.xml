<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated a population-based improvement in adequate nodal harvest over time, particularly with the use of an audit and feedback strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this current study is to evaluate the impact of improved adequate nodal harvest on 3 relevant clinical outcomes: node positivity rate, use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This current population-based study included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing resection for primary stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Nova Scotia, Canada, from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage of the provincial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry with other administrative databases (hospital discharge data, physician claims data, and national census data) provided clinical, demographic, diagnostic, treatment event, and survival data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between increase in adequate node harvest and relevant clinical outcomes was examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and in a subgroup analysis of patients who received care in a health district that used audit and feedback to improve nodal harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 2,250 patients, the median nodal harvest was 8, and the overall node positive rate was 35.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite significant improvement in the proportion of patients undergoing adequate nodal harvest over time (P&lt;.0001), no significant change was observed in the node positivity rate (P=.51), proportion of patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy (P=.83), or survival (P=.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis confined to patients where audit and feedback was used to improve nodal harvest rates, clinical outcomes were not improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although improvements in the rate of adequate nodal harvest did occur over time, no corresponding meaningful improvement in clinical outcomes was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the need that quality indicators not only be associated with outcome, but also that outcome improves as such indicators are optimized, this study questions the inclusion of a nodal harvest≥12 lymph nodes as a quality indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
