<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colorectal surgery particularly as a treatment option for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> comprises considerable and ever expanding spectrum of surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seniors (over 65 years of age) form the majority of patients operated for benign or malignant colon disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High age in general poses one of the significant risks of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study analyses overall stress caused to patients by laparoscopy and laparotomy surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Literature analysis of surgical stress in patients and prospective study of our patients' data collected over the period of four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparable indicators: objectification of pre-operative stress and risks, per-operative cardiac and circulatory parameters, course of the lesion healing process, laboratory reactions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins, morbidity and <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> related to the surgery treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparable results of tissue response examinations demonstrated no fundamental difference between laparoscopic and laparotomic operations performed on otherwise healthy younger individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery, however, appears to be fully appropriate treatment modality in majority of patients suffering from colorectal disease, even in senior age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In advanced or complicated stages of the disease the open-section surgery still remains more efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Age itself cannot be generally denoted as a fundamental risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Co-morbid conditions, however, represent considerable risk, especially in high age patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery may well be applied even in senior age patients with no contra-indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Yet, its application requires perfectly mastered laparoscopic technique and rational approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Success of the operation in high-risk patients depends on close interdisciplinary cooperation, especially with anaesthetists </plain></SENT>
