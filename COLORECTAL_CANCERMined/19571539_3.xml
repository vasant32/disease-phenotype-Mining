<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 5,230 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at 14 hospitals from 1991 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were intensively followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time to relapse (TR) was classified into three groups as follows: group A, TR &lt; or =1 year; group B, TR &gt;1 year and &lt; or =3 years, and group C, TR &gt;3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognoses after relapse were compared among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 5,230 patients, 906 experienced relapse (17.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The curative resection rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumors</z:e> were 35.2% in group A, 46.6% in group B, and 45.1% in group C (p = 0.0045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the prognoses after relapse among the three TR groups in patients with relapse to the liver (p = 0.0175) and in those with local relapses (p = 0.0021), but not in those with pulmonary or anastomotic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in prognoses after relapse in any recurrence site among the three groups in patients who underwent curative resection for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If patients can undergo curative resection for relapse, they receive a survival benefit regardless of the timing of relapse </plain></SENT>
