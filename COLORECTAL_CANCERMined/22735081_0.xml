<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated oncologists' and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> nurses' opinions about resource use associated with infusion reactions and the impact on patient management in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty oncologists and nurses from Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK currently treating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were interviewed by telephone using a 27-item questionnaire developed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean estimated number of staff (physicians and nurses) involved in managing an infusion reaction was 1.97 for a grade 1, 2.35 for a grade 2, 3.6 for a grade 3 and 5.3 for a grade 4 reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In respondents' experiences, most patients with grade 3 infusion reactions (73.4%) were admitted to hospital for treatment; 82.5% of those with grade 4 infusion reactions were treated in intensive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated duration of hospital treatment was 13.3 ± 29 h for a grade 3 infusion reaction, increasing to 48.1 ± 43.7 h for a grade 4 infusion reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to respondents, management of infusion reactions led to substantial resource use, which increased with the severity of the reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More severe reactions also led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in patients and distress to staff </plain></SENT>
