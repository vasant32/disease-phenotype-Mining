<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in Spain between 2007 and 2009 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information about nutrient intake was gathered by using a semiquantitative frequency food questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis was done with individual food items </plain></SENT>
