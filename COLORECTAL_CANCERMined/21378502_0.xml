<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, the expression of 92 genes involved in 5FU transport, metabolism, co-factor (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>) metabolism and downstream effects was measured by real-time PCR low density arrays in 14 patient-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> xenografts characterised for 5FU resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Candidate gene function was tested by siRNA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> modulation, and immunoblotting, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictive significance was tested by immunohistochemistry of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> from 125 stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with and without 5FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 8 genes significantly differentially expressed between 5FU sensitive and resistant xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, CTPS2 was the gene with the highest probability of differential expression (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction of CTPS2 expression by siRNA increased the resistance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines DLD1 and LS174T to 5FU and its analogue, FUDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CTPS2 siRNA significantly reduced cell S-phase accumulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following 5FU treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>, a precursor to the CTPS2 substrate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>, also increased 5FU resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with low CTPS2 did not gain a survival benefit from 5FU treatment (p=0.072), while those with high expression did (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low CTPS2 expression may be a rationally-based determinant of 5FU resistance </plain></SENT>
