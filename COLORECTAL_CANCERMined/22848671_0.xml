<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk variants for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) have been mapped to chromosome positions 8q23.3, 8q24, 9p24.1, 10p14, 11q23, 14q22.2, 15q13, 16q22.1, 18q21, 19q13.1 and 20p12.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the 8q24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6983267, has reproducibly been associated with the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk SNPs may also influence disease outcome, thus in this study, we evaluated whether they influence patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: DNA samples from 583 CRC patients enrolled in the prospective, North Carolina <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium Study (NC CanCORS) were genotyped for 11 CRC susceptibility SNPs at 6 CRC risk loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relationships between genotypes and patient survival were examined using Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, patients homozygous for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk allele of rs7013278 or rs7014346 (both at 8 q24) were only nominally significant for poorer overall survival compared to patients homozygous for the protective allele (hazard ratio = 2.20 and 1.96, respectively; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of these associations, however, remained statistically significant after correction for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other nine susceptibility SNPs tested were not significantly associated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We did not find evidence of association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk variants with patient survival </plain></SENT>
