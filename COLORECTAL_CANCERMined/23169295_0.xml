<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The updated randomised phase 2/3 FIRIS study demonstrated the noninferiority of IRIS (irinotecan and S-1) to FOLFIRI (irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-FU) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, in the subset analysis including patients who previously have undergone <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy, the IRIS group showed longer survival than the FOLFIRI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism underlying this result is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute 60 (NCI60) cell line panel data were utilised to build the hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 45 irinotecan-naive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who had undergone hepatic resection were included for the validation study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), and topoisomerase-1 (TOP1) were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expressions of ERCC1 and DPD were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in 60 cell lines was significantly correlated with that of 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Resistant cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> showed significantly higher ERCC1 and DPD expression than sensitive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In validation study, ERCC1 and DPD but not TOP1 expressions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells were significantly higher in FOLFOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, folinic acid, and 5-FU)-treated patients (N=24) than nontreated patients (N=21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ERCC1 and DPD protein expressions were also significantly higher in FOLFOX-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ERCC1 and DPD expression levels at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were significantly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> as a first-line chemotherapy than those without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The IRIS regimens with the DPD inhibitory fluoropyrimidine may show superior activity against DPD-high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) compared with FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
