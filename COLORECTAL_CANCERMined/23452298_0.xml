<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using 2007-2010 hospital discharge data from the Premier database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population included adult patients with discharge diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 288.0x) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and receipt of intravenous antibiotics and female <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), or Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary study outcomes were inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and total hospitalization cost for each patient's first FN-related hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regressions (for mortality) and multivariate linear regressions (for LOS and cost) were conducted to assess the effect of comorbidities and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> types on study outcomes, adjusting for other patient and hospital characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Among 16,273 cancer patients hospitalized with FN, inpatient case fatality rate was 10.6%, mean LOS was 8.6 days, and mean total hospitalization cost was $18,880 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lung cancer</z:e> patients had the highest inpatient case fatality rate (15.7%), and NHL patients had the longest LOS (10.1 days) and the highest cost ($24,218) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses showed that most comorbidities were associated with a greater risk of mortality, longer LOS, and higher cost </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limitations: The total burden of FN may be underestimated in this study because outpatient treatment and any patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or costs that occurred outside of Premier hospitals could not be captured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: FN-related hospitalizations among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients are costly and accompanied by considerable mortality risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Substantial differences in the clinical and economic burden of FN exist depending on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types, comorbidities, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
