<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> treatment among older patients with stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to identify patient/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, physician, hospital, and geographic factors associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> use among older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals diagnosed at age &gt; 65 with stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 2004 through 2007 undergoing surgical resection and receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program (SEER)-Medicare database, which includes patient/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and hospital characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physician information was obtained from the American Medical Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poisson regression was used to identify independent predictors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> receipt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The discriminatory ability of each category of characteristics to predict <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> receipt was assessed by comparing the area under the receiver operating curve from logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 4388 individuals who underwent surgical resection at 773 hospitals and received chemotherapy from 1517 physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> use was higher among stage III (colon = 56%, rectum = 51%) compared to stage II patients (colon = 37%, rectum = 35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, patients who were older; diagnosed before 2006; separated, divorced, or widowed; living in a higher poverty census tract or in the East or Midwest; or with higher levels of comorbidity were less likely to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient factors and calendar year accounted for most of the variation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> receipt (area under the curve = 75.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> use increased rapidly from 2004 through 2007 despite uncertainties regarding its effectiveness in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Physician and hospital characteristics had little influence on adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> receipt among older patients </plain></SENT>
