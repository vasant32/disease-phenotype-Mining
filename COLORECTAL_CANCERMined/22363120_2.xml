<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate whether contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) might also be used for response prediction and early response evaluation in patients receiving bevacizumab based chemotherapy for metastasized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients with non primary resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> underwent CEUS before treatment (CEUS date 1) and before the second (CEUS date 2) and fourth (CEUS date 3) cycle of bevacizumab based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three parameters [PEAK, Time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and RISE RATE]were correlated with radiological response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For neoadjuvant purpose a reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> mass was required to assume clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these response criteria there was a significant (P &lt; 0.001) correlation in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> of responders (9.08 s) and non-responders (14.76 s) archived on CEUS date 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By calculating a standardized quotient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> divided by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver tissue) we were able to define a cut off, predicting response with a sensitivity of 92.3 % and a specificity of 100 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To reflect a palliative intention only those patients with progressive disease were classified as non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this stetting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was also significantly (P &lt; 0.01) different between responders and non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Peak and Rise rate did not show any significant difference between responder and non-responder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEUS might serve as a surrogate marker to predict treatment response in patients with metastasized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who receive antiangiogenic therapy </plain></SENT>
