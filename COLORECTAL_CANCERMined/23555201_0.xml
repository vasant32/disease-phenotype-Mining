<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study analysed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in England collected by the Office for National Statistics during 1993-2010 (n = 2,281,223) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time trends of age- and gender-standardised proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in individual PoDs were evaluated using weighted piecewise linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with PoD (home or hospice versus hospital) were determined using proportion ratio (PR) derived from the log-binomial regression, adjusting for clustering effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hospital remained the most common PoD throughout the study period (48.0%; 95% CI 47.9%-48.0%), followed by home (24.5%; 95% CI 24.4%-24.5%), and hospice (16.4%; 95% CI 16.3%-16.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Home and hospice <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> increased since 2005 (0.87%; 95% CI 0.74%-0.99%/year, 0.24%; 95% CI 0.17%-0.32%/year, respectively, p&lt;0.001), while hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> declined (-1.20%; 95% CI -1.41 to -0.99/year, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who died from haematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (PRs 0.46-0.52), who were single, widowed, or divorced (PRs 0.75-0.88), and aged over 75 (PRs 0.81-0.84 for 75-84; 0.66-0.72 for 85+) were less likely to die in home or hospice (p&lt;0.001; reference groups: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, married, age 25-54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was little improvement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> of dying in home or hospice (PRs 0.87-0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marital status became the second most important factor associated with PoD, after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients from less deprived areas (higher quintile of the deprivation index) were more likely to die at home or in a hospice than those from more deprived areas (lower quintile of the deprivation index; PRs 1.02-1.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The analysis is limited by a lack of data on individual patients' preferences for PoD or a clinical indication of the most appropriate PoD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: More efforts are needed to reduce hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Health care facilities should be improved and enhanced to support the increased home and hospice <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>People who are single, widowed, or divorced should be a focus for end-of-life care improvement, along with known at risk groups such as haematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer, lung</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, older age, and deprivation </plain></SENT>
