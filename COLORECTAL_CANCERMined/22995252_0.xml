<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim in this study was to unravel the molecular development of CIMP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> by dissecting their genetic and epigenetic signatures in precancerous and malignant colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We characterized the methylation profile and BRAF/KRAS mutation status in 368 colorectal tissue samples, including precancerous and malignant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, genome-wide copy number aberrations, methylation profiles, and mutations of BRAF, KRAS, TP53, and PIK3CA pathway genes were examined in 84 colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide methylation analysis of CpG islands and selected marker genes revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> precursor lesions are in three methylation subgroups: CIMP-high, CIMP-low, and CIMP-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a subset of CIMP-positive malignant lesions exhibited frequent copy number gains on chromosomes 7 and 19 and genetic defects in the AKT/PIK3CA pathway genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of mixed lesions containing both precancerous and malignant components revealed that most aberrant methylation is acquired at the precursor stage, whereas copy number aberrations are acquired during the progression from precursor to malignant lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our integrative genomic and epigenetic analysis suggests early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CIMP during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development and indicates a previously unknown <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development pathway in which epigenetic instability associates with genomic alterations </plain></SENT>
