<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay revealed that the IC50 of 7-PEC in HCT-116 cells was 1.5 µM after 72 h of treatment, much lower than that of chrysin (&gt;100 µM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data showed that 7-PEC was able to inhibit the growth of HCT-116 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Topical morphological changes of apoptotic body formation after 7-PEC treatment were observed by Hoechst 33258 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>7-PEC reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (∆Ψm) of cells in a concentration-dependent manner and increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment with 7-PEC, a significant increase of Bax protein expression and decrease of Bcl-2 protein expression were observed at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These events paralleled with activation of p53, caspase-3 and -9 and the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>‑c), as well as poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase-1 (PARP1) cleavage and downregulation of p-Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by 7-PEC was blocked by Ac-DEVD-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>, a caspase-3 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that 7-PEC-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in HCT-116 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells triggers events responsible for caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways, and the elevated ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 is likely involved in this effect </plain></SENT>
