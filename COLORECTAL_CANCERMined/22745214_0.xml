<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Molecular circadian clocks can modify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy effects, with a possible moderation according to sex differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether sex determine the optimal delivery schedule of chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed using individual data from three international Phase III trials comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> administered in chronomodulated (chronoFLO) or conventional (CONV) infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data from 345 females and 497 males were updated at 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main end point was survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall survival was improved in males on chronoFLO when compared with CONV (P = 0.009), with respective median values of 20.8 (95% CL, 18.7 to 22.9) and 17.5 months (16.1 to 18.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, median survival was 16.6 months (13.9 to 19.3) on chronoFLO and 18.4 months (16.6 to 20.2) on CONV in females (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sex versus schedule interaction was a strong predictive factor of optimal treatment schedule, with a hazard ratio of 1.59 (1.30 to 1.75) for overall survival (P = 0.002) in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Males lived significantly longer on chronomodulated chemotherapy rather than on conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current chronoFLO schedule deserves prospective assessment as a safe and more effective first-line treatment option than conventional delivery for male patients </plain></SENT>
