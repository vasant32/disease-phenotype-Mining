<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs are small regulatory <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that are able to regulate the activity and the stability of specific <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and have been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> due to their ability to translationally regulate critical oncogenes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our approach, data on protein-protein interactions and miRNA regulation, obtained from bioinformatics databases, are integrated with quantitative experimental data using mathematical modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictive computational simulations and qualitative (bifurcation) analyses of those mathematical models are employed to further support the investigation of such multifactorial networks in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We illustrate our approach with the C-Myc/E2F signalling network, involved in the progression of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> subtypes, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
