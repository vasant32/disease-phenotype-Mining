<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing regimens after curative resection for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> from 10 different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> centers between May 2004 and December 2009 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with FOLFOX regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were also treated with chemoradiotherapy with 5-FU after 2 cycles of a FOLFOX regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: The median age of the patients was 56 years (range 17-78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the total 667 patients, 326 were given FOLFOX-4, 232 were given modified FOLFOX-4 and 109 were given FOLFOX-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution according to disease stage was 33 patients with stage IIIA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 382 patients with stage IIIB and 252 patients with stage IIIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (54%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (36.9%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (38.2%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (33.1%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 23 months (range 1-79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 65 and 85.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> seemed to be at least equal in terms of efficacy regardless of the method of 5-FU administration or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
