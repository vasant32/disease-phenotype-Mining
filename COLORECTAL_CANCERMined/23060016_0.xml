<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current sampling methods to obtain microbial specimens, such as feces and mucosal biopsies, are inconvenient and unappealing to patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Obtaining samples through rectal swabs could prove to be a quicker and relatively easier method, but it is unclear if swabs are an adequate substitute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> diversity and composition from rectal swabs and rectal mucosal biopsies in order to examine the viability of rectal swabs as an alternative to biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paired rectal swabs and mucosal biopsy samples were collected in un-prepped participants (n = 11) and microbial diversity was characterized by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microbial community composition from swab samples was different from rectal mucosal biopsies (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> diversity was higher in swab samples than in biopsies as assessed by diversity indexes such as: richness (p = 0.01), evenness (p = 0.06) and Shannon's diversity (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> groups by qPCR showed higher copy number of Lactobacillus (p &lt; 0.0001) and Eubacteria (p = 0.0003) in swab samples compared with biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that rectal swabs and rectal mucosal samples provide different views of the microbiota in the large intestine </plain></SENT>
