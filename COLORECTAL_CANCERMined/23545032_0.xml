<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort comparison of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patient data from the NBCSP register and the South Australian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient records of those invited to take part in screening through the NBCSP, those who participated in the program, and those with positive test results were compared with those of the rest of the study population (excluding the group of interest) on an intention-to-screen basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at diagnosis as a surrogate marker for effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 3481 eligible patients, 221 had been invited to the NBCSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Invitees were more likely to have stage A lesions compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients (34.8% versus 19.2%; P &lt; 0.001), and half as likely to have stage D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (5.4% versus 12.4%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A further shift towards earlier stage was seen in those who participated in screening and those with positive test results compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients (38.8% stage A and 3.0% stage D in screening participants versus 19.3% stage A and 12.4% stage D in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients; and 39.7% stage A and 2.6% stage D in those with positive test results versus 19.3% stage A and 12.4% stage D in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were diagnosed at a significantly earlier stage in people invited to the NBCSP compared with those who were not invited, regardless of participation status or test result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The NBCSP should lead to reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality in Australia </plain></SENT>
