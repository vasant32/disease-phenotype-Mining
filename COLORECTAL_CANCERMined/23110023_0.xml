<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are no established reports about the expression of the Piwil gene, a subfamily of the Piwi gene involved in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> silencing and self-renewal, in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that the degree of PIWIL2 expression is higher in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But its clinicopathologic significance remains undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study reassessed the relationship between PIWIL2 expression and the clinicopathologic parameters in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An immunohistochemistry of PIWIL2 expression was done in 60 cases of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was followed by an analysis of the correlation between PIWIL2 expression and clinicopathologic features and a survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 44 cases (73.3%) where the degree of PIWIL2 expression was relatively higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high degree of PIWIL2 expression was significantly correlated with the lower degree of differentiation (p=0.039), deep invasion (p=0.019) and perineural invasion (p=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was longer in patients with the lower degree of PIWIL2 expression than in those with the higher degree of PIWIL2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the degree of PIWIL2 expression was relatively higher in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and it was significantly correlated with variable clinicopathologic indicators for a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This indicates that PIWIL2-positive cells contribute to the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
