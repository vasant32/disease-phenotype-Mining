<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preclinical studies suggest that bisphosphonates (BPs) may have direct antitumour effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the effect of exposure to BPs on the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Manitoba <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry was used to identify patients who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 2000 to 2009 who had been living in Manitoba for at least 5 years before diagnosis (cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each case was matched to 10 controls of similar age, sex, and duration of residence in Manitoba using incidence density sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure to BPs was determined using the provincial Drug Program Information Network database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of exposure to BPs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence with adjustment for health care use, medical procedures (including lower gastrointestinal endoscopy), socioeconomic status, and pre-existing health conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 5425 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were matched to 54,242 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, exposure to BPs was associated with a reduction in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (2-13 BP prescriptions over ≥5 years: odds ratio [OR] 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.00; ≥14 BP prescriptions over ≥5 years: OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the effect of specific BP agents was evaluated, the effect was significant only for exposure to risedronic acid (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30-0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant effect of increasing duration or cumulative dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2567">alendronic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggested that exposure to BPs, especially risedronic acid, may be associated with a decreased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
