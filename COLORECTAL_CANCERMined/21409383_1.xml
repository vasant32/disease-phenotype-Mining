<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of bevacizumab (BV) at steady-state under two different dosing regimens, 7.5 mg/kg q3w and 5.0 mg/kg q2w, concomitantly with a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (XELOX) and FOLFOX-4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in combination with infusional 5-FU/LV), respectively, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either XELOX + BV or FOLFOX-4 + BV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for steady-state PK of BV were collected on day 1 of cycle 5 (at the earliest) for XELOX + BV treatment and day 1 of cycle 7 (at the earliest) for FOLFOX-4 + BV treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were enrolled, of which 37 were eligible for PK analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary PK parameter of BV, AUC(ss(per week)), was statistically similar between the two dosing regimens with the 90% confidence interval in the commonly used no-effect boundaries of 0.8 and 1.25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The V (ss) and CL did not differ between the two regimens; t (½) during the PK cycle was also similar for both arms at approximately 16 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated no clinically relevant change in BV PK when co-administered with either XELOX or FOLFOX-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BV in combination with XELOX and FOLFOX-4 was generally well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients in the XELOX + BV arm and 15 patients in the FOLFOX-4 + BV arm experienced at least one SAE (most commonly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e>) which led to dose modification in 7 and 2 patients, respectively, and to premature withdrawal in 9 and 5 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 64 patients experienced at least one non-serious AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests and vital signs were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No clinically relevant differences in overall steady-state exposure of BV occurred when BV was given 7.5 mg/kg q3w in combination with XELOX or 5.0 mg/kg q2w with FOLFOX-4 in patients with mCRC, and the pharmacokinetics of BV were very similar between the two regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No unexpected adverse events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
