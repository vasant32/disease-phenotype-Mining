<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis aimed to evaluate clinical and histopathologic factors associated with 60-day mortality in first-line therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and disease-specific mortality rates from 479 patients who participated in a randomized phase III study comparing FUFIRI (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> [5-FU], leucovorin, irinotecan) (n = 238) vs. mIROX (modified irinotecan plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (n = 241) were evaluated for association with prognostic factors such as platelet counts, alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels, white blood cell (WBC) counts, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, and several other baseline parameters using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses applied to patients combined from both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause 60-day mortality rate was 5.0% (24/479) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (5.5%) in the FUFIRI arm died within the first 60 days of treatment compared with 11 (4.6%) patients in the mIROX arm (P = .68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 24 patients in both treatment arms, mortality was qualified as disease related in 15 (63%) patients and treatment related in 7 (29%) patients (P = .695) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, high LDH levels (P = .010) and an elevated WBC count (P = .006) remained as significant independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low Karnofsky performance status (KPS) showed a strong trend but failed to reach statistical significance (P = .057) as did AP levels and the number of metastatic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study 63% of the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were disease related, whereas only 29% were possibly related to study medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent prognostic factors for early mortality were LDH levels and WBC counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>KPS showed a strong trend in the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future investigation may consider LDH levels and WBC counts for exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
