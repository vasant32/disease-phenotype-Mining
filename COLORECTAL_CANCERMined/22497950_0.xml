<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) has been demonstrated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the palliative efficacy of stent placement inpatients with unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The medical records of patients who received SEMS for stage <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> colorectal obstruction between March 2004 and July 2010 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 patients with unresectable Stage <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> colorectal obstruction were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients received SEMS placement during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 63.0 years (range 35-84 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were male and nine were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common obstructive lesion was in the sigmoid colon (70.8%), including the sigmoid-descending and rectosigmoid junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Un-covered SEMS were used in 62.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the first attempt, the technical success rate of SEMS was 95.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The estimated duration of primary stent patency and overall survival periods after SEMS were 332.0 and 231.8 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SEMS insertion may be a useful therapeutic choice for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> colorectal obstruction in patients with unresectable stage <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
