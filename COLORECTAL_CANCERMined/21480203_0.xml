<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adjusting to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> requires effective cognitive and emotional processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Written and verbal disclosure facilitate processing and have been studied independently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Combined written and verbal expression may be more effective than either alone, particularly for patients with difficult to discuss or embarrassing side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the authors developed and tested the efficacy of a 12-session combined written and verbal expression group program for psychologically distressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty post-treatment patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (stages I-III) identified as psychologically distressed using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were randomized to an intervention group (Healthy Expressions; n = 25) or standard care (control group; n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessments were completed at baseline, Month 2, and Month 4 (postintervention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were psychological functioning and quality of life (QOL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most participants were women (63%), white (63%), and non-Hispanic (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Healthy Expressions group demonstrated significantly greater changes in distress compared with the control group at Month 2 on the BSI Global Severity Index (GSI) and the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D) scores (P &lt; .05 for each); differences in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (EORTC) global QOL scores approached significance (P = .063) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The BSI GSI and Positive Symptom Total, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D, and EORTC emotional functioning subscale scores were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant at Month 4 (P &lt; .05 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Healthy Expressions program improved psychological functioning in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who reported experiencing distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Findings demonstrate the program's feasibility and provide strong support for conducting a larger randomized trial </plain></SENT>
