<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are tiny non-coding small endogenous <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that regulate gene expression by translational repression, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> cleavage and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the hypermethylation of miR-34b/c and miR-148a in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and correlate this data to clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also aimed to evaluate the hypermethylation of miR-34b/c in faeces specimens as a novel non-invasive faecal-DNA-based screening marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> treatment and methylation-specific PCR were carried out to detect the hypermethylation of miR-34b/c and miR-148a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The miR-34b/c hypermethylation was found in 97.5% (79 out of 82) of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumours</z:e>, P=0.0110 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 75% (21 out of 28) of faecal specimens we found a hypermethylation of miR-34b/c while only in 16% (2 out of 12) of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, miR-148a was found to be hypermethylated in 65% (51 out of 78) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> tissues with no significant correlation to clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a trend with female gender and advanced age was found, P=0.083 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed a trend to lower survival rate in patients with miR-148a hypermethylation with 10-year survival probability: 48 vs 65%, P=0.561 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that aberrant hypermethylation of miR-34b/c could be an ideal class of early screening marker, whereas miR-148a could serve as a disease progression follow-up marker </plain></SENT>
